Existing methods usually improve generalization by scaling data and networks, but model tasks independently and overlook skill-level information. Observing that tasks within the same skill share similar motion patterns, we propose Skill-Aware Diffusion (SADiff), which explicitly incorporates skill-level information to improve generalization. SADiff learns skill-specific representations through a skill-aware encoding module with learnable skill tokens, and conditions a skill-constrained diffusion model to generate object-centric motion flow. A skill-retrieval transformation strategy further exploits skill-specific trajectory priors to refine the mapping from 2D motion flow to executable 3D actions. Furthermore, we introduce IsaacSkill, a high-fidelity dataset containing fundamental robotic skills for comprehensive evaluation and sim-to-real transfer. Experiments in simulation and real-world settings show that SADiff achieves good performance and generalization across various manipulation tasks.

For instance, Nair et al.\n[\n10\n]\nadopted time-contrastive learning to capture robust visual patterns, while Jia et al.\n[\n11\n]\nleveraged interaction prediction to model behavioral dynamics. However, these methods typically require large-scale data and extracted visual features inevitably include task-irrelevant elements (e.g., background details or textures), reducing their efficiency and precision.\nThe other direction formulates imitation learning as a two-stage framework, which first learns to predict future task-relevant motion representations (e.g., task video\n[\n12\n]\n, goal image\n[\n13\n]\n, or scene flow\n[\n14\n]\n) from easily accessible video data, and then leverages these representations as auxiliary inputs for visuomotor policy learning or directly maps them to executable actions. Among various motion representations, flow-based approaches\n[\n15\n,\n16\n]\nstand out for effectively emphasizing task-relevant motion dynamics while ignoring task-irrelevant visual distractions. However, attaining strong generalization with these methods remains dependent on large-scale training data. Moreover, such approaches face challenges in achieving a balance between robustness and precision when translating predicted 2D motion representations into executable 3D actions. For instance, learning-based strategies\n[\n14\n,\n15\n]\nare sensitive to intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters, while vanilla heuristic-based strategies\n[\n16\n,\n17\n]\nsuffer from unstable performance due to sensor noise.\nIn contrast, this work proposes to extract and leverage the correlations across diverse tasks for data-efficient generalization rather than relying on large-scale data.\nInspired by the fact that different tasks within the same skill domain exhibit similar motion patterns\n[\n18\n,\n19\n,\n20\n]\n, we exploit skill-level information as additional guidance and propose the Skill-Aware Diffusion (SADiff) framework to improve generalization in robotic manipulation. First, a skill-aware encoding module equips learnable skill tokens to capture skill-specific information during interacting with multimodal inputs. Then, a skill-constrained diffusion model generates object-centric motion flow conditioned on the produced skill-aware token sequences, allowing the model to capture unified features across diverse tasks within the same skill domain while preserving task-specific information. Two skill-specific auxiliary losses, i.e., skill classification and skill contrastive losses, are introduced to distinguish motion patterns across diverse skills to enhance precision and robustness.\nFinally, we propose a skill-retrieval transformation strategy that translates the generated 2D motion flow to executable 3D actions by retrieving skill-specific priors to refine the 2D-to-3D mapping. Through systematically incorporating skill-specific information, SADiff achieves superior generalization across diverse tasks and environments without relying on large-scale data.\nFurthermore, existing robotic manipulation datasets\n[\n21\n,\n22\n,\n23\n]\nprimarily focus on task completion rates, lacking the granularity required to evaluate specific manipulation skills. To address this limitation, we construct IsaacSkill, a new dataset specifically designed for skill-centric evaluation. Built upon the high-fidelity NVIDIA Isaac Lab platform\n[\n24\n]\n, IsaacSkill covers fundamental robotic skills applied to a variety of tasks. It not only enables a comprehensive assessment of specific skill capabilities, but also provides the realistic dynamics required to support robust sim-to-real transfer.\nIn summary, the contributions of this work are as follows:\n1)\nWe propose the SADiff framework to improve generalization in robotic manipulation by explicitly modeling skill-level representations and systematically integrating them into the encoding, generation, and execution phases.\n2)\nWe develop a skill-constrained diffusion model that generates object-centric motion flow conditioned on skill-aware token sequences, concurrently reinforced by skill contrastive learning for robust flow generation.\n3)\nWe design a skill-retrieval transformation strategy that uses skill-specific priors to refine the mapping from predicted object-centric 2D motion flow to executable 3D actions, improving precision and consistency without additional training.\n4)\nWe construct IsaacSkill, a new dataset on the high-fidelity NVIDIA Isaac Lab platform, covering fundamental skills across diverse tasks to enable skill-centric evaluation and facilitate zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.\nThe rest of this article is organized as follows. Section\nII\nreviews related work. Section\nIII\npresents the problem formulation. Section\nIV\ndetails the proposed method. Section\nV\npresents experimental results and comparisons. Section\nVI\nconcludes this article.\nII\nRelated Work\nIn this section, we review recent works in robotic manipulation that aim at learning from demonstrations and enhancing generalization to novel tasks and environments.\nII-A\nLearning from Demonstrations in Robotic Manipulation\nImitation learning, which enables robots to directly learn from collected demonstrations, has recently become a primary approach in robotic manipulation\n[\n8\n,\n25\n,\n26\n,\n27\n,\n28\n,\n29\n]\n.\nIn the standard imitation learning framework, a policy network is trained to replicate expert behavior by learning a mapping from state observations to the corresponding actions\n[\n28\n]\n.\nFor instance, ACT\n[\n8\n]\nemployed a CVAE-transformer to predict k-step action chunks from visual observations, enabling effective manipulation with a few demonstrations. Chi et al.\n[\n29\n]\nproposed diffusion policy to model complex action distributions through a denoising diffusion process, efficiently handling the multimodality of trajectories in collected demonstrations.\nTo enhance human-robot interaction, language-conditioned imitation learning has emerged to enable robots to execute tasks following instructions, where visual inputs and language instructions are integrated to plan executable actions\n[\n1\n,\n30\n,\n31\n]\n. For instance, CLIPort\n[\n32\n]\nleveraged a pretrained CLIP\n[\n33\n]\nmodel to align visual and language features, allowing robots to directly interpret and perform language-instructed tasks. PerAct\n[\n34\n]\nemployed a perceiver transformer\n[\n35\n]\nto integrate language features with voxelized RGB-D observations, enabling precise action prediction. However, these methods typically suffer from poor generalization in unseen scenarios due to their heavy reliance on extensive, task-specific demonstrations. Crucially, they often process tasks in isolation, ignoring the shared motion patterns that cut across diverse tasks and thus struggle to adapt efficiently to new environments.\nII-B\nImproving Generalization in Imitation Learning\nTo enhance the generalization in imitation learning for robotic manipulation, one intuitive direction is enhancing visual encoders by pre-training on large-scale manipulation-related datasets\n[\n36\n,\n37\n]\nin an end-to-\nend imitation learning framework\n[\n9\n,\n10\n,\n11\n,\n38\n]\n. For instance, R3M\n[\n10\n]\npre-trained visual encoders on human video data, using time-contrastive learning and video-language alignment to obtain robust visual features. MVP\n[\n38\n]\nleveraged masked image reconstruction to develop visual representations for generalized robotic motion control. In addition, MPI\n[\n11\n]\nintroduced interaction prediction as an auxiliary objective to model behavioral patterns and physical interactions, improving the generalization of the visuomotor policy. However, these methods typically rely on large-scale datasets for pre-training, which requires labor-intensive demonstration collection and massive computational resources. More importantly, extracted visual representations often contain task-irrelevant details, such as background clutter and textures, which inevitably affect performance.\nAnother key direction formulates imitation learning as a two-stage framework\n[\n12\n,\n14\n,\n39\n]\n. The first stage focuses on predicting future task-relevant motion representations, such as task video\n[\n12\n]\n, goal image\n[\n13\n]\n, and scene flow\n[\n14\n]\n. In the second stage, these representations are used as auxiliary inputs to facilitate visuomotor policy learning or directly transformed into executable actions. Among diverse motion representations, motion flow in 2D pixel space has become a powerful intermediate representation in motion planning since it can be easily extracted from raw video data with advancing point tracking methods and learned at scale\n[\n39\n]\n. Representatively, Track2Act\n[\n14\n]\nemployed a goal-conditioned grid flow model to generate future trajectories for query points and translated these trajectories into residual actions via a policy network. Im2Flow2Act\n[\n15\n]\nlearned object-centric motion flow to capture the dynamics of the target objects and translated the motion flow into actions via a flow-conditioned policy network, facilitating embodiment-agnostic manipulation. However, these methods still rely heavily on large-scale datasets. In general, previous methods tend to treat tasks in isolation, thereby overlooking shared prior across diverse tasks and ignoring the explicit modeling of skill-level information. As a consequence, such methods often struggle to effectively transfer knowledge to unseen scenarios. In contrast, we explicitly incorporate skill-specific representations to bridge different tasks, thereby enhancing generalization to new scenarios with similar underlying mechanics.\nII-C\nDiffusion Model in Robotic Manipulation\nRecently, the diffusion model has shown remarkable potential in robotic manipulation\n[\n40\n,\n41\n,\n42\n]\n. By iteratively denoising noise into structured actions or trajectories, diffusion-based approaches can effectively model the variability in demonstrations, enabling smooth action generation\n[\n43\n]\n. Previous works have pioneered the integration of denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) into visuomotor control, achieving superior performance by modeling the conditional probability of actions given visual inputs\n[\n29\n,\n44\n]\n. Subsequent research has further refined this paradigm by incorporating richer multimodal information (e.g., 3D visual representations\n[\n45\n]\nand tactile feedback\n[\n46\n]\n) together with more expressive geometric and semantic conditioning mechanisms\n[\n47\n]\n, thereby improving spatial reasoning and controllability of visuomotor policies.\nSome methods\n[\n17\n,\n48\n,\n49\n]\nleveraged diffusion models to generate future videos that serve as guidance for manipulation. For instance, UniPi\n[\n49\n]\nemployed a language-conditioned video diffusion model to synthesize future frames, subsequently using an inverse dynamics model to infer actions for execution. Unlike video-based methods that capture environmental details, flow-based methods focus on task-relevant motion dynamics, enabling more direct modeling of action-related movement patterns\n[\n14\n,\n15\n,\n50\n]\n. Following Im2Flow2Act\n[\n15\n]\n, SADiff adopts object-centric flow as the intermediate motion representation of task dynamics. Benefiting from the systematic integration of skill information into both the flow generation process and the 2D-to-3D action transformation, SADiff achieves improved robustness and generalization in various scenarios.\nFigure 1:\nOverview of the proposed Skill-Aware Diffusion (SADiff) framework. It is structured into three phases: (1) The encoding phase, where the skill-aware encoding module uses learnable skill tokens to interact with multimodal inputs and extract skill-specific information; (2) The generation phase, in which a skill-constrained diffusion model generates object-centric motion flow conditioned on the skill-aware token sequences, optimized by both denoising loss and two skill-specific auxiliary losses; and (3) The execution phase, which employs a skill-retrieval transformation strategy to translate the generated 2D motion flow into executable 3D trajectories by leveraging skill-specific priors.\nIII\nPreliminaries\nIII-A\nProblem Formulation\nFollowing existing works such as Im2Flow2Act\n[\n15\n]\nand Track2Act\n[\n14\n]\n, we decompose the robotic manipulation problem into two sub-problems. The first is flow generation, which aims to interpret the task from image observation and language instruction, and produce dense 2D motion flow that describes the pixel-level movement of the target object over a time horizon. The second sub-problem is to lift the 2D motion flow into a 3D trajectory and convert it into a sequence of executable actions through a flow transformation stage.\nFormally, given the task input of initial image observation\nI\nI\nand language instruction\nL\nL\n, the first sub-problem is to learn a flow generator\n𝒢\n\\mathcal{G}\nthat maps them to a 2D motion flow\nF\nF\n:\nF\n=\n𝒢\n​\n(\nI\n,\nL\n)\nF=\\mathcal{G}(I,L)\n(1)\nwhere\nF\n=\n{\nP\n1\n,\nP\n2\n,\n…\n,\nP\nT\n}\nF=\\{P_{1},P_{2},\\dots,P_{T}\\}\nrepresents the pixel-wise motion of the target object across\nT\nT\ntime steps,\nP\nt\nP_{t}\ndenotes a set of the 2D coordinates of keypoints on the target object at time step\nt\nt\n. The second sub-problem is to design a transformation strategy\n𝒯\n\\mathcal{T}\nthat maps the predicted flow\nF\nF\nto an executable action sequence\nA\nA\n:\nA\n=\n𝒯\n​\n(\nF\n)\nA=\\mathcal{T}(F)\n(2)\nwhere\nA\n=\n{\na\n1\n,\na\n2\n,\n…\n,\na\nT\n}\nA=\\{a_{1},a_{2},\\dots,a_{T}\\}\ndenotes the action sequence of end-effector over the task horizon, where each action\na\nt\na_{t}\nrepresents the 6-DoF end-effector pose at time step\nt\nt\n. We detailed the proposed approach in the following section.\nIII-B\nMotion Flow Extraction\nWe adopt the similar paradigm of motion flow extration as Im2Flow2Act\n[\n15\n]\n.\nFirst, we employ Qwen-VL\n[\n51\n]\nas an open-set detector to identify and locate the target object in the first frame of the video demonstration and obtain the corresponding bounding box. Then we uniformly sample a set of key points\nP\n1\n∈\nℝ\n2\n×\nN\nx\n×\nN\ny\nP_{1}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2\\times N_{x}\\times N_{y}}\nwithin the bounding box,\nwhere the first channel represents the 2D coordinates of the points, and\nN\nx\n×\nN\ny\nN_{x}\\times N_{y}\nindicates the number of sampled points. Next, we employ TAPIR\n[\n52\n]\nas a key-point tracker, which tracks the motion of each key-point across the entire video demonstration, yielding the motion flow of the target object. The extracted motion flow can be denoted as\nF\n=\n{\nP\n1\n,\nP\n2\n,\n…\n,\nP\nT\n}\n∈\nℝ\n2\n×\nN\nx\n×\nN\ny\n×\nT\nF=\\{P_{1},P_{2},\\dots,P_{T}\\}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2\\times N_{x}\\times N_{y}\\times T}\n, where each\nP\nt\nP_{t}\ncorresponds to the tracked key points in frame\nt\nt\n, and\nT\nT\nis the total number of frames in the demonstration.\nThe extracted motion flow serves as the training sample for the diffusion model.\nIV\nMethod\nFig.\n1\npresents the overview of SADiff. Its key components are detailed as follows: Section\nIV-A\nintroduces the skill-aware encoding module, which employs a set of learnable skill-aware tokens to capture skill-specific\ninformation while interacting with multimodal task inputs.\nSection\nIV-B\nintroduces the skill-constrained diffusion model that generates the motion flow of the target object conditioned on the skill-aware token sequences. We design a multi-objective training paradigm for flow generation that particularly introduces a skill contrastive training method for enhancing robustness. Finally, Section\nIV-C\ndetails the skill-retrieval transformation strategy, which uses skill-specific trajectory priors to guide the optimization-based transformation process, accurately converting the 2D motion flow into executable 3D actions.\nIV-A\nSkill-Aware Encoding\nWe design a skill-aware encoding module that performs interaction between multimodal inputs and extracts skill-specific information, as illustrated in Fig.\n2\n. The encoding process begins with an RGB image captured by a camera, represented as\nI\n∈\nℝ\nH\n×\nW\n×\n3\nI\\in\\mathbb{R}^{H\\times W\\times 3}\n. Given a language instruction\nL\nL\n, such as\n“Pour water from the black cup into the porcelain bowl”\n, we use an advanced vision-language model, i.e., Qwen-VL\n[\n51\n]\n, to identify and locate target objects\n“black cup”\nand\n“porcelain bowl”\n, extracting their bounding boxes\nB\n∈\nℝ\nN\no\n×\n4\nB\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N_{o}\\times 4}\n, where\nN\no\nN_{o}\nrepresents the number of related objects.\nTo capture skill-specific information and facilitate dynamic interactions across multimodal inputs, we introduce a set of learnable skill tokens, which are randomly initialized and represented as\nS\n∈\nℝ\nN\ns\n×\nD\nS\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N_{s}\\times D}\n, where\nN\ns\nN_{s}\ndenotes the number of skills. For a given task, skill-relevant tokens\nS\ni\n∈\nℝ\nD\nS_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D}\n, are selected from\nS\nS\nbased on image observation\nI\nI\nand language instruction\nL\nL\nwith an MLP-based skill classifier, where\ni\ni\nis the index of the relevant skill. Furthermore, we encode\nI\nI\n,\nL\nL\n,\nB\nB\n, and\nS\ni\nS_{i}\nindependently to obtain initial token sequences\nv\nI\nv_{I}\n,\nv\nL\nv_{L}\n,\nv\nB\nv_{B}\n,\nv\nS\ni\nv_{S_{i}}\n, all transformed to a common encoding dimension\nD\nD\n. Specifically, we use the pre-trained CLIP\n[\n33\n]\nto encode both image and language. The bounding boxes are encoded using 2D sinusoidal positional encoding\n[\n53\n]\n, capturing spatial relationships. And the skill tokens are encoded using a simple fully-connected layer.\nTo generate semantically rich skill representations and enable effective information exchange across multimodal token sequences, we employ multi-head self-attention (MHSA) and multi-head cross-attention (MHCA)\n[\n54\n]\n. These mechanisms enhance the interaction of image, text, and bounding box tokens with skill tokens, facilitating the alignment and fusion of multimodal information. For conciseness, the MHSA and MHCA mechanisms are formally defined as follows:\nMHSA\n​\n(\nX\n)\n=\nσ\n​\n(\nf\nQ\n​\n(\nX\n)\n​\nf\nK\n​\n(\nX\n)\n𝖳\n)\n​\nf\nV\n​\n(\nX\n)\n\\text{MHSA}(X)=\\sigma(f_{Q}(X)f_{K}(X)^{\\mathsf{T}})f_{V}(X)\n(3)\nand\nMHCA\n​\n(\nX\n,\nY\n)\n=\nσ\n​\n(\nf\nQ\n​\n(\nX\n)\n​\nf\nK\n​\n(\nY\n)\n𝖳\n)\n​\nf\nV\n​\n(\nY\n)\n\\text{MHCA}(X,Y)=\\sigma(f_{Q}(X)f_{K}(Y)^{\\mathsf{T}})f_{V}(Y)\n(4)\nwhere\nσ\n\\sigma\nis the softmax function, while\nf\nQ\nf_{Q}\n,\nf\nK\nf_{K}\n, and\nf\nV\nf_{V}\nrepresent the query, key, and value mapping functions, respectively.\nThe multimodal token sequencse\nv\nI\n,\nv\nL\n,\nv\nB\nv_{I},v_{L},v_{B}\nfirst undergoes initial self-encoding via MHSA, then the skill token sequences act as the query inputs, while the remaining token sequences serve as key and value inputs in MHCA. This process is followed by a feed-forward network (FFN) implemented with multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). The interaction process is expressed as:\nv\nx\n′\n=\nFFN\n​\n(\nMHCA\n​\n(\nv\nS\ni\n,\nMHSA\n​\n(\nv\nx\n)\n)\n)\nv^{\\prime}_{x}=\\text{FFN}(\\text{MHCA}(v_{S_{i}},\\text{MHSA}(v_{x})))\n(5)\nwhere\nx\n∈\n{\nI\n,\nL\n,\nB\n}\nx\\in\\{I,L,B\\}\n. The resulting skill-aware token sequences\nv\nS\ni\n,\nv\nI\n′\n,\nv\nL\n′\n,\nv\nB\n′\nv_{S_{i}},v^{\\prime}_{I},v^{\\prime}_{L},v^{\\prime}_{B}\nare used as conditioning inputs for the diffusion model in the subsequent flow generation stage. Unlike existing methods\n[\n15\n]\nthat often process multimodal inputs independently and rely on static feature alignment, our skill-aware encoding module introduces learnable skill tokens and leverages MHSA and MHCA mechanisms to dynamically align and fuse skill-specific features across modalities. Through this encoding process, the resulting skill-aware token sequences capture shared features across diverse tasks within the same skill category, while preserving task-specific details, thereby providing an effective condition for the following skill-constrained diffusion model.\nFigure 2:\nArchitecture of the skill-aware encoding module. The skill-aware encoding module integrates image, language, and bounding boxes of relevant objects with learnable skill tokens through attention-based interactions, producing skill-aware token sequences.\nIV-B\nSkill-Constrained Flow Generation\nTo generate a precise 2D object motion flow that is aligned with a specific skill, the current task, and the target objects, we propose a novel skill-constrained diffusion model. This model is equipped with a denoising loss to supervise flow generation and two auxiliary skill-specific losses that guide the model to capture semantic clues related to the skill. We first introduce the diffusion model for flow generation, and then explain how we design and leverage denoising loss and two auxiliary losses to train the model.\nIV-B\n1\nDiffusion Model for Flow Generation\nFirst, the motion flow\nF\nF\nis encoded into a latent representation space using a pre-trained VAE\n[\n55\n]\nencoder\nE\nϕ\n​\n(\n⋅\n)\nE_{\\phi}(\\cdot)\n, denoted as:\nz\n0\n=\nE\nϕ\n​\n(\nF\n)\nz_{0}=E_{\\phi}(F)\n(6)\nwhere\nz\n0\nz_{0}\nis the initial latent representation of the flow. Then the latent representation\nz\n0\nz_{0}\nis perturbed over\nk\nk\nsteps using the forward diffusion process to derive the perturbed latent representation\nz\nk\nz_{k}\n:\nz\nk\n=\nα\n¯\nk\n​\nz\n0\n+\n1\n−\nα\n¯\nk\n​\nϵ\n,\nϵ\n∼\n𝒩\n​\n(\n0\n,\nI\n)\nz_{k}=\\sqrt{\\overline{\\alpha}_{k}}z_{0}+\\sqrt{1-\\overline{\\alpha}_{k}}\\epsilon,\\epsilon\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,I)\\\n(7)\nwhere\nα\n¯\nk\n\\bar{\\alpha}_{k}\nis the cumulative noise schedule at step\nk\nk\nand\n𝒩\n​\n(\n0\n,\nI\n)\n\\mathcal{N}(0,I)\nis Gaussian noise distribution.\nSubsequently,\nz\nk\nz_{k}\nis processed by a UNet-based noise prediction network\nϵ\nθ\n\\epsilon_{\\theta}\nto predict perturbed noise, conditioned on skill-aware token sequences\nv\nS\ni\n=\n[\nv\nS\ni\n,\nv\nI\n′\n,\nv\nL\n′\n,\nv\nB\n′\n]\n\\textbf{v}_{S_{i}}=[v_{S_{i}},v^{\\prime}_{I},v^{\\prime}_{L},v^{\\prime}_{B}]\n:\nϵ\n^\n=\nϵ\nθ\n​\n(\nz\nk\n,\nv\nS\ni\n)\n\\hat{\\epsilon}=\\epsilon_{\\theta}(z_{k},\\textbf{v}_{S_{i}})\n(8)\nwhere\n[\n⋅\n]\n[\\cdot]\nis the concatenation operation, and\nϵ\n^\n\\hat{\\epsilon}\nis the predicted noise.\nAligning with AnimatedDiff\n[\n56\n]\nand Im2Flow2Act\n[\n15\n]\n, we integrate an MHSA layer as a motion module into\nϵ\nθ\n\\epsilon_{\\theta}\nthat performs information exchange on each spatial feature along the temporal dimension to capture temporal dependencies across frames.\nDuring inference, the reverse diffusion process starts by sampling random noise\nz\n^\nm\n∼\n𝒩\n​\n(\n0\n,\nI\n)\n\\hat{z}_{m}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,I)\nin the latent space. Then we iteratively denoise\nm\nm\ntimes to generate the latent\nz\n^\n0\n\\hat{z}_{0}\n. Finally, a pre-trained decoder\nD\nϕ\n​\n(\n⋅\n)\nD_{\\phi}(\\cdot)\nmaps the latent\nz\n^\n0\n\\hat{z}_{0}\nback to the pixel-space to generate object motion flow\nF\n^\n\\hat{F}\n:\nF\n^\n=\nD\nϕ\n​\n(\nz\n^\n0\n)\n.\n\\hat{F}=D_{\\phi}(\\hat{z}_{0}).\n(9)\nIV-B\n2\nSkill-Constrained Training\nTo ensure that the generated motion flow is precise and aligned with the intended skill, we train the diffusion model with a combination of the primary denoising loss for flow generation and two skill-specific auxiliary losses. Fig.\n3\nillustrates the overview of the skill-constrained diffusion model and its optimization objectives.\nDenoising Loss\nConsistent with previous diffusion-based approaches\n[\n15\n,\n56\n,\n57\n]\n, we adopt a mean squared error (MSE) loss between the predicted noise\nϵ\n^\n\\hat{\\epsilon}\nand the ground-truth noise\nϵ\n\\epsilon\n:\nℒ\nMSE\n=\n‖\nϵ\n^\n−\nϵ\n‖\n2\n.\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{MSE}}=\\left\\|\\hat{\\epsilon}-\\epsilon\\right\\|^{2}.\n(10)\nThis objective facilitates precise denoising by minimizing the divergence between predicted and ground-truth noise.\nSkill Classification Loss\nTo enable the skill-aware encoding module to select the optimal skill-relevant tokens from the full set of learnable skill tokens\nS\n∈\nℝ\nN\ns\n×\nD\nS\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N_{s}\\times D}\n, we design an auxiliary classification branch based on MLPs. Specifically, the image feature\nv\nI\nv_{I}\nand the language feature\nv\nL\nv_{L}\nencoded by the pre-trained CLIP encoder are concatenated and passed through the MLP-based skill classifier to predict the skill category\ny\n^\ni\n\\hat{y}_{i}\n, which indicates the most relevant skill tokens\nS\ni\n∈\nℝ\nD\nS_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D}\n. The selected tokens\nS\ni\nS_{i}\nare then used in the subsequent multimodal encoding stage as described in Section\nIV-A\n, ensuring that the skill-aware token sequences are produced correctly. To supervise this skill classification, we adopt a standard cross-entropy (CE) loss:\nℒ\nCE\n=\n−\n∑\ni\n=\n1\nN\ns\ny\ni\n​\nlog\n⁡\n(\ny\n^\ni\n)\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{CE}}=-\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{s}}y_{i}\\log(\\hat{y}_{i})\n(11)\nwhere\ny\ni\ny_{i}\nrepresents the one-hot encoded ground truth label for the skill category and\ny\n^\ni\n\\hat{y}_{i}\ndenotes the predicted logits.\nFigure 3:\nOverview of the skill-constrained diffusion model. The diffusion model generates motion flow by jointly optimizing skill classification loss, skill contrastive loss, and denoising loss to ensure accurate skill selection, semantic alignment, and precise flow generation.\nSkill Contrastive Loss\nTo further ensure that the diffusion model distinguishes between motion patterns of different skills and aligns them with their semantic descriptions, we propose a skill contrastive loss that aligns the intermediate features of\nϵ\nθ\n\\epsilon_{\\theta}\nwith the semantic representations of the pre-defined skill prompts. Specifically, we construct a skill prompt bank\nv\nC\n∈\nℝ\nN\ns\n×\nD\nv_{C}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N_{s}\\times D}\nby encoding high-level skill categories (e.g.,\n“Pouring”\n,\n“Picking and Placing”\n) using the CLIP text encoder.\nFor the target skill token\nS\ni\nS_{i}\n, the skill-aware token sequences are computed according to Eq.\n(\n5\n)\n, yielding the positive skill-aware sequence\nv\nS\ni\n=\n[\nv\nS\ni\n,\nv\nI\n′\n,\nv\nL\n′\n,\nv\nB\n′\n]\n\\textbf{v}_{S_{i}}=[v_{S_{i}},v^{\\prime}_{I},v^{\\prime}_{L},v^{\\prime}_{B}]\n, which is then feed as the condition for the UNet\nϵ\nθ\n\\epsilon_{\\theta}\n. We then extract the hidden feature representation from the middle layer of the UNet and project it to match the dimensionality of the CLIP features, which produces\nh\ni\nh_{i}\n.\nTo construct negative pairs, we treat all other skill tokens\nS\nj\n∈\nℝ\nD\nS_{j}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D}\n(\nj\n≠\ni\nj\\neq i\n) as negative instances which\nare processed identically to the positive sample to generate mismatching intermediate features\nh\nj\nh_{j}\n. Consequently, the positive pair\n(\nh\ni\n,\nv\nC\ni\n)\n(h_{i},v_{C_{i}})\nis contrasted against the negative pairs\n(\nh\nj\n,\nv\nC\ni\n)\n(h_{j},v_{C_{i}})\nto enforce semantic alignment in the feature space. We utilize cosine similarity to quantify the alignment:\nα\ni\n,\nj\n=\ncos\n​\n(\nh\ni\n,\nv\nC\nj\n)\n\\alpha_{i,j}=\\text{cos}(h_{i},v_{C_{j}})\n(12)\nThe skill contrastive loss is formulated as:\nℒ\nContrastive\n=\n−\nlog\n⁡\nexp\n⁡\n(\nα\ni\n,\ni\n/\nτ\n)\nexp\n⁡\n(\nα\ni\n,\ni\n/\nτ\n)\n+\n∑\nj\n≠\ni\nexp\n⁡\n(\nα\ni\n,\nj\n/\nτ\n)\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{Contrastive}}=-\\log\\frac{\\exp(\\alpha_{i,i}/\\tau)}{\\exp(\\alpha_{i,i}/\\tau)+\\sum_{j\\neq i}\\exp(\\alpha_{i,j}/\\tau)}\n(13)\nwhere\nτ\n\\tau\nis a temperature parameter. This objective encourages the model to align the intermediate feature\nh\ni\nh_{i}\nof the correct skill token with its corresponding skill prompt\nv\nC\ni\nv_{C_{i}}\n, while pushing the features\nh\nj\nh_{j}\nderived from incorrect skill tokens away from that prompt. This skill contrastive loss effectively constrains the diffusion model to distinguish between motion patterns of different skills during the denoising process.\nOverall Objective\nThe overall training objective is the weighted combination of the denoising loss and the two skill-constrained objectives:\nℒ\ntotal\n=\nℒ\nMSE\n+\nω\n1\n​\nℒ\nCE\n+\nω\n2\n​\nℒ\nContrastive\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{total}}=\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{MSE}}+\\omega_{1}\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{CE}}+\\omega_{2}\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{Contrastive}}\n(14)\nwhere\nω\n1\n\\omega_{1}\nand\nω\n2\n\\omega_{2}\nare hyperparameters that balance contributions of respective loss. By jointly optimizing these losses, the model learns to predict motion flow that is spatially precise and semantically aligned with the intended skill, thereby achieving robust and skill-aware motion flow generation.\nIV-C\nSkill-Retrieval Transformation from Flow to Actions\nMapping the predicted object-centric 2D motion flow\nF\n^\n=\n{\nP\n1\n,\nP\n2\n,\n…\n,\nP\nT\n}\n\\hat{F}=\\{P_{1},P_{2},\\dots,P_{T}\\}\ninto 3D space and transform it into executable actions is a critical step. In this section, we first formulate the conventional geometric optimization approach typically used, which serves as the foundation for our method. Subsequently, we will introduce our skill-retrieval strategy designed to refine this process.\nIV-C\n1\nMotion Estimation via Geometric Optimization\nGiven the initial depth observation captured by the RGB-D camera, the key-point set\nP\n1\nP_{1}\nin the first frame of\nF\n^\n\\hat{F}\nis back-projected into 3D space, resulting in\n𝒫\n1\n∈\nℝ\nN\n×\n3\n\\mathcal{P}_{1}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N\\times 3}\n, where\nN\nN\nrepresents the total number of tracked points. To obtain the 3D trajectory of the task-related object, we follow the standard formulation in AVDC\n[\n17\n]\n, modeling the rigid motion from the initial frame\nt\n1\nt_{1}\nto any subsequent frame\nt\nt\nusing a transformation matrix\n𝑻\nt\n1\n→\nt\n∈\nℝ\n4\n×\n4\n\\boldsymbol{T}_{t_{1}\\rightarrow t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{4\\times 4}\n. This matrix consists of a rotational component\n𝑹\nt\n1\n→\nt\n\\boldsymbol{R}_{t_{1}\\rightarrow t}\nand a translational component\n𝒕\nt\n1\n→\nt\n\\boldsymbol{t}_{t_{1}\\rightarrow t}\n, describing the object’s change in position and orientation within the camera coordinate system. To estimate\n𝑻\nt\n1\n→\nt\n\\boldsymbol{T}_{t_{1}\\rightarrow t}\ncorresponding to the predicted 2D motion flow\nF\n^\n\\hat{F}\n, we initialize it as an identity matrix and optimize the parameters by minimizing the reprojection error:\nE\nt\n=\n∑\nn\n=\n1\nN\n‖\nP\nt\n,\nn\n−\nK\n​\n𝑻\nt\n1\n→\nt\n​\n𝒫\n1\n,\nn\n‖\n2\nE_{t}=\\sum_{n=1}^{N}||P_{t,n}-K\\boldsymbol{T}_{t_{1}\\rightarrow t}\\mathcal{P}_{1,n}||^{2}\n(15)\nwhere\nE\nt\nE_{t}\ndenotes the optimization objective,\nP\nt\n,\nn\nP_{t,n}\nis the\nn\nn\n-th point in frame\nt\nt\nof the predicted flow,\nK\nK\ndenotes the camera intrinsic matrix, and\n𝒫\n1\n,\nn\n\\mathcal{P}_{1,n}\nrepresents the 3D coordinates of the\nn\nn\n-th point in\n𝒫\n1\n\\mathcal{P}_{1}\n.

To address these limitations, we introduce skill-specific trajectory priors into the optimization framework. These priors act as high-level guides, constraining the optimization process to motion patterns that are consistent with the intended skill, thereby enhancing both precision and physical consistency.\nSpecifically, we first construct a bank of trajectory templates offline. Utilizing monocular depth estimation (e.g., DepthAnythingV2\n[\n59\n]\n), we obtain pseudo-depth maps from video demonstrations to lift the extracted 2D motion flows into 3D space. For each skill category, we compute the average 3D trajectory from relevant demonstrations and normalize it spatially. The resulting normalized trajectories form a set of templates\nψ\n∈\nℝ\nN\ns\n×\nT\n×\n3\n\\psi\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N_{s}\\times T\\times 3}\n, where\nN\ns\nN_{s}\ndenotes the number of skills and\nT\nT\nrepresents the temporal sequence length. During the deployment phase, we retrieve the template\nψ\ni\n∈\nℝ\nT\n×\n3\n\\psi_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{T\\times 3}\ncorresponding to the predicted skill category of the current task. This normalized template is spatially aligned through translation and scaling based on the initial configuration of the task-related object, yielding a task-specific trajectory prior denoted as\nφ\n∈\nℝ\nT\n×\n3\n\\varphi\\in\\mathbb{R}^{T\\times 3}\n.\nWe introduce this prior into the optimization process by refining the objective function defined in Eq.\n(\n15\n)\n. The modified objective encourages the estimated 3D trajectory to minimize geometric reprojection error while simultaneously aligning with the retrieved skill prior:\nE\nt\n=\n∑\nn\n=\n1\nN\n‖\nP\nt\n,\nn\n−\nK\n​\n𝑻\nt\n1\n→\nt\n​\n𝒫\n1\n,\nn\n‖\n2\n+\nλ\n​\n∑\nn\n=\n1\nN\n‖\n𝒫\nt\n,\nn\n−\nφ\nt\n‖\n2\nE_{t}=\\sum_{n=1}^{N}||P_{t,n}-K\\boldsymbol{T}_{t_{1}\\rightarrow t}\\mathcal{P}_{1,n}||^{2}+\\lambda\\sum_{n=1}^{N}||\\mathcal{P}_{t,n}-\\varphi_{t}||^{2}\n(16)\nwhere\n𝒫\nt\n,\nn\n=\n𝑻\nt\n1\n→\nt\n​\n𝒫\n1\n,\nn\n\\mathcal{P}_{t,n}=\\boldsymbol{T}_{t_{1}\\rightarrow t}\\mathcal{P}_{1,n}\nrepresents the transformed 3D coordinate in frame\nt\nt\n,\nφ\nt\n\\varphi_{t}\ndenotes the corresponding waypoint from the skill prior\nφ\n\\varphi\n, and\nλ\n\\lambda\nis a hyperparameter balancing the two terms. By optimizing this joint objective, the system produces a transformation matrix\n𝑻\n^\nt\n1\n→\nt\n\\boldsymbol{\\hat{T}}_{t_{1}\\rightarrow t}\nthat are not only geometrically plausible but also robust to noise and faithful to the characteristic motion patterns of the skill. The complete pipeline of skill-retrieval transformation strategy is summarized in Algorithm\n1\n.\nIV-C\n3\nMapping to Executable Actions\nThe optimized transformation matrix is further transformed from the camera coordinate system to the robot base coordinate system. By applying the relative offset between the end-effector and the object, we derive the target 3D end-effector path. Inverse Kinematics (IK) is then applied to generate smooth joint position and velocity commands, completing the mapping from 2D flow to executable robotic actions.\nV\nExperiments\nIn this section, we first introduce the dataset construction in Section\nV-A\n, followed by the training details in Section\nV-B\n. Section\nV-C\npresents comparative evaluations across within-distribution, challenging generalization, and skill adaptation settings, alongside component-wise ablation studies in simulation. Section\nV-D\nverifies the method’s generalization and zero-shot sim-to-real transfer capabilities in real-world scenarios. Finally, Section\nV-E\nevaluates the scalability and composability of the proposed approach.\nFigure 4:\nOverview of the constructed IsaacSkill dataset. The dataset comprises five fundamental manipulation skills: “\nPouring\n”, “\nPicking&Placing\n”, “\nPushing\n”, “\nSlide Opening\n”, and “\nHinge Opening\n”. Each skill includes three different tasks involving different objects.\nV-A\nDataset Construction\nWhile datasets such as Meta-World\n[\n21\n]\n, RLBench\n[\n22\n]\n, and LIBERO\n[\n23\n]\nhave advanced the field of robotic manipulation, they rely on simplistic simulations with coarse physics and limited visual fidelity. Crucially, these simplified environments fail to capture the complex dynamics required for real-world interaction, rendering them inadequate for rigorous generalization evaluation and zero-shot sim-to-real transfer. To bridge this fidelity gap, we constructed IsaacSkill, a novel dataset built on the high-fidelity NVIDIA Isaac Lab\n[\n24\n]\nplatform, ensuring physically accurate dynamics and photorealistic scenarios. Furthermore, unlike prior works\n[\n15\n,\n14\n,\n17\n]\nthat focus on a narrow set of isolated tasks, IsaacSkill is structured around 5 fundamental robotic skills: “\nPouring\n”, “\nPicking & Placing\n”, “\nPushing\n”, “\nSlide Opening\n”, and “\nHinge Opening\n”. This skill-centric approach allows us to encompass a wide variety of tasks involving diverse objects and scenarios, as shown in Fig.\n4\n. To ensure robustness, we design 3 different tasks per skill, introducing high variability in object geometry, texture, and placement, alongside randomized distractor objects. In total, the dataset comprises 2,400 trajectory demonstrations (160 per task), providing a comprehensive benchmark for skill-generalizable manipulation.\nIn our dataset, the robotic platform consists of a Franka Emika Panda manipulator equipped with a parallel-jaw gripper. A single RGB camera is mounted in a third-person perspective, positioned at an elevated frontal angle to capture the entire workspace. During data collection, we employ an oracle policy to ensure successful execution for each task. The resulting demonstrations are recorded as single-view RGB videos and temporally downsampled to 32 frames to maintain consistency. To extract the motion flow of task-relevant objects, we leverage Qwen-VL\n[\n51\n]\nto first localize target objects based on language instructions. Subsequently, keypoints are uniformly sampled within the detected bounding boxes and tracked throughout the video sequence using the TAPIR tracker\n[\n52\n]\n.\nV-B\nTraining Details\nThe training process is decoupled into two stages. In the first stage, the encoder\nE\nϕ\n​\n(\n⋅\n)\nE_{\\phi}(\\cdot)\nand the decoder\nD\nϕ\n​\n(\n⋅\n)\nD_{\\phi}(\\cdot)\nare trained within an autoencoder framework. We initialize both components using pre-trained Stable Diffusion\n[\n60\n]\nweights, but keep the encoder frozen while fine-tuning the decoder on our dataset.\nIn the second stage, the noise prediction network\nϵ\nθ\n\\epsilon_{\\theta}\nis trained. Its parameters are also initialized from Stable Diffusion\n[\n60\n]\n, except for the motion module, which is trained from scratch. The remaining layers are fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation\n[\n61\n]\n(LoRA) to ensure parameter efficiency. We employ the AdamW optimizer with an initial learning rate of\n1\n×\n10\n−\n5\n1\\times 10^{-5}\n, utilizing a cosine decay schedule. The hyperparameters for the loss function in Eq.\n(\n14\n)\nare set to\nω\n1\n=\n0.01\n\\omega_{1}=0.01\nand\nω\n2\n=\n0.02\n\\omega_{2}=0.02\n. All training is conducted on four NVIDIA A100 GPUs.\nV-C\nSimulation Experiments\nV-C\n1\nExperiment Setup\nWe conduct simulation experiments on the proposed IsaacSkill dataset. Four baseline methods representing diverse paradigms are selected for comparison:\n•\nR3M\n[\n10\n]\n: A behavior cloning approach utilizing pre-trained visual representations. It leverages temporal contrastive learning and video-language alignment to extract semantically rich features for robust policy learning.\n•\nAVDC\n[\n17\n]\n: A video prediction framework that synthesizes task-specific future frames and derives executable actions by analyzing dense pixel correspondences between adjacent predicted frames.\n•\nTrack2Act\n[\n14\n]\n: A trajectory-centric method that employs a goal-conditioned grid flow model to generate future trajectories for query points. These trajectories are subsequently mapped to residual actions via a specific policy network.\n•\nIm2Flow2Act\n[\n15\n]\n: A flow-based approach that generates object-centric motion flows, which serve as conditions for a policy network to output executable actions.\nTo comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed SADiff, we structure our simulation experiments into four main parts:\n•\nWithin-Distribution Comparative Experiment\n: We first assess the fundamental imitation capabilities of SADiff and baselines on tasks consistent with the training distribution.\n•\nRobustness and Generalization Analysis\n: We rigorously test the model’s robustness against variations in visual context, object instances, categories, and robotic embodiments to evaluate out-of-distribution performance.\n•\nInstruction-Guided Skill Adaptation Experiment\n: We examine the model’s flexibility in adapting to changing language instructions while the scene configuration remains constant.\n•\nAblation Studies\n: Finally, we isolate and quantify the contributions of key components, including learnable skill tokens, skill contrastive loss, and skill-specific trajectory priors.\nIn all the aforementioned experiments, we compare our method against baselines over 25 independent rollouts, reporting the average Success Rate (SR) as the primary metric. To ensure robust evaluation, each rollout features randomly initialized positions for task-related objects, as well as randomized types and placements for interfering objects. In the following sections, we present the detailed results and analysis for each experimental setting.\nV-C\n2\nWithin-Distribution Comparative Experiment\nTo evaluate the fundamental imitation capability of the proposed method, we conduct a standard within-distribution comparative experiment, serving as a primary baseline for imitation performance. The scenes and task-related objects are sampled from the exact same distributions as the collected dataset, ensuring a rigorous assessment of the system’s ability to recall and execute demonstrated skills.\nTABLE I:\nComparison of Success Rates (%) Across Different Skills in Within-Distribution Comparative Experiment\nMethod\nPouring\nPicking&\nPlacing\nPushing\nSlide\nOpening\nHinge\nOpening\nAverage\nSR\nR3M\n[\n10\n]\n64.0\n64.0\n52.0\n60.0\n60.0\n60.0\nAVDC\n[\n17\n]\n64.0\n68.0\n84.0\n92.0\n72.0\n76.0\nTrack2Act\n[\n14\n]\n88.0\n80.0\n76.0\n80.0\n88.0\n82.4\nIm2Flow2Act\n[\n15\n]\n84.0\n92.0\n88.0\n92.0\n84.0\n88.0\nSADiff (Ours)\n92.0\n96.0\n92.0\n96.0\n88.0\n92.8\nThe experimental results are presented in Table\nI\n. SADiff consistently outperforms all baselines across the five skills, achieving a state-of-the-art average success rate of 92.8%. Notably, SADiff surpasses the closest competitor, Im2Flow2Act (88.0%), by a margin of 4.8%. Since Im2Flow2Act also leverages object-centric flow, this performance gain directly highlights the efficacy of explicitly modeling skill-level information, thereby refining the quality of generated motion flows and improving the accuracy of action transformation. Conversely, methods modeling global scene dynamics, including Track2Act (82.4%) and AVDC (76.0%), achieve lower success rates because their full-frame synthesis or dense grid tracking increases susceptibility to background perturbations. SADiff addresses this limitation by centering strictly on task-relevant objects, effectively filtering out visual noise. Moreover, R3M (60.0%) yields the lowest success rate, indicating that pre-trained general-purpose visual representations struggle to disentangle fine-grained, task-specific dynamics from environmental distractors. Collectively, these results confirm that integrating skill-aware priors with focused object dynamics is essential for robust manipulation in within-distribution settings.\nFigure 5:\nOverview of the generalization evaluation settings. Left: The original collected demonstration. Right: The model is evaluated under four different types of variations involving distribution shifts in backgrounds, intra-category instances, cross-category objects, and embodiment.\nV-C\n3\nRobustness and Generalization Analysis\nTo rigorously evaluate the robustness and generalization of SADiff, we design experiments across diverse scenarios that deviate significantly from the training distribution. Specifically, we investigate the performance under four different types of variations involving backgrounds, object instances, object categories, and embodiment. As illustrated in Fig.\n5\n, the four generalization settings are designed as follows:\n•\nBackground Generalization\n: This setting introduces variations in lighting conditions and background while keeping the task-related objects consistent with the training set.\n•\nIntra-Category Instance Generalization\n: This setting evaluates the model on unseen instances of task-related objects that differ in color, shape, and physical appearance within the same category.\n•\nCross-Category Generalization\n: This setting challenges the model by replacing task-related objects with functionally similar objects from entirely different categories (e.g., replacing a cup with a bottle).\n•\nCross-Embodiment Generalization\n: This setting assesses cross-embodiment generalization by replacing the Franka Panda manipulator with a UR10 robotic arm equipped with a Robotiq two-finger gripper.\nThe quantitative results averaged across five skills in Fig.\n6\ndemonstrate that SADiff consistently surpasses all baselines across every generalization setting. In the background and intra-category instance generalization scenarios, SADiff achieves robust average success rates of 89.6% and 86.4% by leveraging skill-level guidance to overcome visual variations. This mechanism prevents the incoherent flows observed in Im2Flow2Act and mitigates the visual distractions that degrade the performance of R3M, AVDC, and Track2Act.\nIn the cross-category generalization setting, SADiff maintains an 82.4% success rate while AVDC and R3M fail completely and other baselines suffer performance drops exceeding 20%. These results indicate that skill priors effectively bridge the gap between different object categories. Furthermore, the cross-embodiment setting reveals that R3M fails due to proprioception mismatches and AVDC cannot synthesize plausible future frames for the unseen robot. While Track2Act and Im2Flow2Act also suffer significant degradation due to limited adaptability, SADiff incurs only a 5.6% performance drop. This stability arises from the skill-specific trajectory priors that enable effective adaptation to novel robotic platforms. Overall, these experiments validate that the skill-aware design of SADiff is essential for robust generalization across visual, object, and embodiment variations.\nFigure 6:\nAverage success rate (%) of baselines and SADiff under different generalization scenarios. SADiff consistently achieves the highest average success rate across all four generalization settings.\nV-C\n4\nInstruction-Guided Skill Adaptation Experiment\nTo further investigate whether the proposed SADiff can overcome spurious scene-task correlations and prioritize semantic instructions over visual priors, we design a instruction-guided adaptation experiment. In this setup, the physical scene configuration and object placements remain identical to the training distribution, but the language instruction is altered to command a different manipulation skill. As illustrated in Fig.\n7\n, a scene originally associated with a “\nPicking&Placing\n” task is redefined as a “\nPushing\n” task during testing. This protocol rigorously evaluates whether the model can flexibly adapt its behavior to new semantic instructions rather than simply memorizing scene-task correlations. We define four specific cross-skill adaptation tasks:\n•\nTask 1\n: “\nPicking&Placing\n”\n→\n\\rightarrow\n“\nPushing\n”\n•\nTask 2\n: “\nPushing\n”\n→\n\\rightarrow\n“\nPicking&Placing\n”\n•\nTask 3\n: “\nPouring\n”\n→\n\\rightarrow\n“\nPicking&Placing\n”\n•\nTask 4\n: “\nPouring\n”\n→\n\\rightarrow\n“\nPushing\n”\nThe experimental results in Table\nII\nhighlight the superior flexibility of SADiff, which achieves an average success rate of 85.0% and significantly outperforms all baselines. R3M and AVDC exhibit a complete inability to adapt with 0% success rates, because they rigidly rely on the specific scene-task correlations learned during training. Similarly, Im2Flow2Act performs poorly with only 16.0% success as its flow generation is overly constrained by the visual scene rather than the language instruction. Although Track2Act fares slightly better with 41.0% due to goal-image conditioning, it still lacks the semantic grasp necessary to consistently execute the new skill. SADiff successfully overcomes these limitations by explicitly classifying the modified instruction into a known skill category during inference. This mechanism allows the model to leverage learned skill representations and generate appropriate actions that align with the new command even when the visual environment suggests a different task.\nFigure 7:\nExamples of the instruction-guided adaptation scenario. The model is evaluated on its ability to switch manipulation skills within an unchanged visual environment solely by following modified language instructions.\nTABLE II:\nComparison of Success Rates (%) of Instruction-Guided Skill Adaptation Experiment\nMethod\nTask 1\nTask 2\nTask 3\nTask 4\nAverage SR\nR3M\n[\n10\n]\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\nAVDC\n[\n17\n]\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\nTrack2Act\n[\n14\n]\n44.0\n52.0\n32.0\n36.0\n41.0\nIm2Flow2Act\n[\n15\n]\n20.0\n16.0\n12.0\n16.0\n16.0\nSADiff (Ours)\n88.0\n84.0\n88.0\n80.0\n85.0\nV-C\n5\nAblation Studies\nTo systematically assess the individual contributions of each core component, we perform ablation experiments following the identical evaluation protocol utilized for the Robustness and Generalization Analysis in Section\nV-C\n3\n. Specifically, we evaluate performance across background, intra-category instance, and cross-category generalization settings. The three ablated variants are defined as follows:\n•\nw/o Learnable Skill Tokens (LST)\n: This variant removes the learnable skill tokens, along with the related skill classification loss and skill contrastive losses.\n•\nw/o Skill Contrastive Loss (SCL)\n: In this variant, the skill contrastive loss in Eq.\n(\n14\n)\nis removed.\n•\nw/o Skill Trajectory Priors (STP)\n: In this variant, the skill-specific trajectory prior in Eq.\n(\n16\n)\nis disabled.\nThe results are shown in Table\nIII\n.\nRemoving the Learnable Skill Tokens (LST) causes the average success rate to decline from 86.1% to 75.7%. This drop indicates that without explicit skill representations, the model loses the ability to dynamically modulate multimodal inputs with skill-specific context, severely hampering adaptability in unseen scenarios. Excluding the Skill Contrastive Loss (SCL) results in a decrease to 81.1%, suggesting that without skill-level constraints during the denoising process, the diffusion model generates motion flows that drift from the intended manipulation semantics. Most critically, removing the Skill Trajectory Priors (STP) leads to the sharpest performance degradation to 66.9%. This underscores that trajectory priors are essential for stabilizing the transformation from 2D motion flow to 3D executable actions. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that SADiff relies on the tight coupling of skill-aware encoding, constrained diffusion, and prior-guided transformation to achieve robust generalization.\nTABLE III:\nComparison of Success Rates (%) of Ablation Studies\nMethod\nBackground\nGeneralization\nInstance\nGeneralization\nCross-Category\nGeneralization\nAverage\nSR\nSADiff\n89.6\n86.4\n82.4\n86.1\nw/o LST\n84.8\n74.4\n68.0\n75.7\nw/o SCL\n86.4\n81.6\n75.2\n81.1\nw/o STP\n73.6\n62.4\n64.8\n66.9\nV-D\nReal-World Experiments\nV-D\n1\nExperiment Setup\nIn real-world experiments, we employ a UR5 robotic manipulator equipped with a Robotiq gripper and an Intel RealSense D435i camera, which is mounted on the front-upper side of the workspace to maintain consistency with the simulation setup. To evaluate the generalization ability and zero-shot sim-to-real transfer capability of the proposed SADiff, we directly deploy the model trained purely in simulation without any real-world fine-tuning.\nWe compare our approach against Track2Act\n[\n14\n]\nand Im2Flow2Act\n[\n15\n]\n, as other baselines like R3M\n[\n10\n]\nand AVDC\n[\n17\n]\nlack the capability for direct transfer.\nFor each skill, we conduct 25 independent rollouts. To rigorously test robustness, we follow the simulation setting by randomly initializing the positions of task-related objects and introducing randomized types and placements for visual distractors in each trial.\nFigure 8:\nVisualization of real-world experiments. This figure demonstrates the predicted object-centric motion flow and the corresponding execution trajectories for five manipulation skills in the real world.\nFigure 9:\nQualitative evaluation under environmental variations. We subject the model to a variety of test scenarios featuring diverse backgrounds, complex lighting conditions, and unseen object instances to assess its visual robustness.\nV-D\n2\nExperiment Results\nThe results are summarized in Table\nIV\n. SADiff achieves an average success rate of 76.0%, outperforming Im2Flow2Act by 21.6% and Track2Act by 25.6% across all five skills. The primary challenge to achieving robust zero-shot sim-to-real transfer lies in pervasive domain discrepancies between simulation and physical environments. These discrepancies include substantial changes in visual scenes and illumination conditions, sensor noise, variations in object types, and embodiment differences.\nThese factors typically cause severe performance degradation for policies trained exclusively in simulation.\nBaseline methods struggle considerably under these conditions. Although Track2Act can generate query-point trajectories conditioned on goal images, it is highly sensitive to visual domain shifts, which degrades trajectory quality. Furthermore, its residual policy, which was trained to map 2D trajectories to actions for a specific simulated agent, generalizes poorly to the physical robot. Similarly, Im2Flow2Act leverages Grounding-DINO\n[\n62\n]\nto identify task-relevant objects, yet it falters when generating object-centric motion flows for novel scenes or unseen instructions. Crucially, its learned policy for converting 2D flow into executable actions relies heavily on fixed camera parameters, limiting its adaptability to real-world setups.\nTABLE IV:\nComparison of Success Rates (%) Across Different Skills in Real-World Experiment\nMethod\nPouring\nPicking&\nPlacing\nPushing\nSlide\nOpening\nHinge\nOpening\nAverage\nSR\nTrack2Act\n[\n14\n]\n44.0\n52.0\n56.0\n48.0\n52.0\n50.4\nIm2Flow2Act\n[\n15\n]\n56.0\n60.0\n56.0\n58.0\n42.0\n54.4\nSADiff (Ours)\n72.0\n80.0\n80.0\n76.0\n72.0\n76.0\nIn contrast, SADiff effectively bridges the sim-to-real gap by injecting skill-level knowledge into both the flow generation and action transformation stages. As demonstrated by the real-world results, SADiff retains strong performance without requiring domain randomization or fine-tuning. This consistent superiority validates two key advantages: (1) explicit skill modeling stabilizes diffusion-based motion generation against visual noise, and (2) the skill-retrieval transformation module reliably converts predicted motion flow into executable actions, even across different robotic embodiments. These findings confirm that SADiff not only excels in simulation but also robustly handles embodiment changes and physical variations in real-world environments. Fig.\n8\nvisualizes the predicted object-centric motion flows and corresponding execution trajectories for five skills, providing further qualitative evidence of the model’s robustness.\nIn addition, we investigate the time efficiency of the proposed framework in real-world deployment. We measured the average planning time for flow generation, 2D-to-3D mapping, and the average execution time, as shown in Table\nV\n. Despite the latency introduced by the utilization of the VLM and the iterative sampling process of the diffusion model, the total time remains within a reasonable range, demonstrating the system’s capability for practical real-time deployment.\nTABLE V:\nPlanning and Execution Time for Five Skills in Real-World Experiments\nTime Phases\nPouring\nPicking&\nPlacing\nPushing\nSlide\nOpening\nHinge\nOpening\nPlanning Time (s)\n18.4\n23.1\n17.2\n16.9\n17.8\nExecution Time (s)\n28.2\n21.9\n10.6\n14.5\n15.2\nV-D\n3\nQualitative Analysis under Environmental Variations\nBeyond standard performance metrics, we further qualitatively evaluate how the policy behaves under extreme visual distractions and domain discrepancies.\nWe extended the experimental evaluation to include real-world scenarios characterized by significant environmental variations. As illustrated in Fig.\n9\n, we introduced three different types of domain shifts to challenge the visual robustness:\n•\nDifferent Backgrounds\n: We altered the workspace environment by changing tablecloths with varying textures and colors to test robustness against background clutter.\n•\nDifferent Lighting\n: We introduced complex lighting conditions, including drastic changes in color and intensity, to evaluate the model’s insensitivity to illumination shifts.\n•\nDifferent Objects\n: We substituted the manipulation targets with unseen object instances that differ in shape, size, and appearance.\nWe constructed a diverse evaluation set comprising 30 different tasks spanning all five manipulation skills. Despite domain shifts and visual distractions, SADiff demonstrates remarkable adaptability. The qualitative results indicate that our method effectively disentangles target object dynamics from environmental noise. This resilience is attributed to the object-centric nature of the predicted motion flow, which, when combined with the structural constraints of skill-specific priors, enables SADiff to maintain high success rates even in highly unstructured and visually novel environments. These findings further validate the potential of SADiff for robust open-world deployment.\nV-E\nScalability and Composability Experiments\nTo bridge the gap between specialized manipulation policies and general-purpose robotic agents, it is crucial to verify capabilities beyond standard task repetition. Specifically, real-world deployment requires an agent to not only generalize to new, untrained behaviors but also to seamlessly sequence mastered skills to solve complex, multi-stage problems. To further validate the scalability and robustness of the proposed SADiff in these advanced settings, we consider two essential properties: (1) scalability to unseen skills absent from the training dataset, demonstrating the transferability of our skill representations; and (2) composability for completing long-horizon tasks by chaining multiple skill executions. All experiments utilize the pre-trained SADiff model trained on the proposed IsaacSkill dataset without any additional fine-tuning, evaluated in both simulated and real-world environments.\nV-E\n1\nScalability to Unseen Skills\nWe validate scalability by introducing two unseen skills, “\nStacking\n” and “\nWiping\n”, which were entirely absent from the training phase.\nAs visualized in Fig.\n10\n, SADiff successfully generates coherent and temporally consistent motion flows for both tasks, enabling reliable translation into stable action trajectories. This zero-shot generalization is achievable because the fundamental skills in our training set (e.g.,\n“Picking & Placing” and “Pushing”\n) share underlying motion patterns with these novel skills. Consequently, SADiff can effectively approximate the required behaviors for unseen skills like “\nStacking\n” and “\nWiping\n” by leveraging the learned primitives from these foundational skills. These results demonstrate that the proposed SADiff framework can seamlessly extend to semantically and kinematically related behaviors without additional training. Furthermore, this experiment suggests that as the category of fundamental skills in IsaacSkill expands, the model’s capacity to master increasingly complex and diverse tasks will scale correspondingly.\nV-E\n2\nComposability for Long-Horizon Tasks\nTo verify the composability of our approach, we evaluate SADiff on long-horizon tasks that require sequential execution of multiple skills. For a complex task instruction such as\n“Put the apple in the lower drawer”\n, we leverage Qwen-VL\n[\n51\n]\nas a VLM-based planner, prompting it to decompose the high-level goal into actionable subtasks conditioned on visual observations and the language command. Subsequently, SADiff generates object-centric motion flows for each subtask and maps them into executable actions. As illustrated in the representative rollouts in Fig.\n11\n, this decoupling strategy enables the flexible composition of diverse skills while leveraging the robust generalization capabilities of SADiff to handle task complexity. The successful execution in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrates the seamless composability of our framework and validates its potential for completing complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks.\nFigure 10:\nDemonstration of the scalability of SADiff to unseen skills. We showcase that SADiff can successfully perform new skills (e.g., “\nStacking\n” and “\nWiping\n”) unseen during training in both simulated and real-world environments.\nFigure 11:\nDemonstration of the composability of SADiff for long-horizon tasks. We assess the model’s capability to execute multi-stage manipulation sequences by decomposing complex instructions into sequential subtasks.\nVI\nConclusion\nIn this work, we propose SADiff, a skill-aware diffusion framework designed to improve generalization in robotic manipulation through explicit modeling of skill-level information. By integrating a skill-aware encoding module equipped with learnable skill tokens, a skill-constrained diffusion model, and a skill-retrieval transformation strategy, SADiff effectively captures shared skill-level information within the same skill domain and systematically integrates it across the encoding, generation, and execution phases. This allows it to precisely generate object-centric motion flow and robustly map the 2D flow to executable 3D actions in diverse scenarios and environments. Furthermore, we construct a high-fidelity IsaacSkill dataset, which not only enables a comprehensive assessment of specific skill capabilities but also provides the realistic dynamics required to support robust sim-to-real transfer. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that SADiff significantly outperforms existing methods in generalization to unseen objects, varying environments, and distinct embodiments, and achieves zero-shot sim-to-real transfer. These results underscore the pivotal role of explicitly modeling skill-level knowledge and integrating it throughout all phases of the pipeline. Moreover, SADiff demonstrates scalability and composability by successfully generalizing to unseen skills and composing multiple learned skills to execute long-horizon manipulation tasks.\nAlthough SADiff demonstrates strong generalization and zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, it still faces several limitations. Firstly, the skill taxonomy is manually specified, which constrains the expressiveness of the skill space when extending the framework to more complex or fine-grained manipulation tasks. Future work could explore unsupervised skill discovery, such as using VQ-VAE\n[\n63\n]\nto extract and structure semantic skills from various demonstrations. Secondly, the 2D motion flow representation struggles to fully resolve spatial dynamics in tasks with out-of-plane rotations (e.g., unscrewing a bottle cap). Future work could extend our framework to utilize 3D motion flow\n[\n64\n]\nfor more precise robotic manipulation.\nReferences\n[1]\nH. Zhou, X. Yao, Y. Meng, S. Sun, Z. Bing, K. Huang, and A. Knoll, “Language-conditioned learning for robotic manipulation: A survey,”\narXiv preprint arXiv:2312.10807\n, 2023.\n[2]\nW. Zhao, J. Chen, Z. Meng, D. Mao, R. Song, and W. Zhang, “Vlmpc: Vision-language model predictive control for robotic manipulation,” in\nRobotics: Science and Systems\n, 2024.\n[3]\nO. Mees, L. Hermann, and W. Burgard, “What matters in language conditioned robotic imitation learning over unstructured data,”\nIEEE Robotics and Automation Letters\n, vol. 7, no. 4, pp. 11 205–11 212, 2022.\n[4]\nT. Ma, J. Zhou, Z. Wang, R. Qiu, and J. Liang, “Contrastive imitation learning for language-guided multi-task robotic manipulation,” in\nConference on Robot Learning\n. PMLR, 2025, pp. 4651–4669.\n[5]\nF. Lin, Y. Hu, P. Sheng, C. Wen, J. You, and Y. Gao, “Data scaling laws in imitation learning for robotic manipulation,” in\nThe Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations\n.\n[6]\nZ. Chen, Z. Mandi, H. Bharadhwaj, M. Sharma, S. Song, A. Gupta, and V. Kumar, “Semantically controllable augmentations for generalizable robot learning,”\nThe International Journal of Robotics Research\n, vol. 44, no. 10-11, pp. 1705–1726, 2025.\n[7]\nT. Zhang, Z. McCarthy, O. Jow, D. Lee, X. Chen, K. Goldberg, and P. Abbeel, “Deep imitation learning for complex manipulation tasks from virtual reality teleoperation,” in\n2018 IEEE international conference on robotics and automation (ICRA)\n. Ieee, 2018, pp. 5628–5635.\n[8]\nT. Z.

    "preview_text": "Robust generalization in robotic manipulation is crucial for robots to adapt flexibly to diverse environments. Existing methods usually improve generalization by scaling data and networks, but model tasks independently and overlook skill-level information. Observing that tasks within the same skill share similar motion patterns, we propose Skill-Aware Diffusion (SADiff), which explicitly incorporates skill-level information to improve generalization. SADiff learns skill-specific representations through a skill-aware encoding module with learnable skill tokens, and conditions a skill-constrained diffusion model to generate object-centric motion flow. A skill-retrieval transformation strategy further exploits skill-specific trajectory priors to refine the mapping from 2D motion flow to executable 3D actions. Furthermore, we introduce IsaacSkill, a high-fidelity dataset containing fundamental robotic skills for comprehensive evaluation and sim-to-real transfer. Experiments in simulation and real-world settings show that SADiff achieves good performance and generalization across various manipulation tasks.

            "answer": "## 论文前作分析\n\n根据论文内容，作者团队（或相关研究者）在机器人操作领域，特别是基于扩散模型和运动流表示方面，已有系列工作。以下表格详细梳理了其核心前作，并重点分析了本文（SADiff）与这些前作的区别与改进。\n\n| 前作名称 | 核心方法 / 贡献 | 与 SADiff 的主要区别 | SADiff 的主要改进 / 创新点 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Im2Flow2Act** <br> (Xu et al., 2024) | 提出了一个两阶段框架：<br> 1. **生成以物体为中心的运动流**：学习从视觉观察和语言指令中预测目标物体在2D像素空间的运动轨迹。<br> 2. **流条件策略网络**：将预测的2D运动流作为条件，通过一个策略网络直接映射为可执行的3D机器人动作。其核心是使用**物体中心流**作为中间表示，以过滤背景干扰，实现与具体机器人本体无关的操作。 | 1. **任务建模方式**：将每个任务视为独立的，**没有显式地建模和利用技能层面的共享信息**。<br> 2. **编码方式**：对多模态输入（图像、语言、边界框）进行**独立编码和静态特征对齐**，缺乏跨模态的动态交互和技能信息的注入。<br> 3. **流生成**：使用标准的条件扩散模型生成流，**缺乏针对技能语义的约束**。<br> 4. **2D到3D映射**：依赖于一个**需要训练的策略网络**来将2D流转换为动作，该网络对相机参数和机器人本体敏感，泛化能力受限。 | 1. **引入技能感知编码**：设计了带有**可学习技能令牌**的编码模块，通过多头注意力机制动态地与多模态输入交互，**显式提取并融合技能特定信息**，生成技能感知的令牌序列作为条件。<br> 2. **技能约束的扩散模型**：在扩散模型的训练中，除了去噪损失，新增了**技能分类损失**和**技能对比损失**。后者强制模型在去噪过程中，使中间特征与技能语义描述对齐，从而**确保生成的运动流在语义上与目标技能一致**。<br> 3. **技能检索变换策略**：提出了一种**无需训练**的2D到3D动作变换方法。它**检索技能特定的轨迹先验**，并将其作为优化约束，引导基于几何重投影误差的优化过程，**显著提升了跨本体、跨场景的映射鲁棒性和精度**。<br> 4. **系统性技能整合**：将技能信息**系统性**地贯穿于编码、生成、执行三个阶段，而前作仅停留在任务级别的流生成。 |\n| **Track2Act** <br> (Bharadhwaj et al., 2024) | 也是一个两阶段方法：<br> 1. **基于互联网视频预训练**：学习一个目标条件化的网格流模型，预测查询点的未来轨迹。<br> 2. **残差策略网络**：将预测的2D轨迹通过一个策略网络映射为机器人的残差动作。其特点是利用大规模网络视频数据学习通用的点跟踪先验。 | 1. **表示粒度**：关注**场景级**的密集网格流或点轨迹，而非**物体中心**的流，更容易受到背景杂乱和无关物体运动的干扰。<br> 2. **条件信息**：主要依赖于目标图像作为条件，**对语言指令的利用和与技能的关联较弱**。<br> 3. **动作生成**：同样依赖一个**需要训练的策略网络**进行2D到3D的映射，且该网络是针对特定机器人本体训练的，泛化能力差。<br> 4. **数据依赖**：严重依赖大规模互联网视频数据进行预训练。 | 1. **物体中心与技能感知**：SADiff 坚持**物体中心流**表示，并注入技能信息，能更精准地捕捉任务相关物体的动态，并利用技能共性。<br> 2. **数据效率**：通过利用技能层面的共享知识，SADiff 在**不依赖超大规模数据**的情况下实现了更好的泛化。<br> 3. **更鲁棒的变换机制**：用**基于技能先验的优化方法**替代了需要训练的策略网络，实现了**零样本**的跨本体泛化，而 Track2Act 的策略网络难以适应新的机器人。<br> 4. **多模态技能理解**：通过技能感知编码，**深度整合了语言指令与技能分类**，能更好地依据指令切换技能。 |\n| **AVDC** <br> (Ko et al., 2023) | 属于**视频预测**范式：<br> 1. **生成未来任务视频**：使用扩散模型根据当前观察生成未来的任务执行视频帧。<br> 2. **稠密对应分析**：通过分析预测帧之间的稠密像素对应关系（如光流）来推导出可执行的动作。 | 1. **中间表示**：使用**完整的RGB视频帧**作为中间表示，包含了大量与任务无关的环境细节（纹理、背景），引入了噪声。<br> 2. **信息密度**：从视频中提取动作信息是间接的，需要额外的后处理（稠密对应计算），且容易受视觉变化影响。<br> 3. **技能抽象**：完全没有考虑技能层面的抽象，其生成过程是**任务特定和场景特定**的，泛化性更弱。 | 1. **更高效的表示**：SADiff 使用**物体中心运动流**作为中间表示，直接建模动作相关的运动动态，**摒弃了视觉冗余**，更高效、更鲁棒。<br> 2. **显式技能建模**：AVDC 是隐式地学习任务模式，而 SADiff **显式地引入技能作为高级别指导**，使模型能理解不同任务间的共性，从而更好地泛化。<br> 3. **更直接的动作生成链路**：SADiff 的流到动作的变换链路更直接、更几何化，受视觉外观变化的影响远小于从视频中解析动作的AVDC。 |\n\n### 总结：SADiff 相对于前作的核心演进\n\n1.  **从“任务孤立”到“技能共享”**：前作（如 Im2Flow2Act, Track2Act）将每个任务独立处理，忽略了共享相同运动模式的技能层面信息。SADiff 的核心创新是**显式地建模和利用技能信息**作为跨任务迁移的桥梁。\n2.  **从“静态特征”到“动态技能交互”**：改进了编码方式，通过**可学习技能令牌和注意力机制**，实现了多模态输入与技能信息的动态交互与融合，生成了富含技能语义的条件表示。\n3.  **从“无约束生成”到“语义约束生成”**：在扩散模型训练中引入了**技能对比损失**，这是一种**创新性的约束**，确保生成的2D运动流不仅在空间上准确，在语义上也与目标技能对齐，提升了流的质量和泛化性。\n4.  **从“数据驱动映射”到“先验引导优化”**：最大的改进之一在于2D到3D的变换阶段。SADiff 用**无需训练的技能检索变换策略**，取代了前作中需要大量数据训练、且泛化能力弱的策略网络。通过引入**技能特定的轨迹先验**作为优化约束，该方法对传感器噪声、深度模糊和机器人本体变化都表现出极强的鲁棒性，实现了零样本的跨本体泛化。\n5.  **系统性框架设计**：SADiff 不是单个组件的改进，而是构建了一个**将技能信息系统性整合**（编码 -> 生成 -> 执行）的完整框架，这是与前作点状突破的本质区别。\n\n**总而言之，SADiff 的改进是根本性的：它将研究的焦点从“如何为单个任务生成更好的运动流”提升到了“如何利用技能这一抽象层，让模型学会一类任务的共性，从而实现数据高效、强泛化的机器人操作”。** 其实验结果在分布内任务、多种泛化设置（背景、物体类别、本体）以及零样本模拟到现实转移上的全面领先，验证了这套技能感知方法论的有效性。",

            "answer": "## 论文主要局限性分析\n\n根据论文的结论部分（Section VI）和实验分析，**Skill-Aware Diffusion (SADiff)** 框架存在以下主要局限性：\n\n### 1. 技能分类依赖人工定义\n- **问题描述**：论文中使用的技能分类（如“倾倒”、“抓放”、“推动”等）是**手动预先定义**的。这限制了技能空间的表达能力和可扩展性。\n- **具体影响**：当面对更复杂、更精细或未预定义的操纵任务时，这种固定的技能分类体系可能无法有效捕捉或生成所需的运动模式，从而影响模型的泛化能力。\n\n### 2. 2D运动流在复杂3D运动中的局限性\n- **问题描述**：SADiff使用**2D像素空间的对象中心运动流**作为中间运动表示。这种表示方法在处理涉及**平面外旋转**（如拧瓶盖、旋转物体）的任务时存在困难。\n- **具体影响**：2D流无法完全解析物体在三维空间中的完整姿态变化，导致在这些任务上生成的轨迹可能不精确或不稳定，限制了框架在更广泛任务上的适用性。\n\n### 3. 计算效率与实时性挑战\n- **问题描述**：尽管论文指出总时间在可接受范围内，但框架涉及多个计算密集型模块：\n    - **视觉语言模型 (VLM)**：用于目标检测和指令理解。\n    - **扩散模型迭代去噪**：生成运动流需要多步采样。\n    - **基于优化的2D到3D映射**：使用非线性最小二乘优化。\n- **具体影响**：这可能导致**规划延迟**（如表V所示，规划时间约17-23秒），对于需要快速响应的实时机器人应用可能构成瓶颈。\n\n### 4. 对预训练模型和外部工具的依赖\n- **问题描述**：框架严重依赖多个外部预训练模型：\n    - **Qwen-VL**：用于目标检测和边界框生成。\n    - **CLIP**：用于多模态特征对齐。\n    - **TAPIR**：用于关键点跟踪以提取训练用的运动流。\n- **具体影响**：这些模型的性能、偏差和泛化能力会直接影响SADiff的上限。任何模块的失败（如检测错误、跟踪丢失）都可能级联导致整个系统失败。\n\n---\n\n## 未来可能的改进方向\n\n基于上述局限性，论文在结论部分提出了明确的未来研究方向，并可从技术角度进行延伸：\n\n### 1. 探索无监督技能发现\n- **方向**：使用**无监督或自监督学习**方法（如**VQ-VAE**）从大量未标注的演示数据中自动发现和结构化技能表示。\n- **潜在价值**：可以构建更丰富、更细粒度、更具可扩展性的技能库，使模型能够适应更广泛和更复杂的任务，减少对人工定义的依赖。\n\n### 2. 采用3D运动流表示\n- **方向**：将中间表示从**2D像素运动流**升级为**3D运动流**或**3D场景流**。\n- **潜在价值**：能够更精确地建模物体在三维空间中的完整运动（包括旋转和平移），从而显著提升在涉及复杂空间动力学任务（如装配、拧螺丝）上的性能。\n\n### 3. 提升计算效率与实时性\n- **方向**：\n    - **模型轻量化**：对扩散模型使用更高效的架构或蒸馏技术。\n    - **加速采样**：采用更快的扩散模型采样器（如DDIM、DPM-Solver）。\n    - **优化策略改进**：探索学习式的2D到3D映射网络，替代耗时的基于优化的方法。\n- **潜在价值**：使系统更适合**实时交互**和**在线学习**场景。\n\n### 4. 端到端学习与鲁棒性提升\n- **方向**：\n    - **减少模块化**：探索将运动流生成与动作转换更紧密地耦合，甚至进行端到端训练，以减少误差传播。\n    - **增强鲁棒性**：针对传感器噪声、视觉干扰和领域差异，设计更强的数据增强或对抗训练策略。\n- **潜在价值**：提高系统在混乱真实世界环境中的**稳定性和可靠性**。\n\n### 5. 扩展技能组合与长时程规划\n- **方向**：虽然论文初步探索了技能组合，但未来可以集成更强大的**高层任务规划器**（如基于LLM/VLM的规划器），实现更复杂、多步骤的长时程任务自主分解与执行。\n- **潜在价值**：推动机器人从执行单一技能向完成**复杂目标导向任务**迈进。\n\n### 总结\nSADiff的核心创新在于**显式地建模和利用技能级信息**来提升泛化能力，其当前局限性主要集中在**技能定义的灵活性、空间表示的完备性以及系统的计算效率**。未来的改进将围绕**自动化技能获取、三维空间建模和系统优化**展开，旨在构建更通用、更高效、更鲁棒的机器人操纵系统。",
