To address these challenges, we propose\nCA\nD\nGrasp\n, a two-stage algorithm for general dexterous grasping using single-view point cloud inputs. In the first stage, we predict sparse IBS, a scene-decoupled, contact- and collision-aware representation, as the optimization target. Sparse IBS compactly encodes the geometric and contact relationships between the dexterous hand and the scene, enabling stable and collision-free dexterous grasp pose optimization. To enhance the prediction of this high-dimensional representation, we introduce an occupancy-diffusion model with voxel-level conditional guidance and force closure score filtering. In the second stage, we develop several energy functions and ranking strategies for optimization based on sparse IBS to generate high-quality dexterous grasp poses. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world settings validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its capability to mitigate collisions while maintaining a high grasp success rate across diverse objects and complex scenes.

Compared to single-object dexterous grasping\nXu\net al.\n(\n2024\n); Lu\net al.\n(\n2024\n); Zhong\net al.\n(\n2025\n); Qin\net al.\n(\n2022\n); Wan\net al.\n(\n2023\n); Huang\net al.\n(\n2024\n); Singh\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\n, the diverse and complex layouts in cluttered scenes\nFang\net al.\n(\n2020\n,\n2023\n); Li\net al.\n(\n2022\n); Zhang\net al.\n(\n2024a\n); Chen\net al.\n(\n2025\n)\nintroduce additional challenges beyond generalizing to various objects. The stacking of objects leads to occlusion, resulting in partial observations without full object geometry. Moreover, the restricted graspability caused by stacking requires more precise grasp poses while avoiding collisions with surrounding objects to prevent unintended outcomes, such as target object displacement due to contact between the dexterous hand and nearby objects.\nCurrent methods focus on constructing large-scale synthetic datasets to capture the distribution of potential cluttered scenes\nLi\net al.\n(\n2022\n); Zhang\net al.\n(\n2024a\n)\n. Based on these datasets, existing approaches typically first filter scene points with high graspability. Conditioned on these points, they employ either regression-based\nLi\net al.\n(\n2022\n)\nor generative-based models\nZhang\net al.\n(\n2024a\n)\nto predict grasp poses. However, directly mapping partial point cloud observations to grasp poses is challenging to generalize due to the non-linearity of the mapping from 3D point cloud space to pose space and the sensitivity of physical constraints to small variations in hand pose\nLi\net al.\n(\n2023a\n)\n. Current methods\nJiang\net al.\n(\n2021\n); Xu\net al.\n(\n2023\n); Li\net al.\n(\n2023b\n,\na\n)\nadopt a two-stage framework that combines contact map prediction and optimization to enhance generalization. However, these methods are primarily designed for single-object grasping, assume access to complete object geometry for optimization, which is not available in real-world cluttered scenes due to partial observation.\nTo tackle this problem, we propose predicting a contact- and collision-aware intermediate representation to serve as the optimization target as shown in  Figure\n1\n. The proposed representation, sparse IBS, is the interaction bisector surface (IBS)\nKim\net al.\n(\n2006\n)\nbetween the scene and the dexterous hand, incorporating compact contact indicators. This representation is decoupled from the scene, eliminating the requirement for complete scene geometry, making it well-suited for cluttered scenes. Additionally, sparse IBS captures both geometric and contact information between the scene and the dexterous hand, making it effective for optimizing stable and collision-free dexterous grasp poses. To efficiently generate such a high-dimensional representation, we propose an occupancy-diffusion model with voxel-level conditional guidance and force closure score filtering. To further obtain stable and collision-free dexterous grasp poses, we design a set of energy functions tailored to sparse IBS.\nIn our experiments, we conduct extensive evaluations in simulation environments featuring 670 diverse cluttered scenes containing over 1300 objects. Comparative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, while ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our design. Our analysis highlights the stability and collision-awareness of the generated grasp poses. Additionally, we evaluate our method against other baselines in real-world settings to validate its practicality.\nIn summary, our contribution is as follows:\n•\nWe propose a two-stage framework consisting of scene-decoupled, contact- and collision-aware intermediate representation prediction and constrained grasp pose optimization for general dexterous grasping in cluttered scenes.\n•\nWe propose an occupancy-diffusion model with voxel-level conditional guidance and force closure score filtering to enhance representation prediction, along with several energy functions and ranking strategies to improve final grasp pose optimization.\n•\nWe conduct comprehensive simulation and real-world experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\nOne-stage Dexterous Grasp Pose Prediction\nOne-stage dexterous grasp pose generation\nXu\net al.\n(\n2024\n); Lu\net al.\n(\n2024\n); Zhong\net al.\n(\n2025\n); Huang\net al.\n(\n2023\n); Schmidt\net al.\n(\n2018\n); Liu\net al.\n(\n2019\n)\naims to train an end-to-end model to predict grasp poses. Regression-based methods\nSchmidt\net al.\n(\n2018\n); Liu\net al.\n(\n2019\n); Chen\net al.\n(\n2022\n)\nassume a one-to-one mapping between the object or scene and the grasp pose, which is limited in capturing the multi-modal dexterous grasp pose distribution due to the high degree of freedom. Generative-based methods\nHuang\net al.\n(\n2023\n); Lu\net al.\n(\n2024\n); Zhang\net al.\n(\n2023\n,\n2024b\n); Wu\net al.\n(\n2023\n)\ncan model complex distributions, making them more suitable for dexterous grasp pose generation. Current approaches leverage physical constraints\nZhong\net al.\n(\n2025\n); Lu\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\n, such as contact and penetration, to enhance grasp pose quality. However, end-to-end methods struggle with generalization due to the non-linearity between the observation space and pose space, as well as the sensitivity of physical constraints to small errors in grasp poses\nLi\net al.\n(\n2023a\n)\n. This challenge becomes more pronounced in cluttered environments, where the diversity of objects and layouts necessitates extremely large-scale grasp pose datasets\nLi\net al.\n(\n2022\n); Zhang\net al.\n(\n2024a\n)\n, limiting generalization. In contrast, we propose a two-stage framework that first predicts an intermediate representation in the observation space, followed by optimization based on this representation to enhance generalization.\n2.2\nTwo-stage Dexterous Grasp Pose Prediction\nTwo-stage dexterous grasp pose generation\nLi\net al.\n(\n2023b\n); Jiang\net al.\n(\n2021\n); Patzelt\net al.\n(\n2021\n); Lundell\net al.\n(\n2021a\n); Wei\net al.\n(\n2022\n); Mayer\net al.\n(\n2022\n)\ndecomposes grasp pose prediction into two stages to mitigate the challenges of direct mapping. Typically, the first stage predicts either the grasp pose\nPatzelt\net al.\n(\n2021\n); Lundell\net al.\n(\n2021a\n); Wei\net al.\n(\n2022\n); Lundell\net al.\n(\n2021b\n); Weng\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\nor an intermediate representation\nMayer\net al.\n(\n2022\n); Li\net al.\n(\n2023b\n); Jiang\net al.\n(\n2021\n)\n, followed by optimization based on physical constraints between the object and the dexterous hand. However, these methods are specifically designed for single-object grasping and assume prior knowledge of complete object geometries, which is often unavailable in cluttered scenes due to object stacking\nZhang\net al.\n(\n2024a\n); Li\net al.\n(\n2022\n)\n, even with multi-view cameras. This limitation restricts the applicability of two-stage methods in cluttered environments. In contrast, we propose a sparse IBS representation that serves as an intermediate representation, enabling the application of a two-stage framework in cluttered scenes.\n2.3\nHand-Object Representation\nHand-object representation can be primarily utilized in two ways. The first is to serve as the observation\nLiu\net al.\n(\n2023\n); She\net al.\n(\n2022\n); Mayer\net al.\n(\n2022\n); She\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\n, compressing the observation feature space and reducing the complexity of geometric feature learning, thereby enhancing grasp pose generation\nMayer\net al.\n(\n2022\n)\nor grasp policy learning\nLiu\net al.\n(\n2023\n); She\net al.\n(\n2022\n)\n. The second is to act as an intermediate representation for two-stage dexterous grasp pose generation methods\nJiang\net al.\n(\n2021\n); Li\net al.\n(\n2023b\n)\n.\nThe most common intermediate representation for two-stage grasp pose generation is the contact map\nLi\net al.\n(\n2023b\n); Xu\net al.\n(\n2023\n); Li\net al.\n(\n2023a\n)\n, which computes the distance between each point on the object and the dexterous hand. However, this representation requires complete object geometry, which is not accessible in cluttered scenes. The most relevant to our work is Interaction Bisector Surface (IBS)\nShe\net al.\n(\n2022\n)\n, which computes a surface between the scene and the dexterous hand along with various spatial and contact information. However, such representation has only been used as an observation representation\nShe\net al.\n(\n2022\n,\n2024\n)\n.\nIn contrast, we propose using IBS as an intermediate representation for grasp pose optimization. To reduce the difficulty of predicting such representation, we design a more compact sparse IBS representation and develop a specialized module to predict sparse IBS along with optimization strategies tailored to our sparse IBS representation.\n3\nMethod\nFigure 2:\nOverview of\nCA\nD\nGrasp\n, a two-stage framework for dexterous grasping in cluttered scenes.\n(I)\nConditional IBS Generation: A diffusion model is trained to model the conditional probability distribution\np\n​\n(\nℐ\n|\n𝒫\n,\n𝐓\n)\np(\\mathcal{I}|\\mathcal{P},\\mathbf{T})\n.\n(II)\nGrasp Pose Optimization: We optimize the grasp poses\n𝒢\n\\mathcal{G}\nwith predicted sparse IBS\nℐ\n^\n\\hat{\\mathcal{I}}\nas constraints.\nProblem Formulation.\nIn this work, we consider the problem of generating a set of grasp poses for a dexterous hand to grasp objects in a cluttered environment. We define a grasp pose of a dexterous hand as a tuple\n𝐠\n=\n{\n𝐓\n,\n𝐉\n}\n\\mathbf{g}=\\{\\mathbf{T},\\mathbf{J}\\}\n, where\n𝐓\n∈\nSE\n​\n(\n3\n)\n\\mathbf{T}\\in\\text{SE}(3)\nindicates the wrist pose,\n𝐉\n∈\nℝ\nn\n\\mathbf{J}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}\nis the joint configuration of the hand, and\nn\nn\nis the degree of freedom (DoF) of the hand. Given a single view pointcloud\n𝒫\n∈\nℝ\nN\n×\n3\n\\mathcal{P}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N\\times 3}\nof a cluttered scene, we estimate the grasp poses\n𝒢\n=\n{\n𝐠\ni\n}\ni\n=\n1\n|\n𝒢\n|\n\\mathcal{G}=\\{\\mathbf{g}_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{|\\mathcal{G}|}\nthat are stable and collision-free for dexterous grasping.\nOverview.\nThe overview of our method is shown in Figure\n2\n. We propose a two-stage framework for dexterous grasping in cluttered scenes, called\nCA\nD\nGrasp\n. We use the sparse IBS\nℐ\n\\mathcal{I}\nthat is aware of contact and collisions as an intermediate representation between the two stages, which can efficiently encode the geometric relationship between the dexterous hand and the scene corresponding to the successful grasp poses ( Section\n3.1\n). In the first stage, we model the conditional probability distribution\np\n​\n(\nℐ\n|\n𝒫\n,\n𝐓\n)\np(\\mathcal{I}|\\mathcal{P},\\mathbf{T})\nby a diffusion model, where\nℐ\n\\mathcal{I}\nis the sparse IBS,\n𝒫\n\\mathcal{P}\nis the single-view observed scene point cloud, and\n𝐓\n\\mathbf{T}\nis the wrist pose ( Section\n3.2\n). In the second stage, with the predicted sparse IBS\nℐ\n^\n\\hat{\\mathcal{I}}\nas constraints, we get dexterous grasp poses\n𝒢\n\\mathcal{G}\nvia an optimization algorithm ( Section\n3.3\n).\n3.1\nContact and Collision Aware IBS for Dexterous Grasping.\nIBS\nKim\net al.\n(\n2006\n)\nis the Voronoi diagram between two close 3D geometric objects. Inspired by the efficiency of IBS in describing the spatial relationship between 3D objects and its successful application in dexterous hand manipulation\nShe\net al.\n(\n2022\n,\n2024\n)\n, we adapt IBS to represent the geometric relationship between the dexterous hand and the environment as well as the object when a successful grasping state is achieved. We generate the sparse IBS\nℐ\n\\mathcal{I}\nin a simulator for training, as shown in Figure\n3\n. Specifically, for each dexterous grasp pose\n𝐠\n\\mathbf{g}\n, we define a canonical space centered at the grasp seed point\np\ns\np_{s}\nwith the rotation\n𝐑\n\\mathbf{R}\nof the wrist pose\n𝐓\n=\n[\n𝐑\n|\n𝐭\n]\n\\mathbf{T}=[\\mathbf{R}|\\mathbf{t}]\nas the direction. The sparse IBS\nℐ\n∈\nℝ\nn\n×\nn\n×\nn\n×\n3\n\\mathcal{I}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n\\times n\\times 3}\nis defined with a resolution of\nn\nn\n, where the last three dimensions are:\n•\nOccupancy of the IBS surface, which is 1 if the voxel in\nℐ\n\\mathcal{I}\nin IBS surface, otherwise it is\n−\n1\n-1\n.\n•\nOccupancy of contact points between the thumb and the target object, which is 1 if the voxel in\nℐ\n\\mathcal{I}\nis a contact point between the thumb and the object, otherwise it is\n−\n1\n-1\n.\n•\nOccupancy of contact points between other fingers and the object, which is 1 if the voxel in\nℐ\n\\mathcal{I}\nis a contact point between other fingers and the object, otherwise it is\n−\n1\n-1\n.\nThe sparse IBS\nℐ\n\\mathcal{I}\nencodes the geometric relationship between the hand corresponding to a successful grasp pose\n𝐠\n\\mathbf{g}\nand the environment, which includes not only the configuration of the hand but also the contact relationship between fingers and objects, and specifies a safety bound to ensure collision-free with environments.\nFigure 3:\nCreation of the sparse IBS for dexterous grasping.\nGiven a cluttered scene, we first generate the grasp pose\n𝐠\n\\mathbf{g}\nusing an optimization algorithm. Then, we canonicalize and crop the scene point cloud\n𝒫\n\\mathcal{P}\nto obtain the canonicalized point cloud\n𝒫\n∗\n\\mathcal{P}^{*}\n. Finally, we compute the sparse IBS\nℐ\n\\mathcal{I}\nbased on the canonicalized point cloud.\n3.2\nConditional IBS Generation.\nIn this section, our goal is to generate the intermediate representation IBS to provide constraints for the subsequent grasp pose optimization stage. Specifically, as shown in Figure\n2\n, given a single-view observed point cloud\n𝒫\n\\mathcal{P}\n, we first predict the wrist pose\n𝐓\n\\mathbf{T}\nof the dexterous hand. Then, given\n𝐓\n\\mathbf{T}\nand\n𝒫\n\\mathcal{P}\n, we generate multiple IBS candidates\n{\nℐ\ni\n}\ni\n=\n1\nn\n\\{\\mathcal{I}_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{n}\n, where\nn\nn\nis the number of candidates. Finally, we rank the IBS candidates and select the optimal one\nℐ\n^\n\\hat{\\mathcal{I}}\nas the final intermediate representation.\nWrist Pose Estimation.\nWe use the same structure as DexGraspNet2.0\nZhang\net al.\n(\n2024a\n)\n. First, given the scene point cloud\n𝒫\n∈\nℝ\nN\n×\n3\n\\mathcal{P}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N\\times 3}\n, where\nN\nN\nis the number of points, we extract point-wise features\nℱ\n=\n{\nf\ni\n}\ni\n=\n1\nN\n\\mathcal{F}=\\{f_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{N}\nusing ResUNet14\nChoy\net al.\n(\n2019\n)\nand predict point-wise graspness\n𝒮\n=\n{\ns\ni\n}\ni\n=\n1\nN\n\\mathcal{S}=\\{s_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{N}\n. Finally, after ranking and FPS sampling, we obtain the final set of grasp seed points\n{\np\ns\ni\n}\ni\n=\n1\nM\n\\{p_{s}^{i}\\}_{i=1}^{M}\n, where\nM\nM\nis the number of sampled points. For each grasp seed point\np\ns\np_{s}\n, we condition on the corresponding point feature\nf\nf\n, and use a denoising diffusion model\nZheng\net al.\n(\n2023\n)\nto directly model the joint probability distribution\np\n​\n(\n𝐓\n|\nf\n)\np(\\mathbf{T}|f)\nin Euclidean space and obtain the denoised wrist pose\n𝐓\n\\mathbf{T}\nwith reverse ODE process.\nFigure 4:\nIBS generation.\nWe train a conditional occupancy-diffusion model to model the conditional probability distribution\np\n​\n(\nℐ\n|\n𝒫\n∗\n)\np(\\mathcal{I}|\\mathcal{P}^{*})\n, where\n𝒫\n∗\n\\mathcal{P}^{*}\nis the canonicalized and voxelized point cloud. The voxel-level alignment provides hierarchical conditions during the denoising process.\nIBS Candidates Generation.\nAs shown in Figure\n4\n, given the selected grasp seed point\np\ns\np_{s}\nand the corresponding wrist pose\n𝐓\n\\mathbf{T}\n, we define a canonical space with\np\ns\np_{s}\nas the coordinate origin and the rotation of\n𝐓\n\\mathbf{T}\nas the direction. We canonicalize and voxelize the original observed point cloud\n𝒫\n\\mathcal{P}\nto obtain\n𝒫\n∗\n∈\nℝ\nn\n×\nn\n×\nn\n×\n1\n\\mathcal{P}^{*}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n\\times n\\times 1}\n, where\nn\nn\nis the voxelization resolution. The above operations simplify the modeling of the probability distribution\np\n​\n(\nℐ\n|\n𝒫\n,\n𝐓\n)\np(\\mathcal{I}|\\mathcal{P},\\mathbf{T})\nto modeling\np\n​\n(\nℐ\n|\n𝒫\n∗\n)\np(\\mathcal{I}|\\mathcal{P}^{*})\n, making the feature space more compact and reducing the training difficulty of the network. Specifically, inspired by the dominance of denoising diffusion models in 3D generation\nLuo and Hu (\n2021\n); Zheng\net al.\n(\n2023\n)\n, we model\np\n​\n(\nℐ\n|\n𝒫\n∗\n)\np(\\mathcal{I}|\\mathcal{P}^{*})\nbased on an occupancy-diffusion model\nZheng\net al.\n(\n2023\n)\n. The\nℐ\n∈\nℝ\nn\n×\nn\n×\nn\n×\n3\n\\mathcal{I}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n\\times n\\times 3}\nhas the same resolution as\n𝒫\n∗\n\\mathcal{P}^{*}\n, and this voxel-level alignment provides hierarchical conditions during the generation of IBS, improving both the generation quality and efficiency. As shown in Figure\n4\n, for both occupancy network\nΩ\no\n\\Omega_{o}\nand point cloud network\nΩ\np\n\\Omega_{p}\n, we use 3D UNet as the backbone network. UNet has 4 levels:\n40\n3\n40^{3}\n,\n20\n3\n20^{3}\n,\n10\n3\n10^{3}\n,\n5\n3\n5^{3}\n, with feature dimensions of\n32\n32\n,\n64\n64\n,\n128\n128\n, and\n256\n256\nrespectively at each level. We achieve voxel-level condition guidance by concatenating the point cloud features at corresponding levels to the occupancy features. The training of the diffusion network uses the following loss:\nℒ\nℐ\n0\n=\n𝔼\nϵ\n∼\n𝒩\n​\n(\n0\n,\nI\n)\n,\nt\n∼\n𝒰\n​\n(\n0\n,\n1\n)\n​\n‖\nΩ\no\n​\n(\nℐ\nt\n,\nt\n,\nΩ\np\n​\n(\n𝒫\n∗\n)\n)\n−\nℐ\n0\n‖\n2\n2\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathcal{I}_{0}}=\\mathbb{E}_{\\epsilon\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,I),t\\sim\\mathcal{U}(0,1)}\\left\\|\\Omega_{o}(\\mathcal{I}_{t},t,\\Omega_{p}(\\mathcal{P}^{*}))-\\mathcal{I}_{0}\\right\\|_{2}^{2}\n(1)\nwhere\nϵ\n\\epsilon\nand\nℐ\n0\n\\mathcal{I}_{0}\nare the data sample and\nℐ\nt\n\\mathcal{I}_{t}\nis the noisy sample at time step\nt\nt\n.\n𝒩\n\\mathcal{N}\nis the Gaussian distribution, and\n𝒰\n\\mathcal{U}\nis the uniform distribution.\nIBS Ranking.\nConsidering that the sampling process has a certain probability of sampling in low-density regions, we sample multiple IBS candidates\n{\nℐ\n^\ni\n}\ni\n=\n1\nm\n\\{\\hat{\\mathcal{I}}_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{m}\nfrom the estimated distribution\np\n​\n(\nℐ\n|\n𝒫\n∗\n)\np(\\mathcal{I}|\\mathcal{P}^{*})\n, where\nm\nm\nis the number of samples.

The object datasets consist of 60 training objects from GraspNet1Billion\n(Fang\net al.\n,\n2020\n)\nand 1259 testing objects from GraspNet1Billion and ShapeNet\n(Chang\net al.\n,\n2015\n)\n. We sample 100 scenes from the 7600 training scenes of DexGraspNet2\nZhang\net al.\n(\n2024a\n)\nfor the training of the IBS generation module. And we use the full 670 scenes from the testing set of DexGraspNet2\nZhang\net al.\n(\n2024a\n)\nfor the testing. The testing scenes are categorized into three density levels: loose, random, and dense.\nBaselines.\nWe compare our method with the following dexterous grasp pose prediction methods.\n•\nDexGraspNet2.0\nZhang\net al.\n(\n2024a\n)\n:\nAn end-to-end diffusion-based pipeline for grasp pose generation in cluttered scenes, directly mapping 3D point cloud observations to grasp poses.\n•\nHGC-Net\nLi\net al.\n(\n2022\n)\n:\nA regression-based model for direct pose prediction in cluttered scenes.\n•\nISAGrasp\nChen\net al.\n:\nThis baseline is originally designed for single-object grasping using an end-to-end regression-based model. Following the adaptation strategy in DexGraspNet2.0\nZhang\net al.\n(\n2024a\n)\n, we extend ISAGrasp to cluttered scenes.\n•\nGraspTTA\nJiang\net al.\n(\n2021\n)\n:\nA two-stage, single-object grasping framework that needs complete point clouds for the second-stage optimization, which is impractical in cluttered scenes; we therefore adapt it for cluttered scenes as DexGraspNet2.0 does and remove the optimization stage.\nThis two-stage framework is originally designed for single-object grasping and requires complete point clouds for second-stage optimization, which is not feasible in cluttered scenes. Therefore, following DexGraspNet2.0\nZhang\net al.\n(\n2024a\n)\n, we adapt GraspTTA for cluttered scenes and omit the optimization stage.\nEvaluation in Simulation.\nWe report the\nSuccess Rate\n, following the same evaluation protocol as DexGraspNet2.0\nZhang\net al.\n(\n2024a\n)\n. In the simulation, we evaluate from two perspectives:\n•\nObject and Scene Generalization.\nWe evaluate the performance of our method following the same protocol as DexGraspNet2.0\nZhang\net al.\n(\n2024a\n)\n.\n•\nCross-Embodiment Generalization.\nDifferent from other baselines, our method can directly zero-shot generalize to unseen embodiments, thanks to the proposed universal intermediate representation. We evaluate our method using an unseen dexterous hand (Allegro) in a zero-shot manner.\nReal-world Setup.\nAs shown in Figure\n5\n, we conduct real-world dexterous grasping experiments in clutter scenes, using a Flexiv Rizon-4 robot arm equipped with a Leap Hand\nShaw\net al.\nas the end-effector.\nFigure 5:\nReal-world experiment setup.\nA third-person view RealSense D415 camera is employed for perception. We selected 30 objects with diverse shapes, sizes, and materials, as depicted in Figure\n6\n. Following the simulation experiment setup, we also assess grasping under varying levels of clutter density, covering the entire object dataset across 5 cluttered scenes with 4 to 8 objects per scene, as illustrated in Figure\n6\n. For each scene, the policy continues grasping until two consecutive failures occur. For each grasp execution, we follow the same sequence as in the simulation: pre-grasp, grasp, squeeze fingers, and lift. We report the\nSuccess Rate\nas the number of successfully grasped objects divided by the total number of attempts.\nFigure 6:\nReal-world object datasets and evaluated cluttered scenes.\nThe left image shows the objects used in real-world testing.

We report only our method, trained on Leap Hand and tested on Allegro Hand, since other methods do not demonstrate cross-hand generalization.\n4.2\nSimulation Results\nComparison with Baselines.\nAs shown in Table\n1\n, the regression-based methods HGC-Net and ISAGrasp struggle with the complex dexterous grasp pose distribution. The generative-based method GraspTTA performs even worse, likely due to the absence of a second-stage optimization step. DexGraspNet2.0 achieves a higher success rate by leveraging the diffusion model. However, its direct end-to-end mapping is susceptible to challenges associated with non-linear mapping and sensitivity to physical constraints. In contrast, our two-stage approach demonstrates superior performance. Furthermore, to evaluate robustness, we report success rates with standard deviations over 20 random seeds. The consistently small deviations indicate stable performance across initializations.\nCross-Embodiment Generalization.\nSince our proposed sparse IBS representation is embodiment-agnostic, we directly use the same generated sparse IBS that was used to evaluate the Leap Hand to optimize the Allegro Hand grasp pose. As shown in Table\n1\n, the Allegro Hand also achieves comparable results to the Leap Hand, demonstrating the universality of our proposed representation.\n4.3\nReal-world Results\nAs shown in Table\n2\n, our method achieves an average grasp success rate of 93.3%, significantly surpassing the baseline at 83.9%. While the two methods exhibit comparable performance on medium-scale objects, our approach demonstrates markedly greater robustness for small and flat objects, in line with the simulation analyses reported in Table\n7\n. This improvement can be attributed to the effectiveness of the IBS. By integrating IBS into the optimization, our method explicitly avoids collisions with the table and surrounding objects, yielding safer grasps, which is particularly critical in densely cluttered scenes. The observed real-world performance underscores the practical applicability of our approach for deployment in real robotic systems.\nMethod\nScene #1\nScene #2\nScene #3\nScene #4\nScene #5\nOverall\nDexGraspNet2.0\nZhang\net al.\n(\n2024a\n)\n100.0% (4/4)\n50.0% (2/4)\n71.4% 5/7)\n100.0% (7/7)\n88.9% (8/9)\n83.9% (26/31)\nCADGrasp (Ours)\n100.0% (4/4)\n100.0% (5/5)\n85.7% (6/7)\n100% (7/7)\n88.9% (8/9)\n93.8% (30/32)\nTable 2:\nReal-world results.\nWe evaluated 30 objects across 5 real-world cluttered scenes.

A detailed breakdown of the runtime is reported in Table\n3\n. The end-to-end time to generate a single grasp is 6.51 s on average, measured without any task-specific engineering optimizations. While not real-time, our method delivers a substantial latency advantage over existing state-of-the-art two-stage approaches (see Table\n4\n). We anticipate that real-time feasibility can be pushed closer to real-time by adopting faster samplers\nSalimans and Ho (\n2022\n); Song\net al.\n(\n2023\n)\nand by increasing parallelism in the optimization stage.\nMethod\nIntermediate Rep.\nPartial Obs.\nCluttered\nRuntime (s)\nGraspTTA\nContact Map\n×\n\\times\n×\n\\times\n43.23\nUniGrasp\n3 Contact Points\n×\n\\times\n×\n\\times\n9.33\nGenDexGrasp\nContact Map\n×\n\\times\n×\n\\times\n16.42\nCADGrasp (Ours)\nSparse IBS\n✓\n✓\n6.51\nTable 4:\nRuntime and capability comparison with representative two-stage methods.\nOur approach is faster and enables dexterous grasping under partial observations in cluttered scenes, both of which are essential for real-world deployment.\n4.5\nAblation Study.\nWe conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the dense scenes of GraspNet-1Billion test set to validate our design choices.\n•\nModule Interaction.\nWe first analyze the interaction effects between key modules in Table\n5\n. The results show that removing any component leads to a performance drop, with the full model achieving the best success rate 86.5%. Notably, decomposing the contact representation (‘Decompose’) for the thumb and other fingers provides a substantial improvement (e.g., 86.5% vs. 56.1% without it). This confirms the critical role of the thumb in dexterous grasping\nFeix\net al.\n(\n2015\n)\nand validates our design to model it separately.

We select a voxel size of 5mm to balance accuracy and efficiency. Finer resolutions (2.5mm) offer only marginal gains while significantly increasing memory usage, whereas coarser resolutions (10mm) lead to a clear performance drop.\n•\nObject Size.\nFinally, we analyze the performance on objects of different sizes in Table\n7\n. The results indicate that the success rate for small objects is indeed lower. However, combined with the findings in Table\n6\n, we attribute this to the inherently higher precision required for grasping small objects, rather than insufficient voxel resolution.\nVoxel Size (mm)\nMemory (GB)\nSR (%)\n2.5\n2.12\n81.2\n5\n0.84\n81.0\n10\n0.36\n72.4\nTable 6:\nAblation on voxel resolution.\nBolded items denote selected hyperparameters, balancing computational efficiency and performance.\nVolume Range (m³)\nSR (%)\nProp.

The first stage predicts our proposed compact, scene-decoupled, contact- and collision-aware intermediate representation, which serves as the target for the second-stage optimization. To ensure the quality of the predicted representation, we introduce an occupancy-diffusion model with voxel-level conditional guidance and force closure filtering. To generate stable and collision-free grasp poses, we further propose several energy functions and ranking strategies for pose optimization. Comprehensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.\nLimitations.\nAlthough our method demonstrates better generalization, it primarily struggles with small objects, which could be addressed by incorporating more small objects during training. Additionally, the current second-stage optimization is time-consuming due to the use of the DDPM\nHo\net al.\n(\n2020\n)\nfor sampling IBS. This can be further optimized by adopting the DDIM\nSong\net al.\n.\nAcknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\nThis work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China - General Program (Project ID: 62376006), National Youth Talent Support Program (Project ID: 8200800081).\nReferences\nA.

We use the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of\n6\n​\ne\n−\n5\n6e^{-5}\nand trained the model for 130 epochs. The training procedure takes about 2 days.\nA.2\nHyperparameters\nThe hyperparameters employed in our experiments are detailed in Table\n8\n. The size of IBS volume is configured to\n0.2\n​\nm\n×\n0.2\n​\nm\n×\n0.2\n​\nm\n0.2\\,\\text{m}\\times 0.2\\,\\text{m}\\times 0.2\\,\\text{m}\n, adequately encompassing the interaction space between the dexterous hand and the object, while remaining sufficiently compact to focus on the critical local grasping region. The resolution of the IBS volume is set to\n40\n×\n40\n×\n40\n40\\times 40\\times 40\n, striking a balance between computational efficiency and the accuracy of the IBS surface representation. Both the IBS sampling and grasp pose optimization processes are executed concurrently, with the number of IBS candidates and grasp poses each limited to 5. The weights in the contact energy\n𝐄\nd\n\\mathbf{E}_{d}\nare meticulously adjusted to balance the contacts between the object and the thumb, as well as the other fingers, whereas the weights in the overall energy\n𝐄\n\\mathbf{E}\nare calibrated to harmonize the various energy terms. The hyperparameter for denoising timesteps is adopted from\n[\n43\n]\n.\nHyperparameter\nValue\nIBS Volume Size\n0.2\n​\nm\n×\n0.2\n​\nm\n×\n0.2\n​\nm\n0.2m\\times 0.2m\\times 0.2m\nIBS Resolution (\nn\nn\n)\n40\n×\n40\n×\n40\n40\\times 40\\times 40\nNumber of IBS Candidates (\nm\nm\n)\n5\nNumber of Grasp Poses (\nk\nk\n)\n5\nWeights in Contact Energy\n𝐄\nd\n\\mathbf{E}_{d}\n(\nα\n1\n,\nα\n2\n,\nα\n3\n\\alpha_{1},\\alpha_{2},\\alpha_{3}\n)\n80, 100, 2\nWeights in Overall Energy\n𝐄\n\\mathbf{E}\n(\nλ\n1\n,\nλ\n2\n,\nλ\n3\n,\nλ\n4\n\\lambda_{1},\\lambda_{2},\\lambda_{3},\\lambda_{4}\n)\n5, 1, 1000, 1\nDenoising Timesteps\n50\nTable 8:\nHyperparameters used in our experiments.\nB\nMore Results\nIn this section, we provide additional results of our method to demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, scalability, and generalization ability of our method.\nB.1\nQualitative Results\nIn this section, we present additional qualitative evaluations of our proposed method. Figure\n7\nshowcases the perception results of our method in both simulated and real-world environments. The results clearly demonstrate that our approach successfully discerns the sparse IBS volume pertinent to a success grasp pose from a single-view point cloud in cluttered settings. It effectively differentiates the contact regions of the thumb and other fingers with the object. Furthermore, the second-stage optimization, guided by Sparse IBS constraints, adaptly refines collision-free and plausible grasp poses. Notably, the adoption of point cloud representation minimizes the sim-to-real gap, ensuring that our method can generalize to real-world settings without additional training, thereby achieving robust dexterous grasping capabilities.\nFigure 7:\nQualitative results of our method in simulated (upper panel) and real-world environments (lower panel). From left to right: the initial single-view point cloud input, the sparse IBS prediction from the initial stage, and the optimized grasp pose from the subsequent stage. The purple areas indicate thumb contact, red areas denote contact by other fingers, and green areas represent non-contact regions on the IBS surface.\nB.2\nGrasp Diversity Analysis\nWe analyze the distribution of joint configurations for all predicted grasp poses by\nCA\nD\nGrasp\nand DexGraspNet2.0\n[\n40\n]\nwithin the GraspNet-1B loose scenarios\n[\n40\n]\n. This analysis aimed to compare the diversity of grasp poses generated by the two methods. Taking the thumb as an example,  Figure\n8\nillustrates that our method can generate diverse grasps with significantly higher dexterity compared to DexGraspNet2.0. This highlights our approach’s capability to produce a wider range of effective grasp configurations, enhancing its applicability in complex scenarios.\nFigure 8:\nGrasp diversity analysis of\nCA\nD\nGrasp\nand DexGraspNet2.0 within the GraspNet-1B loose scenarios. The histogram illustrates the distribution of joint configurations for the thumb.\nFigure 9:\nPenetration depth analysis of predicted grasp poses by\nCA\nD\nGrasp\nand DexGraspNet2.0 within the GraspNet-1B loose scenarios. The histogram illustrates the distribution of maximal penetration depths.\nB.3\nGrasp Quality Analysis\nIn evaluating grasp quality, the proximity and penetration between the predicted grasp pose and the object serve as crucial indicators. We analyzed the maximal penetration depth (in cm) of all predicted grasp poses by\nCA\nD\nGrasp\nand DexGraspNet2.0 within the GraspNet-1B loose scenarios. This metric is defined as the maximal penetration depth from the object point cloud to the hand meshes. As illustrated in  Figure\n9\n, our method demonstrates a concentration of penetration depths near the object’s surface (penetration depth = 0), attributed to the constraints imposed by the IBS Surface and contact points. This further underscores the superiority of our approach in achieving precise and effective grasping.",
    "preview_text": "Dexterous grasping in cluttered environments presents substantial challenges due to the high degrees of freedom of dexterous hands, occlusion, and potential collisions arising from diverse object geometries and complex layouts. To address these challenges, we propose CADGrasp, a two-stage algorithm for general dexterous grasping using single-view point cloud inputs. In the first stage, we predict sparse IBS, a scene-decoupled, contact- and collision-aware representation, as the optimization target. Sparse IBS compactly encodes the geometric and contact relationships between the dexterous hand and the scene, enabling stable and collision-free dexterous grasp pose optimization. To enhance the prediction of this high-dimensional representation, we introduce an occupancy-diffusion model with voxel-level conditional guidance and force closure score filtering. In the second stage, we develop several energy functions and ranking strategies for optimization based on sparse IBS to generate high-quality dexterous grasp poses. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world settings validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its capability to mitigate collisions while maintaining a high grasp success rate across diverse objects and complex scenes.\n\nCA\nD\nGrasp\n: Learning\nC\nontact and\nC\nollision\nA\nware General\nD\nexterous\nGrasp\ning in Cluttered Scenes\nJiyao Zhang\n1,2 *\n, Zhiyuan Ma\n1,2 *\n, Tianhao Wu\n1,2\n, Zeyuan Chen\n1,2\n, Hao Dong\n1,2\n†\n\\dagger\n1\nCenter on Frontiers of Computing Studies, School of Computer Science, Peking University\n2\nNational Key Laboratory for Multimedia Information Processing,\nSchool of Computer Science, Peking University\njiyaozhang@stu.pku.edu.cn\nAbstract\nDexterous grasping in cluttered environments presents substantial challenges due to the high degrees of freedom of dexterous hands, occlusion, and potential collisions arising from diverse object geometries and complex layouts.

            "answer": "## CADGrasp 论文分析\n\n### **核心问题**\n论文旨在解决**杂乱场景中灵巧手抓取**的关键挑战：\n1.  **高自由度**：灵巧手（如Leap Hand）关节多，姿态空间巨大。\n2.  **遮挡与部分观测**：物体堆叠导致单视角点云无法提供完整几何信息。\n3.  **碰撞风险**：复杂布局中，手部极易与目标物体及周围环境发生碰撞，导致抓取失败或场景扰动。\n\n现有方法（如端到端回归或生成模型）直接映射点云到抓取姿态，由于**观测空间与姿态空间之间的非线性映射**以及**物理约束对微小误差的敏感性**，在杂乱场景中泛化能力不足。传统的两阶段方法又依赖完整的物体几何信息进行优化，这在部分观测的杂乱场景中不适用。\n\n### **核心创新点**\n论文提出了一个名为 **CADGrasp** 的两阶段框架，其核心创新在于引入了一种**场景解耦、接触与碰撞感知的中间表示**，并围绕其构建了完整的预测与优化流程。\n\n#### **1. 创新的中间表示：稀疏交互等分面**\n- **是什么**：**稀疏IBS** 是灵巧手与场景之间**交互等分面**的紧凑表示。它在以抓取种子点为中心的规范空间内，以体素网格形式编码三类信息：\n    1.  IBS表面占据（几何关系）。\n    2.  拇指与目标物体的接触点。\n    3.  其他手指与目标物体的接触点。\n- **为什么创新**：\n    - **场景解耦**：该表示基于规范化的局部空间，**不依赖于完整的场景几何**，完美适配单视角部分观测的杂乱场景。\n    - **物理信息丰富**：同时编码了**几何临近性**（IBS表面定义了安全边界）和**关键接触信息**（区分拇指/其他手指），为后续优化提供了明确、全面的物理约束目标。\n\n#### **2. 创新的两阶段框架**\n**第一阶段：条件化IBS生成**\n- **方法**：使用一个**占用扩散模型**来学习给定规范化场景点云时，稀疏IBS的条件概率分布 `p(ℐ|𝒫*)`。\n- **技术创新**：\n    - **体素级条件引导**：将点云特征与扩散模型的UNet特征在对应层级拼接，实现细粒度条件生成，提升预测质量。\n    - **力闭合分数过滤**：对扩散模型采样生成的多个IBS候选，根据其接触点计算力闭合分数进行排序，选择最优的作为中间表示。\n\n**第二阶段：基于IBS约束的抓取姿态优化**\n- **方法**：以预测的稀疏IBS `ℐ̂` 为约束目标，通过最小化一个组合能量函数来优化灵巧手的关节姿态。\n- **技术创新**：\n    - **量身定制的能量函数**：设计了四项能量项，均与IBS表示紧密关联：\n        - `𝐄_j`：关节限位。\n        - `𝐄_sp`：手部自穿透惩罚。\n        - `𝐄_p`：**碰撞能量**。约束手部点云位于IBS表面“正确”的一侧（即物体外部），利用IBS法向量确保无碰撞。\n        - `𝐄_d`：**接触能量**。吸引手指（特别是拇指和其他手指分别处理）向IBS中预测的对应接触点靠近，实现稳定接触。\n    - **优化结果排序**：进行多次优化尝试，根据最终能量残差对生成的抓取姿态进行排序，选择最优解。\n\n### **解决方案总结**\n论文通过 **“预测中间表示 -> 基于表示优化”** 的范式，将复杂的抓取姿态生成问题分解：\n1.  **降低映射难度**：第一阶段在观测空间（点云）到表示空间（IBS）之间学习映射，比直接映射到高维姿态空间更简单、更稳定。\n2.  **注入物理约束**：稀疏IBS本身蕴含了接触与碰撞的物理信息。第二阶段优化将这些信息转化为明确的能量项，**显式地**引导生成**稳定且无碰撞**的抓取姿态。\n3.  **提升泛化能力**：中间表示的场景解耦特性使其对遮挡鲁棒；两阶段设计减少了对海量抓取姿态数据分布的依赖，提高了对未见物体和场景的泛化能力。实验还证明了该表示支持**零样本跨灵巧手泛化**（如从Leap Hand到Allegro Hand）。\n\n### **实际价值**\n- **性能提升**：在模拟和真实世界实验中，CADGrasp在杂乱场景下的抓取成功率显著优于现有端到端基线（如DexGraspNet2.0）。\n- **安全性增强**：通过IBS显式建模碰撞边界，生成的抓取姿态能有效避免与场景中其他物体及桌面的碰撞，这对于实际机器人部署至关重要。\n- **通用性**：框架不依赖于特定手部模型，中间表示的通用性为不同灵巧手之间的抓取策略迁移提供了可能。\n- **实用性**：尽管非实时（~6.5秒/抓取），但其推理速度已优于许多现有两阶段方法，且通过工程优化有进一步提升潜力。",

            "answer": "## 论文分析：CADGrasp及其在灵巧抓取领域的发展脉络\n\n基于对论文《CADGrasp: Learning Contact and Collision Aware General Dexterous Grasping in Cluttered Scenes》的分析，我们可以梳理出灵巧手在杂乱场景中抓取这一方向的发展脉络。其核心挑战在于**高自由度、遮挡和碰撞**。发展主线可以清晰地分为几个阶段和不同的技术方向。\n\n### 发展脉络总览\n\n该领域的发展呈现出从**简单到复杂**（单物体 -> 杂乱场景）、从**直接映射到分阶段优化**、从**依赖完整几何到适应部分观测**的演进趋势。CADGrasp是这一脉络下的最新进展，它综合了多个方向的优点。\n\n以下是基于论文内容梳理的关键发展阶段和改进：\n\n### 方向一：从单物体抓取到杂乱场景抓取\n\n这是应用场景的根本性拓展，带来了全新的挑战。\n\n*   **早期工作（单物体抓取）:**\n    *   **代表方法:** GraspTTA, GenDexGrasp, Contact2Grasp 等。\n    *   **特点与局限:** 这些方法通常假设可以获得**完整的物体几何模型**，并在此基础上进行接触图预测和抓取位姿优化。它们的能量函数和优化策略严重依赖完整的物体表面信息。**在杂乱场景中，由于物体堆叠和遮挡，无法获得完整观测，因此这些方法无法直接应用。**\n\n*   **改进工作（适应杂乱场景）:**\n    *   **代表方法:** DexGraspNet 2.0, HGC-Net。\n    *   **核心改进:** 开始使用**单视角点云**作为输入，并构建大规模合成数据集来模拟杂乱场景的分布。\n    *   **技术路径:** 主要采用**端到端**的范式，直接从观测点云回归或生成抓取位姿。\n    *   **遗留问题:** 端到端映射由于从观测空间到高维位姿空间的**非线性**以及抓取对物理约束的**敏感性**，泛化能力有限。生成的结果在碰撞避免和稳定性上仍有不足。\n\n*   **CADGrasp的贡献:**\n    *   **关键创新:** 提出了一个**与场景解耦的中间表示**——稀疏IBS。\n    *   **如何解决遗留问题:**\n        1.  **解耦性:** 稀疏IBS的生成不依赖于完整的场景几何，只与手和物体的**局部交互区域**相关，完美适配单视角部分观测。\n        2.  **信息丰富性:** 该表示同时编码了**几何关系**（IBS表面，定义安全边界）、**接触信息**（拇指/其他手指接触点），天然地引导生成**稳定且无碰撞**的抓取。\n        3.  **两阶段框架:** 将困难的“观测->位姿”映射，分解为“观测->中间表示”和“表示->位姿优化”两个相对更容易的子问题，提升了泛化能力。\n\n### 方向二：从端到端预测到两阶段优化\n\n这是方法学框架的演进，旨在提升抓取的质量和泛化性。\n\n*   **端到端方法:**\n    *   **代表方法:** 回归方法（HGC-Net），生成方法（DexGraspNet 2.0, UGG）。\n    *   **特点:** 追求简洁，一步输出抓取位姿。生成式方法（尤其是扩散模型）能更好地建模抓取位姿的多模态分布。\n    *   **局限:** 如前述，对数据集规模和质量依赖极高，且难以精确满足复杂的物理约束（如精确接触、零碰撞），导致在仿真中表现尚可，但**sim-to-real**差距大，实际成功率受限。\n\n*   **两阶段方法（早期，针对单物体）:**\n    *   **代表方法:** GraspTTA, GenDexGrasp。\n    *   **核心改进:** 第一阶段预测**接触图**等中间表示，第二阶段基于**完整的物体网格**进行物理优化。这显著提升了抓取的物理合理性和质量。\n    *   **局限:** 严重依赖**完整物体几何**，无法用于杂乱场景。\n\n*   **CADGrasp的贡献:**\n    *   **关键创新:** 将两阶段框架**成功引入杂乱场景**。\n    *   **如何实现:**\n        1.  **设计了适用于杂乱场景的中间表示（稀疏IBS）**，替代了需要完整几何的接触图。\n        2.  **开发了基于扩散模型的预测器**，用于从部分点云生成高质量的稀疏IBS。\n        3.  **设计了一套针对稀疏IBS的专用能量函数**（`E_p`用于接触约束，`E_d`用于距离约束），将IBS蕴含的几何和接触信息转化为可优化的目标，从而得到高质量抓取位姿。\n\n### 方向三：中间表示的演进\n\n这是提升两阶段方法效能的核心。\n\n*   **接触图:**\n    *   **用途:** 描述手上每个点与物体表面的距离，是单物体抓取中常用的中间表示。\n    *   **局限:** 计算和优化都需要完整的物体表面，**无法处理遮挡**。\n\n*   **交互平分曲面（IBS）作为观测表示:**\n    *   **代表工作:** She et al. 等人的工作。\n    *   **用途:** 将IBS用作**观测的压缩表示**，输入给策略网络，以降低学习复杂度。\n    *   **局限:** 尚未作为**优化目标**使用。\n\n*   **CADGrasp的贡献:**\n    *   **关键创新:** 首次将IBS改造并用作**抓取位姿优化的中间表示和目标**。\n    *   **具体改造:**\n        1.  **稀疏化与结构化:** 将IBS体素化，并在每个体素中编码三类信息：IBS表面、拇指接触点、其他手指接触点。这使得表示更紧凑且信息明确。\n        2.  **解耦与规范化:** 以抓取种子点和手腕朝向定义规范空间，使表示与场景全局布局解耦，只关注局部交互，增强了泛化性。\n        3.  **预测与优化闭环:** 不仅预测它，还专门设计了与之匹配的优化能量函数，形成了完整的“预测-优化”回路。\n\n### 方向四：跨灵巧手泛化\n\n这是一个具有重要实用价值的方向。\n\n*   **先前工作的局限:** 绝大多数方法都是**手型特定**的。为一种灵巧手（如Leap Hand）训练的策略或生成器，无法直接用于另一种手（如Allegro Hand）。需要重新收集数据、训练模型，成本高昂。\n\n*   **CADGrasp的贡献:**\n    *   **关键创新:** 利用中间表示的** embodiment-agnostic **（与具体手型无关）特性，实现了零样本跨手型泛化。\n    *   **如何实现:** 稀疏IBS描述的是“手与物体/场景之间应有的交互状态”，而不限定是哪只手。只要第二阶段优化时，将能量函数中的手部点云 `P_h` 替换为新手的模型，就能用**同一个预测的稀疏IBS**来优化出新手的抓取位姿。\n    *   **实验验证:** 论文展示了在Leap Hand上训练，无需微调即可为Allegro Hand生成成功抓取，证明了该表示的通用性。\n\n### 总结\n\nCADGrasp的工作是站在前作肩膀上的系统性创新：\n1.  **场景上**，继承了DexGraspNet 2.0对杂乱场景的关注。\n2.  **框架上**，采用了GraspTTA等两阶段优化的思想，但**革命性地替换了核心中间表示**，使其适应部分观测。\n3.  **表示上**，借鉴了IBS的概念，但将其从观测工具提升为**优化目标**，并进行了面向抓取任务的结构化设计。\n4.  **泛化上**，利用中间表示的抽象性，开辟了**零样本跨手型泛化**的新能力。\n\n因此，CADGrasp的发展脉络可以概括为：**为了解决端到端方法在杂乱场景中泛化不足和物理约束难以满足的问题，它创造性地引入了一个与场景解耦、富含物理信息的中间表示（稀疏IBS），从而将成熟的两阶段优化框架成功应用于杂乱场景，并意外地获得了跨手型泛化的强大能力。** 这标志着该领域从追求直接生成，转向追求**可解释、可约束、可泛化**的抓取生成。",

            "answer": "## CADGrasp 的前作分析\n\n根据论文内容，CADGrasp 的研究团队（特别是作者 Zhang 等人）在灵巧抓取领域有一系列重要的前期工作。这些工作主要集中在构建大规模合成数据集和开发端到端的生成模型。以下是其核心前作的详细梳理：\n\n### 前作总结表格\n\n| 论文名称 | 发表年份/会议 | 核心贡献 | 与 CADGrasp 的关键区别 | CADGrasp 的主要改善 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **DexGraspNet 2.0** <br> (Zhang et al., 2024a) | 2024 (CoRL) | 1. **大规模合成数据集**：为杂乱场景中的灵巧抓取构建了包含7600个训练场景和670个测试场景的数据集。<br>2. **端到端扩散模型**：直接使用扩散模型从单视角点云回归抓取姿态（手腕位姿+关节角）。<br>3. **生成式方法**：能够建模抓取姿态的多模态分布。 | 1. **单阶段、端到端**：直接映射点云到抓取姿态，没有中间表示或优化阶段。<br>2. **依赖完整数据分布**：泛化能力受限于大规模数据，对物理约束（如接触、碰撞）的小误差敏感。<br>3. **未显式处理碰撞**：在密集杂乱场景中，碰撞避免能力有限。 | 1. **引入两阶段框架**：将困难的非线性映射问题分解为**中间表示预测**和**基于约束的优化**两个更易处理的阶段，提升了泛化能力。<br>2. **提出场景解耦的中间表示（稀疏IBS）**：不再需要完整物体几何，适用于部分观测的杂乱场景，并显式编码了接触和碰撞信息。<br>3. **显式优化碰撞避免**：通过基于稀疏IBS设计的能量函数（如碰撞能量 `E_p`），在优化阶段主动避免与场景中其他物体的碰撞。 |\n| **（更早的）大规模数据集构建工作** <br> (Li et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2024a 的奠基) | 2022 (ICRA) 等 | 1. **开创性数据**：证明了在杂乱场景中训练灵巧抓取模型需要构建超大规模、多样化的合成数据集（如HGC-Net）。<br>2. **回归或生成基线**：为后续研究（如DexGraspNet 2.0）提供了数据基础和基线方法。 | 1. **方法局限**：回归方法难以捕捉高自由度抓取的多模态分布；早期生成方法效果不佳。<br>2. **场景耦合**：模型学习与特定场景布局紧密耦合，泛化到新物体和新布局困难。 | 1. **方法创新**：CADGrasp 没有停留在“用更大数据训练更好模型”的路径上，而是通过**算法框架创新**（两阶段+中间表示）来从根本上提升在杂乱场景中的泛化能力和安全性。<br>2. **表示创新**：提出的稀疏IBS是一种**与场景解耦**的表示，其预测不依赖于完整的场景几何，因此对遮挡和部分观测更具鲁棒性。 |\n\n### 核心区别与主要改善的深入分析\n\nCADGrasp 相对于其前作（尤其是直接的“升级版” DexGraspNet 2.0）的改进是系统性和根本性的：\n\n1.  **从“端到端黑箱”到“可解释的分解式框架”**\n    *   **前作 (DexGraspNet 2.0)**：像一个复杂的函数，直接学习从点云 `P` 到抓取姿态 `G` 的映射 `f: P -> G`。这个映射高度非线性，且物理约束（如“手指应该接触这里而不碰那里”）是隐式地在损失函数中学习的，模型对其预测中的微小误差非常敏感。\n    *   **CADGrasp**：将问题分解为 `P -> I -> G`，其中 `I` 是稀疏IBS。\n        *   **第一阶段 (`P -> I`)**：学习预测一个**物理意义明确**的中间表示。稀疏IBS本质上定义了手与物体/环境之间理想的**几何关系边界**（接触点在哪里，安全区域是什么）。这个任务在3D观察空间内，比直接映射到高维姿态空间更简单。\n        *   **第二阶段 (`I -> G`)**：基于明确的物理约束（由IBS定义）进行优化。这是一个**基于模型**的过程，通过最小化能量函数来寻找满足IBS约束的手部姿态。这提升了对未知物体和布局的泛化能力，因为优化准则（IBS）是通用的，而非从数据中记忆的特定姿态。\n\n2.  **从“隐式碰撞处理”到“显式碰撞感知”**\n    *   **前作**：碰撞避免依赖于训练数据中负样本（碰撞姿态）的分布，是数据驱动的、隐式的。在训练未充分覆盖的极端密集场景中，容易失败。\n    *   **CADGrasp**：稀疏IBS的**非接触表面**部分，明确地划定了手部与周围环境之间的**安全缓冲区**。在优化阶段，`E_p` 能量项强制手部表面点停留在IBS表面之外或之上，从而**显式地**避免了穿透和碰撞。这是其在实际杂乱场景中成功率更高、特别是对小/扁平物体抓取更鲁棒的关键。\n\n3.  **从“特定手型”到“跨灵巧手泛化”**\n    *   **前作**：模型通常针对特定手型（如Leap Hand）进行训练，换一个手型（如Allegro Hand）需要重新收集数据和训练。\n    *   **CADGrasp**：稀疏IBS是一种**与具体手型无关**的表示，它描述的是**期望的交互几何关系**。在第二阶段，只需为新的手型重新计算其与预测IBS之间的能量函数，即可进行零样本优化。论文中在Allegro Hand上的成功实验验证了这一点，这是前作无法实现的。\n\n**总结**：CADGrasp 的核心进步在于，它通过引入一个**接触与碰撞感知的、场景解耦的中间表示（稀疏IBS）**，将灵巧抓取问题从一个困难的数据驱动回归/生成问题，转变为一个更可控的“**表示预测 + 基于物理的约束优化**”问题。这不仅提高了在杂乱场景下的成功率和安全性，还带来了更好的可解释性和跨手型的泛化能力。",

            "question": "论文的主要局限性有哪些？未来可能的改进方向是什么？",
            "answer": "## 论文主要局限性分析\n\n根据论文第5节（Conclusion）和实验部分（Section 4.5）的讨论，**CADGrasp** 方法存在以下主要局限性：\n\n- **对小物体抓取的性能相对较低**\n    - 如表7所示，对于体积小于 `0.00025 m³` 的小物体，抓取成功率（77.0%）明显低于大物体（如大于 `0.0015 m³` 的物体成功率为91.5%）。\n    - **原因分析**：作者认为小物体抓取本身需要更高的精度，而非体素分辨率不足（表6显示将分辨率从5mm提升至2.5mm对性能提升有限）。\n\n- **第二阶段优化过程耗时较长**\n    - 如表3所示，完整的抓取生成流程平均需要 **6.51秒**，其中抓取姿态优化（Grasp Opt. & Rk.）阶段占 **3.03秒**。\n    - **原因分析**：当前使用DDPM进行稀疏IBS采样和基于梯度的优化计算成本较高，限制了实时性。\n\n- **训练数据对小物体的覆盖可能不足**\n    - 作者在局限性中指出，性能瓶颈可能源于训练数据集中**小物体样本相对较少**，导致模型对小物体几何和接触模式的学习不充分。\n\n## 未来可能的改进方向\n\n基于上述局限性，论文暗示或可推导出以下改进方向：\n\n- **增强对小物体抓取的能力**\n    - **数据层面**：在训练数据集中**增加更多小物体的样本**，覆盖更广泛的尺寸和几何形状，以提升模型对小尺度特征的感知和泛化能力。\n    - **表示层面**：探索**自适应或多尺度体素化**策略，对小物体区域使用更高分辨率的表示，而对大物体区域保持较低分辨率，以平衡精度与计算效率。\n\n- **提升算法运行效率**\n    - **采样加速**：采用更快的扩散模型采样器，如 **DDIM**、**一致性模型（Consistency Models）** 或**渐进蒸馏（Progressive Distillation）**（论文4.4节提及），以大幅减少第一阶段IBS生成的时间。\n    - **优化加速**：**并行化**第二阶段的多组抓取姿态优化过程，或研究更轻量级的优化算法，减少单次优化耗时。\n\n- **拓展与泛化**\n    - **动态与非刚性物体**：当前方法专注于静态杂乱场景。未来可研究如何将 **稀疏IBS表示与动态预测或非刚性物体建模** 结合，处理物体移动或变形的场景。\n    - **更复杂的任务链**：将抓取生成作为 **长时序操作任务（如重新摆放、工具使用）** 的子模块，研究基于IBS表示的序列决策规划。\n\n- **技术融合与框架优化**\n    - **闭环与在线修正**：结合**实时感知（如触觉反馈）**，在优化阶段或执行阶段对预测的IBS和抓取姿态进行在线调整，应对感知误差和场景不确定性。\n    - **统一生成与优化**：探索**端到端可微分的优化层**，将第二阶段的部分约束优化过程嵌入到神经网络中，实现更高效的单阶段推理，同时保持两阶段框架的泛化优势。\n\n**总结**：CADGrasp的核心创新在于引入了**场景解耦、接触与碰撞感知的稀疏IBS表示**，有效解决了杂乱场景中灵巧抓取的泛化与碰撞避免难题。其局限性主要围绕**小物体精度**和**计算效率**，未来的改进将集中于**数据扩充**、**算法加速**以及向**更复杂、动态的任务场景**拓展。",
