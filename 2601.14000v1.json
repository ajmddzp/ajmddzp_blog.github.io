However, existing approaches often ignore the geometric symmetries of physical environments, leading to redundant behaviors and sample inefficiency. To address this, we introduce Group-Invariant Skill Discovery (GISD), a framework that explicitly embeds group structure into the skill discovery objective. Our approach is grounded in a theoretical guarantee: we prove that in group-symmetric environments, the standard Wasserstein dependency measure admits a globally optimal solution comprised of an equivariant policy and a group-invariant scoring function. Motivated by this, we formulate the Group-Invariant Wasserstein dependency measure, which restricts the optimization to this symmetry-aware subspace without loss of optimality. Practically, we parameterize the scoring function using a group Fourier representation and define the intrinsic reward via the alignment of equivariant latent features, ensuring that the discovered skills generalize systematically under group transformations. Experiments on state-based and pixel-based locomotion benchmarks demonstrate that GISD achieves broader state-space coverage and improved efficiency in downstream task learning compared to a strong baseline.\nI\nIntroduction\nUnsupervised skill discovery has become a central tool for acquiring reusable behavioral primitives that can accelerate downstream task learning. A wide range of methods learn latent skills by maximizing mutual information or distance-based objectives between skills and state trajectories\n[\n9\n,\n35\n,\n20\n,\n28\n,\n26\n,\n27\n]\n. These methods have shown that pretraining a diverse set of behaviors can substantially improve exploration, state coverage, and downstream task learning efficiency across challenging continuous-control benchmarks.\nDespite this progress, existing approaches often struggle to pretrain\nuseful\nskills efficiently. Standard distance-maximizing objectives treat the state space as largely unstructured, and must discover all behaviors directly in a high-dimensional latent space. Recent works attempt to impose additional priors to mitigate this difficulty—for example, LGSD\n[\n31\n]\nleverages language guidance to bias the skill space toward semantically meaningful behaviors, while “Do’s and Don’ts”\n[\n17\n]\nleverage desired behavioral preference priors. However, these methods still overlook a fundamental property of many robotic environments: the presence of strong geometric symmetries (e.g., rotations of a locomotion agent) that make many behaviors equivalent up to a group transformation. When such a structure is ignored, skill discovery tends to learn redundant variants of the same behavior, wasting samples and weakening generalization.\nTo address this limitation, we introduce\nGroup-Invariant Skill Discovery (GISD)\n, a framework that injects group symmetry directly into the skill discovery objective and representation.\nOur approach builds upon a key theoretical insight: in a group-invariant environment, the Wasserstein dependency measure\n[\n24\n]\nadmits a globally optimal solution comprised of an equivariant policy and a group-invariant scoring function\nf\nf\n. This existence guarantee implies that we can safely restrict the search space to a class of group-invariant scoring functions without any loss of optimality.\nBased on this principle, we formulate the Group-Invariant Wasserstein dependency measure (GIWDM), which directly optimizes the objective within this reduced subspace.\nGIWDM thus eliminates the redundancy of exploring non-symmetric solutions and ensures that the discovered skills inherently respect the environmental symmetry.\nBuilding on this theory, we parameterize the group-invariant scoring function in a group Fourier space, discovering skills whose latent representations explicitly encode the group symmetry. Once such symmetry-aware skills are learned, we can exploit the same structure: the agent can reuse a skill at novel configurations by transforming its latent representation under the group, enabling systematic generalization across group transformations.\nThe contributions of our work are summarized as follows:\n1)We prove that, in group-symmetric MDPs, the Wasserstein Dependency Measure (WDM) admits a globally optimal solution consisting of an equivariant policy and a group-invariant scoring function\nf\nf\n. This result justifies Group-Invariant Skill Discovery (GISD), which restricts\nf\nf\nto symmetry-respecting functions without sacrificing optimality.\n2) We instantiate GISD by parameterizing the group-invariant scoring function\nf\nf\nin the group Fourier domain. The intrinsic reward is defined via the alignment of equivariant Fourier features, producing skill representations that are group-symmetric by construction. We also show that this symmetric representation enables generalizable skill implementation under the group transformation in downstream tasks.\n3) We evaluate GISD on state-based and pixel-based locomotion benchmarks, showing improved sample efficiency and state-space coverage over a strong distance-based baseline.\nII\nRelated Work\nII-A\nUnsupervised Skill Discovery\nUnsupervised skill discovery seeks to learn diverse behaviors in reinforcement learning (RL) without relying on explicit reward signals and reuse them for efficient downstream task training. A common strategy is to maximize the dependency between states and skills, leading to distinct trajectories according to the different latent skill vectors. One of the classes of unsupervised skill discovery contains leveraging the mutual information (MI). MI-based approaches maximize the correlation between skill and state, typically via a Kullback-Liebler (KL)-divergence formulation\n[\n9\n,\n14\n,\n20\n,\n48\n]\n:\nI\n​\n(\n𝒮\n;\nZ\n)\n\\displaystyle I(\\mathcal{S};Z)\n=\nD\nK\n​\nL\n​\n(\np\n​\n(\ns\n,\nz\n)\n∥\np\n​\n(\ns\n)\n​\np\n​\n(\nz\n)\n)\n\\displaystyle=D_{KL}\\left(p(s,z)\\|p(s)p(z)\\right)\n=\n∫\n𝒮\n×\nZ\np\n​\n(\ns\n,\nz\n)\n​\nlog\n⁡\np\n​\n(\ns\n,\nz\n)\np\n​\n(\ns\n)\n​\np\n​\n(\nz\n)\n​\nd\n​\ns\n​\nd\n​\nz\n.\n\\displaystyle=\\int_{\\mathcal{S}\\times Z}p(s,z)\\log\\frac{p(s,z)}{p(s)p(z)}\\,dsdz.\nWhile they effectively uncover distinct skills, their reliance on KL divergence can limit overall state coverage.\nTo address the limitation of MI-based approach, distance-maximizing approaches, which is the other class in unsupervised skill discovery, replace MI with the\n1\n1\n-Wasserstein distance (or Kantorovich metric) for tractability, promoting both distinctness and a broader exploration of states\n[\n26\n,\n27\n,\n28\n,\n31\n]\n:\nI\n𝒲\n​\n(\n𝒮\n;\nZ\n)\n=\n𝒲\n​\n(\np\n​\n(\ns\n,\nz\n)\n,\np\n​\n(\ns\n)\n​\np\n​\n(\nz\n)\n)\nI_{\\mathcal{W}}(\\mathcal{S};Z)=\\mathcal{W}\\big(p(s,z),p(s)p(z)\\big)\nThese approaches map states to a compact latent space that preserves a chosen distance metric (e.g., temporal distance\n[\n28\n]\n, controllability distance\n[\n27\n]\n, or language distance\n[\n31\n]\n), thereby promoting both broad exploration and the discovery of skills that are well-separated under the metric.\nBased on distance-maximizing unsupervised skill discovery, recent studies have proposed methods to improve the quality of skills through the addition of prior knowledge. For example, one of the prior works, LGSD\n[\n31\n]\n, utilizes language prior to improve semantic diversity between skills. In another prior work, Do’s and Don’ts\n[\n17\n]\n, they utilize the prior knowledge of desired state transition for feasible skill discovery.\nIn this work, we also build upon distance-maximizing approaches by integrating a geometric prior, but our method differs in that it discovers skills directly from the inherent group symmetric structure of the space, and thereby, the skills are enabled to be discovered with the underlying geometric symmetry.\nII-B\nGroup Equivariance in Reinforcement Learning\nGroup equivariance is a mathematical property that characterizes how a function’s output transforms in response to a specified group action on its input. Incorporating this property into neural networks ensures that transformations of the input data induce predictable and consistent transformations of the output\n[\n12\n,\n39\n,\n13\n,\n47\n,\n21\n,\n2\n]\n. Recent works have explored group equivariance in robotic settings\n[\n49\n,\n16\n,\n15\n,\n33\n,\n32\n,\n18\n,\n36\n,\n34\n,\n25\n]\n: for example, some prior works\n[\n49\n,\n16\n,\n15\n]\napply group-equivariant convolutions to pick-and-place tasks, and other prior works\n[\n33\n,\n32\n,\n18\n,\n36\n]\nleverage roto-translation symmetry in three-dimensional environments, notably improving data efficiency and generalization. Such benefits are particularly relevant for RL, where sample efficiency remains a central challenge. Several studies have demonstrated that integrating group equivariance into RL algorithms yields enhanced performance and faster learning compared to standard methods\n[\n45\n,\n46\n,\n44\n,\n22\n,\n38\n,\n41\n,\n10\n,\n19\n,\n43\n,\n6\n]\n. Notably, some works\n[\n45\n,\n46\n]\nintroduce the concept of group-invariant Markov decision process (MDPs), offering a formal basis for these improvements. Building upon these successes, our work aims to incorporate group equivariance into unsupervised skill discovery, thereby addressing limitations in existing approaches and further advancing the potential of symmetry-based methods.\nIII\nPreliminaries\nIII-A\nDistance-Maximizing Skill Discovery\nDistance-maximizing skill discovery approaches\n[\n26\n,\n27\n,\n28\n,\n31\n,\n1\n]\nemploy the Wasserstein dependency measure (WDM)\n[\n24\n]\n, an equivalent formulation of the 1-Wasserstein distance due to the Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality\n[\n42\n]\n.

Symmetries satisfy the axioms of associativity, identity, inverse, and closure, and the collection of all such transformations forms a\ngroup\n. In our setting, the relevant symmetry is planar rotation, represented by the continuous group\nS\n​\nO\n​\n(\n2\n)\nSO(2)\n. For practical implementation, we approximate this continuous symmetry using a discrete cyclic subgroup\nC\nN\nC_{N}\n, where rotations are quantized in increments of\n2\n​\nπ\n/\nN\n2\\pi/N\n.\nA\ngroup representation\nρ\n:\nG\n→\nG\n​\nL\n​\n(\nn\n)\n\\rho:G\\to GL(n)\nmaps each group element\ng\n∈\nG\ng\\in G\nto an invertible\nn\n×\nn\nn\\times n\nmatrix that describes how\nG\nG\nacts on a vector space. Examples include the\ntrivial representation\nρ\n0\n​\n(\ng\n)\n​\nx\n=\nx\n\\rho_{0}(g)x=x\n, which leaves the space unchanged, and the\nregular representation\non\nℝ\n|\nG\n|\n\\mathbb{R}^{|G|}\n, which can be decomposed into\nirreducible representations\nρ\nk\n\\rho_{k}\nthat cannot be further reduced.

This reduction provides both computational efficiency and structural guarantees tied to the underlying group.\nIV\nProblem Statement\nIn line with previous unsupervised skill discovery approaches, the problem is formalized within the framework of a reward-free MDP, denoted as\nℳ\n=\n(\n𝒮\n,\n𝒜\n,\nP\n)\n\\mathcal{M}=(\\mathcal{S},\\mathcal{A},P)\n.\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\n,\n𝒜\n\\mathcal{A}\n, and\nP\nP\nrepresent the state space, action space, and transition probabilities\nP\n:\n𝒮\n×\n𝒜\n→\n𝒮\nP:\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{S}\n, respectively. The latent skill vector\nz\n∈\nZ\nz\\in Z\nis sampled from the prior distribution,\nz\n∼\np\n​\n(\nz\n)\nz\\sim p(z)\n. The policy is conditioned by the skill vector,\nπ\n​\n(\na\n|\ns\n,\nz\n)\n\\pi(a|s,z)\n, the skill vector informing the policy to select the corresponding action sequence. During the training, the skill vector doesn’t change during the episode, and the policy is trained without any reward supervision, only with the intrinsic reward.\nIn this framework, we leverage the group symmetric prior, prior knowledge of rotation symmetry, to enhance the sample efficiency and generalizability. We convert the original MDPs to group-invariant MDPs by assuming the group-invariance of the intrinsic reward function and transition probability.\nFigure 1:\nOverview of Group-Invariant Skill Discovery (GISD).\nOur method learns an equivariant mapping\nϕ\nF\n\\phi_{F}\nfrom the state space\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\nto the\nGroup Fourier space\nZ\nZ\n. By aligning state transitions with latent skill vectors\nz\nz\nin the group Fourier domain, the discovered skills inherently respect the underlying geometric symmetry. This structure enables generalization: a policy trained for a specific trajectory\nτ\n\\tau\nautomatically generalizes to any group-transformed trajectory\ng\n​\nτ\ng\\tau\nby simply shifting the skill vector along its group orbit to\ng\n​\nz\ngz\n.\nV\nMethods\nIn this section, we present Group-Invariant Skill Discovery (GISD), a method that leverages the symmetry of the underlying dynamics to accelerate unsupervised skill discovery. We begin by showing that, in a group-invariant environment, the standard Wasserstein dependency measure (WDM) objective already admits symmetry-respecting optimal solutions. Motivated by this result, we then introduce a Group-Invariant WDM formulation and a practical Fourier-space parameterization and intrinsic reward.\nV-A\nTheoretical Analysis: Symmetry of Optimal Solutions\nBefore introducing GISD, we analyze the structure of optimal solutions to the standard WDM-based skill discovery problem. We show that, under group-invariant dynamics, restricting the search to symmetry-aware policies does not compromise optimality.\nTheorem 1\n(Existence of Equivariant Optima)\n.\nIn an MDP where the dynamics, initial state distribution, skill prior, and ground metric are all group-invariant, the Wasserstein dependency measure admits a globally optimal solution\n(\nπ\n¯\n,\nf\n¯\n)\n(\\bar{\\pi},\\bar{f})\nsuch that\nπ\n¯\n​\n(\ng\n​\na\n∣\ng\n​\ns\n,\ng\n​\nz\n)\n=\nπ\n¯\n​\n(\na\n∣\ns\n,\nz\n)\n,\nf\n¯\n​\n(\ng\n​\ns\n,\ng\n​\nz\n)\n=\nf\n¯\n​\n(\ns\n,\nz\n)\n,\n∀\ng\n∈\nG\n.\n\\bar{\\pi}(ga\\mid gs,gz)=\\bar{\\pi}(a\\mid s,z),\\quad\\bar{f}(gs,gz)=\\bar{f}(s,z),\\quad\\forall g\\in G.\nIn other words, among all WDM global maximizers, there exists at least one policy-function pair with an equivariant policy and a group-invariant\n1\n1\n-Lipschitz function.\nFor proof, see Appendix\nVII-A\n.\nThis theoretical guarantee implies that the exploration of non-equivariant policies—which correspond to redundant or suboptimal solutions in a symmetric environment—is unnecessary. This justifies restricting the search to the symmetry-aware function class without sacrificing global optimality.\nV-B\nGroup-Invariant Wasserstein Dependency Measure\nTheorem\n1\nshows that in a group-invariant environment, the standard Wasserstein dependency measure (WDM) admits at least one global optimum where the policy is equivariant and the scoring function\nf\nf\nis group-invariant. This motivates explicitly restricting the scoring function class to symmetry-respecting functions: instead of hoping that symmetry emerges implicitly, we bake it into the objective.\nLet\nG\nG\nact on the state space\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\nand skill space\nZ\nZ\n, and let\nd\nd\nbe a distance metric on\n𝒮\n×\nZ\n\\mathcal{S}\\times Z\nthat is group-invariant under the joint action:\nd\n​\n(\n(\ng\n​\ns\n,\ng\n​\nz\n)\n,\n(\ng\n​\ns\n′\n,\ng\n​\nz\n′\n)\n)\n=\nd\n​\n(\n(\ns\n,\nz\n)\n,\n(\ns\n′\n,\nz\n′\n)\n)\n,\n∀\ng\n∈\nG\n.\nd((gs,gz),(gs^{\\prime},gz^{\\prime}))=d((s,z),(s^{\\prime},z^{\\prime})),\\quad\\forall g\\in G.\nWe define the group-invariant scoring function class\nℱ\nG\n\\mathcal{F}_{G}\nas the set of 1-Lipschitz functions\nf\n:\n𝒮\n×\nZ\n→\nℝ\nf:\\mathcal{S}\\times Z\\to\\mathbb{R}\nthat are\ninvariant under the joint action of\nG\nG\n:\nℱ\nG\n:=\n{\nf\n|\n‖\nf\n‖\nL\n≤\n1\n,\nf\n​\n(\ng\n​\ns\n,\ng\n​\nz\n)\n=\nf\n​\n(\ns\n,\nz\n)\n,\n∀\ng\n∈\nG\n}\n.\n\\mathcal{F}_{G}\\\\\n:=\\bigl\\{f\\;\\big|\\;\\|f\\|_{L}\\leq 1,\\;f(gs,gz)=f(s,z),\\;\\forall g\\in G\\bigr\\}.\nDefinition 1\n(Group-Invariant WDM)\n.\nGiven a group-invariant metric\nd\nd\non\nS\n×\nZ\nS\\times Z\n, the\ngroup-invariant\nWasserstein dependency measure is defined as\nI\n𝒲\nG\n(\n𝒮\n;\nZ\n)\n:=\nsup\nf\n∈\nℱ\nG\n𝔼\np\n​\n(\ns\n,\nz\n)\n[\nf\n(\ns\n,\nz\n)\n]\n−\n𝔼\np\n​\n(\ns\n)\n​\np\n​\n(\nz\n)\n[\nf\n(\ns\n,\nz\n)\n]\n)\n.\nI_{\\mathcal{W}}^{G}(\\mathcal{S};Z):=\\sup_{f\\in\\mathcal{F}_{G}}\\mathbb{E}_{p(s,z)}[f(s,z)]-\\mathbb{E}_{p(s)p(z)}[f(s,z)]).\nThis constrained objective guarantees invariance under the group action,\na property not generally enjoyed by the standard WDM.\nProposition 1\n.\nIf the distance metric\nd\nd\nis group-invariant, then the\ngroup-invariant WDM satisfies\nI\n𝒲\nG\n​\n(\ng\n​\n𝒮\n;\ng\n​\nZ\n)\n=\nI\n𝒲\nG\n​\n(\n𝒮\n;\nZ\n)\nI_{\\mathcal{W}}^{G}(g\\mathcal{S};gZ)=I_{\\mathcal{W}}^{G}(\\mathcal{S};Z)\nfor all\ng\n∈\nG\ng\\in G\n.\nProof is provided in Appendix\nVII-B\n.\nReduction of the search space.\nCompared to the standard WDM, which optimizes over all 1-Lipschitz functions,\nI\n𝒲\nG\nI^{G}_{\\mathcal{W}}\nrestricts the scoring function class to the group-invariant subset\nℱ\nG\n\\mathcal{F}_{G}\n.

Thus, for symmetric optima, the restricted and unconstrained WDMs coincide.\nV-D\nSkill Discovery in the Group Fourier Space\nIn contrast to the decompositions of\nf\n​\n(\ns\n,\nz\n)\nf(s,z)\nused in prior works\n[\n26\n,\n27\n,\n28\n]\n, we\nderive our parameterization from a group representation-theoretic\nviewpoint. Assume a compact group\nG\nG\nacts on the state space\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\nand latent skill space\nZ\nZ\n. We consider the induced action\nof the product group\nG\n×\nG\nG\\times G\non\n𝒮\n×\nZ\n\\mathcal{S}\\times Z\n, given by\n(\ng\n1\n,\ng\n2\n)\n⋅\n(\ns\n,\nz\n)\n=\n(\ng\n1\n​\ns\n,\ng\n2\n​\nz\n)\n(g_{1},g_{2})\\cdot(s,z)=(g_{1}s,g_{2}z)\n, and define\nf\ng\n1\n,\ng\n2\n​\n(\ns\n,\nz\n)\n:=\nf\n​\n(\ng\n1\n​\ns\n,\ng\n2\n​\nz\n)\n.\nf_{g_{1},g_{2}}(s,z):=f(g_{1}s,g_{2}z).\nFor each fixed\n(\ns\n,\nz\n)\n(s,z)\n, the map\n(\ng\n1\n,\ng\n2\n)\n↦\nf\ng\n1\n,\ng\n2\n​\n(\ns\n,\nz\n)\n(g_{1},g_{2})\\mapsto f_{g_{1},g_{2}}(s,z)\nis square-integrable on\nG\n×\nG\nG\\times G\n, i.e.,\nf\n(\n⋅\n,\n⋅\n)\n∈\nL\n2\n​\n(\nG\n×\nG\n)\nf_{(\\cdot,\\cdot)}\\in L^{2}(G\\times G)\n.

Consequently, the double sum collapses into a single sum over the spectrum:\nf\n~\n​\n(\ns\n,\nz\n)\n=\n∑\nρ\n∈\nG\n^\nλ\nρ\n​\n(\ns\n,\nz\n)\n,\n\\tilde{f}(s,z)=\\sum_{\\rho\\in\\hat{G}}\\lambda_{\\rho}(s,z),\nwhere each\nλ\nρ\n​\n(\ns\n,\nz\n)\n\\lambda_{\\rho}(s,z)\nrepresents the scalar contraction of the matching representation blocks.\nWe now parameterize these scalar coefficients in terms of\nFourier-space features\nof\ns\ns\nand\nz\nz\n.\nFor each surviving irrep\nρ\n\\rho\n, we introduce feature vectors\nϕ\nρ\n​\n(\ns\n)\n\\phi_{\\rho}(s)\nand\nψ\nρ\n​\n(\nz\n)\n\\psi_{\\rho}(z)\nin the corresponding representation\nspaces and parameterize\nλ\nρ\n​\n(\ns\n,\nz\n)\n≈\n⟨\nϕ\nρ\n​\n(\ns\n)\n,\nψ\nρ\n​\n(\nz\n)\n⟩\n.\n\\lambda_{\\rho}(s,z)\\approx\\big\\langle\\phi_{\\rho}(s),\\,\\psi_{\\rho}(z)\\big\\rangle.\nStacking all irrep components into a single global feature vector, we obtain\nthe maps\nϕ\nF\n:\n𝒮\n→\nℝ\nd\n,\nψ\nF\n:\nZ\n→\nℝ\nd\n,\n\\phi_{F}:\\mathcal{S}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{d},\\quad\\psi_{F}:Z\\to\\mathbb{R}^{d},\nand the group-averaged scoring function takes the inner-product form:\nf\n~\n​\n(\ns\n,\nz\n)\n≈\n⟨\nϕ\nF\n​\n(\ns\n)\n,\nψ\nF\n​\n(\nz\n)\n⟩\n.\n\\tilde{f}(s,z)\\approx\\big\\langle\\phi_{F}(s),\\psi_{F}(z)\\big\\rangle.\nBy construction,\nϕ\nF\n\\phi_{F}\nmaps states into the spectral domain and satisfies the\nequivariance\nproperty:\nϕ\nF\n​\n(\ng\n​\ns\n)\n=\nρ\nF\n​\n(\ng\n)\n​\nϕ\nF\n​\n(\ns\n)\n,\n\\phi_{F}(gs)=\\rho_{F}(g)\\phi_{F}(s),\n(3)\nwhere\nρ\nF\n​\n(\ng\n)\n\\rho_{F}(g)\ndenotes the block-diagonal direct sum of unitary irreducible representations acting on the feature vector. Following METRA\n[\n28\n]\n, we\nset\nψ\nF\n​\n(\nz\n)\n=\nz\n\\psi_{F}(z)=z\n, treating the latent skill\nz\nz\nas a\nunit-norm vector in Fourier space. This choice, together with a 1-Lipschitz parameterization of\nϕ\nF\n\\phi_{F}\n,\nis compatible with the\n1\n1\n-Lipschitz constraint required by the WDM\nobjective.\nFrequency Filtering and Interpretability.\nA key advantage of working in Fourier space is the explicit separation\nof geometric frequencies. The feature vector\nϕ\nF\n​\n(\ns\n)\n\\phi_{F}(s)\nis a\nconcatenation of coefficients corresponding to different irreducible representations (frequencies). Unlike unstructured latent spaces, this allows us to manually emphasize or suppress specific symmetries by applying a frequency mask\nM\nM\n:\nf\n~\n​\n(\ns\n,\nz\n)\n=\n⟨\nM\n⋅\nϕ\nF\n​\n(\ns\n)\n,\nz\n⟩\n.\n\\tilde{f}(s,z)=\\big\\langle M\\cdot\\phi_{F}(s),\\,z\\big\\rangle.\nFor example, by selecting only the trivial representation (\nρ\n0\n\\rho_{0}\n), we\ncan discover purely group-invariant skills. By selecting higher-order frequencies, we encourage skills that are sensitive to the group action. This provides a degree of interpretability and controllability unavailable in standard unsupervised skill discovery.\nV-E\nGroup-Invariant MDP for Skill Discovery\nUsing the group-invariant scoring function parameterization from\nSection\nV-D\n, we now derive the intrinsic reward used for\nskill discovery and show that it is itself group-invariant.\nRecall that METRA\n[\n28\n]\noptimizes a WDM-style objective\nover trajectories (Eq. (\n1\n)).\nIn our framework, we restrict to group-invariant scoring functions and\nparameterize the group-averaged scoring function as an inner product in Fourier\nspace,\nf\n~\n​\n(\ns\n,\nz\n)\n≈\n⟨\nϕ\nF\n​\n(\ns\n)\n,\nz\n⟩\n,\n\\tilde{f}(s,z)\\approx\\big\\langle\\phi_{F}(s),z\\big\\rangle,\nwhere\nϕ\nF\n\\phi_{F}\nis equivariant with respect to the group action\n(Section\nV-D\n).

Such preprocessing typically warps coordinates and breaks equivariance.\nIn this setting, we restrict the Fourier representation to the frequency-\n1\n1\nC\n4\nC_{4}\nirrep and discover 2D latent skills in this subspace, matching the skill dimensionality used in METRA (as introduced in Section\nV-D\n). Intuitively, this emphasizes directional, rotation equivariant behaviors (e.g., ”move in a given heading”), which are most relevant in Ant locomotion.\nWe empirically observed that incorporating invariant components had little benefit and could introduce noise in discovery, so we focus on the equivariant features in this work.\nPixel-based Quadruped (\nD\n1\n≅\nC\n2\nD_{1}\\cong C_{2}\n/ flip symmetry\n).\nFor pixel-based skill discovery, we adopt the vision-based quadruped environment from the DeepMind Control Suite (DMC)\n[\n40\n]\n), following the METRA\n[\n28\n]\nsetup.\nMETRA encodes position information by making the floor color vary smoothly as a function of the agent’s\n(\nx\n,\ny\n)\n(x,y)\ncoordinates.\nTo fully expose the horizontal flip symmetry to the agent, we instead redesign the floor so that its color varies\nradially\nfrom the origin.\nThis maintains a consistent appearance under left-right flips while still revealing global position, and matches the\nC\n2\nC_{2}\n(horizontal flip) symmetry.\nThe group\nC\n2\nC_{2}\nhas a 2D real representation consisting of an invariant channel and a sign-flip channel. To keep the comparison with METRA fair, we use a 4D latent skill space by concatenating two such Fourier-feature vectors.\nThis can be viewed as learning two independent Fourier components. In practice, this provided a good balance between expressivity and parity with the baseline.\nSymmetry-aware Policy.\nOn the control side, we use Partially Equivariant SAC\n[\n6\n]\nfor the state-based Ant, which is robust to local symmetry-breaking effects (e.g., contact asymmetries).\nFor the pixel-based quadruped, we use Equivariant SAC\n[\n46\n]\n.\nIn both environments, a high-level policy\nπ\nh\n​\n(\nz\n∣\ns\n,\ng\n)\n\\pi^{h}(z\\mid s,g)\nselects a skill vector\nz\nz\nevery\nK\nK\nsteps to pursue a goal\ng\ng\n, while a low-level policy\nπ\nl\n​\n(\na\n∣\ns\n,\nz\n)\n\\pi^{l}(a\\mid s,z)\nexecutes the learned skill.\nThe skill policy is pretrained and then forzen for downstream training, as in METRA.\nFigure 2:\nBenchmark Environments.\nWe evaluate GISD in state-based Ant and pixel-based Quadruped locomotion.\nIn the pixel-based setting, we redesign the floor so that color varies radially from the origin,\nmaking the observations consistent with the horizontal flip symmetry.\nVI-B\nEvalutation Metric\nWe evaluate both skill discovery and downstream task performance.\nStaet-space coverage.\nFollowing METRA\n[\n28\n]\n, we measure how well skills explore the environment by computing the coverage of the agent’s\n(\nx\n,\ny\n)\n(x,y)\npositions.\nAt evaluation, we sample 48 latent skill vectors uniformly from the skill prior, roll each for a fixed horizon, and aggregate the resulting trajectories.\nWe then quantify coverage using the fraction of grid cells visited in the task-relevant region of the plane.\nFor the state-based Ant, we restrict the coverage region to\n[\n−\n30\n,\n30\n]\n2\n[-30,30]^{2}\n, which corresponds to the maximum distance the agent can reach under the goal-sampling scheme in the downstream tasks. This avoids counting irrelevant areas.\nDownstream task.\nWe next assess how useful the discovered skills are for solving goal-conditioned tasks.\nWe train a high-level policy (\nπ\nh\n​\n(\nz\n∣\ns\n,\ng\n)\n\\pi^{h}(z\\mid s,g)\non top of the frozen skill policy\n(\nπ\n(\na\n∣\ns\n,\nz\n)\n(\\pi(a\\mid s,z)\n.\nIn the state-based Ant environment, each episode is a multi-goal task:\nWhenever the current goal is reached-or after\nK\nK\nsteps-a new goal is sampled uniformly around the current position (we follow METRA and use a sampling range of\n[\n−\n7.5\n,\n7.5\n]\n2\n[-7.5,7.5]^{2}\n.\nWe report the average return as a function of training iterations during downstream task training, averaged over multiple random seeds.\nFigure 3:\nState-space coverage during skill discovery.\n(a)\nState-based Ant (4 seeds).\n(b)\nPixel-based Quadruped (5 seeds).\nShaded regions show standard error.\nGISD achieves higher coverage and better sample efficiency than METRA in both environments.\nVI-C\nResults and Analysis\nSkill discovery and state coverage.\nFigure\n3\nshows the evolution of\n(\nx\n,\ny\n)\n(x,y)\n-coverage during skill pretraining.\nAcross both state-based Ant and pixel-based quadruped, GISD achieves broader state-space coverage with higher sample efficiency than METRA.\nThe shaded regions indicate standard error across seeds.\nIn the Ant environment, the variance is larger due to the lack of observation normalization, which makes the learning dynamics more sensitive to initialization.\nTo qualitatively understand the learned behaviors, Figure\n4\nvisualizes trajectories induced by 48 randomly sampled skills.\nFor GISD, skills tile the plane in a symmetry-consistent way:\nIn Ant, each direction has rotationally related counterparts (approximately obeying the\nC\n4\nC_{4}\nsymmetry).\nIn Quadruped, up-down reflected skills exhibit mirrored trajectories under the flip symmetry.\nIn contrast, METRA often learns clusters of redundant skills that differ only slightly in direction or fail to cover all symmetric modes, which matches the quantitative coverage gap.\nFigure 4:\nVisualization of discovered skills.\nWe plot trajectories for 48 randomly sampled skills. Colors indicate different latent skills.\nGISD discovers symmetry-consistent skills (Ant:\nC\n4\nC_{4}\nrotations; Quadruped: horizontal flips),\nleading to substantially broader and more uniform state-space coverage than METRA.\nDownstream performance.\nFigure\n5\ncompares downstream goal-reaching performance.\nIn both the state-based Ant and pixel-based DMC Quadruped tasks, GISD attains higher returns than METRA and reaches strong performance with fewer environment steps.\nFigure\n6\nvisualizes the Fourier skill vectors selected by the high-level policy\nπ\nh\n​\n(\nz\n∣\ns\n,\ng\n)\n\\pi^{h}(z\\mid s,g)\nin the DMC Quadruped environment. Starting from a shared initial state with horizontally mirrored goals, the policy chooses skills whose invariant components are nearly identical, while the equivariant components exhibit approximate sign flips. This behavior reflects the underlying flip symmetry and indicates that the Fourier-space skills learned by GISD are both diverse and systematically reusable across transformed tasks.\nFigure 5:\nDownstream task performance.\n(a)\nAverage return in the state-based Ant environment (4 seeds).\n(b)\nAverage return in the pixel-based Quadruped environment (3 seeds).\nShaded regions show standard error.\nGISD consistently achieves higher performance and better sample efficiency than METRA.\nOverall, these results support our main claim:\nBy constraining the scoring function to a group-invariant function class and parameterizing it in Fourier space, GISD discovers symmetry-aligned skills that explore more effectively and transfer more efficiently to downstream control.\nFigure 6:\nVisualization of downstream task in DMC Quadruped.\nStarting from identical initial states with horizontally flipped goal positions, we visualize the Fourier skill vectors predicted by the high-level policy over time. Blue bars denote the invariant components, while orange bars denote the equivariant components, which should flip sign under the flip transformation. At early time steps (\nt\n=\n0\n,\n1\nt=0,1\n), the invariant features closely match, and the equivariant features appear with approximately opposite signs and similar magnitudes. By\nt\n=\n2\nt=2\n, the components begin to diverge, reflecting accumulated symmetry-breaking during execution (e.g., the quadruped’s rolling behavior under each skill).\nVII\nConclusions and Limitations\nIn this work, we introduced\nGroup-Invariant Skill Discovery\n, a framework that exploits group equivariance in skill discovery to improve sample efficiency and generalization. By enforcing group invariance in the Wasserstein dependency measure, we recast the objective as a symmetry-aware MDP and obtain latent skills that are consistent with the underlying group structure, which can then be effectively reused in downstream tasks.\nOur experiments validate the approach on both state-based and vision-based locomotion benchmarks, but a natural next step is to test it on more challenging domains such as Humanoid control. The method also inherits common limitations of equivariant networks, including increased computational cost and the need to specify the relevant symmetry group a priori.\nLooking forward, we plan to extend this framework to manipulation tasks, where skill discovery is notoriously difficult but rich symmetries are often present. Another promising direction is to study how the symmetric structure of the discovered skills can be more directly exploited in downstream planning and policy learning.\nAppendix A.

We denote the transition probability of the underlying MDP as\nP\nl\n​\n(\ns\n′\n∣\ns\n,\na\n)\nP^{l}(s^{\\prime}\\mid s,a)\n. Group-invariance of the dynamics implies that\nP\nl\n​\n(\ng\n​\ns\n′\n∣\ng\n​\ns\n,\ng\n​\na\n)\n=\nP\nl\n​\n(\ns\n′\n∣\ns\n,\na\n)\nP^{l}(gs^{\\prime}\\mid gs,ga)=P^{l}(s^{\\prime}\\mid s,a)\nfor all\ng\n∈\nG\ng\\in G\n. Furthermore, let\nπ\n​\n(\na\n∣\ns\n,\nz\n)\n\\pi(a\\mid s,z)\nbe the low-level skill policy. Equivariance of the policy implies\nπ\n​\n(\ng\n​\na\n∣\ng\n​\ns\n,\ng\n​\nz\n)\n=\nπ\n​\n(\na\n∣\ns\n,\nz\n)\n\\pi(ga\\mid gs,gz)=\\pi(a\\mid s,z)\n. We define\nP\nk\n​\n(\ns\nt\n+\nk\n∣\ns\nt\n,\nz\n)\nP_{k}(s_{t+k}\\mid s_{t},z)\nas the transition probability of the Semi-MDP, representing the likelihood of reaching state\ns\nt\n+\nk\ns_{t+k}\nfrom\ns\nt\ns_{t}\nafter executing skill\nz\nz\nfor\nk\nk\nsteps.\nTheorem\n2\n(Group-invariant Fixed-interval Semi-MDP)\n.\nAssume the environment dynamics are group-invariant and the pretrained skill policy is equivariant:\nP\nl\n​\n(\ng\n​\ns\n′\n∣\ng\n​\ns\n,\ng\n​\na\n)\n\\displaystyle P^{l}(gs^{\\prime}\\mid gs,ga)\n=\nP\nl\n​\n(\ns\n′\n∣\ns\n,\na\n)\n\\displaystyle=P^{l}(s^{\\prime}\\mid s,a)\nπ\nl\n​\n(\ng\n​\na\n∣\ng\n​\ns\n,\ng\n​\nz\n)\n\\displaystyle\\pi^{l}(ga\\mid gs,gz)\n=\nπ\nl\n​\n(\na\n∣\ns\n,\nz\n)\n∀\ng\n∈\nG\n.\n\\displaystyle=\\pi^{l}(a\\mid s,z)\\quad\\forall g\\in G.\nThen, the induced high-level transition kernel (Eq. (\n7\n)) satisfies group invariance:\nP\nk\n​\n(\ng\n​\ns\nt\n+\nk\n∣\ng\n​\ns\nt\n,\ng\n​\nz\n)\n=\nP\nk\n​\n(\ns\nt\n+\nk\n∣\ns\nt\n,\nz\n)\n,\n∀\ng\n∈\nG\n.\nP_{k}(gs_{t+k}\\mid gs_{t},gz)=P_{k}(s_{t+k}\\mid s_{t},z),\\qquad\\forall g\\in G.\nConsequently, the fixed-interval semi-MDP is group-invariant whenever the high-level reward is group-invariant.\nProof.\nThe probability of reaching state\ns\nt\n+\nk\ns_{t+k}\nfrom\ns\nt\ns_{t}\nunder skill\nz\nz\nis obtained by marginalizing over all possible intermediate trajectories of actions\na\nt\n:\nt\n+\nk\n−\n1\na_{t:t+k-1}\nand states\ns\nt\n+\n1\n:\nt\n+\nk\n−\n1\ns_{t+1:t+k-1}\n.

    "preview_text": "Unsupervised skill discovery aims to acquire behavior primitives that improve exploration and accelerate downstream task learning. However, existing approaches often ignore the geometric symmetries of physical environments, leading to redundant behaviors and sample inefficiency. To address this, we introduce Group-Invariant Skill Discovery (GISD), a framework that explicitly embeds group structure into the skill discovery objective. Our approach is grounded in a theoretical guarantee: we prove that in group-symmetric environments, the standard Wasserstein dependency measure admits a globally optimal solution comprised of an equivariant policy and a group-invariant scoring function. Motivated by this, we formulate the Group-Invariant Wasserstein dependency measure, which restricts the optimization to this symmetry-aware subspace without loss of optimality. Practically, we parameterize the scoring function using a group Fourier representation and define the intrinsic reward via the alignment of equivariant latent features, ensuring that the discovered skills generalize systematically under group transformations. Experiments on state-based and pixel-based locomotion benchmarks demonstrate that GISD achieves broader state-space coverage and improved efficiency in downstream task learning compared to a strong baseline.\n\nGroup-Invariant Unsupervised Skill Discovery: Symmetry-aware Skill Representations for Generalizable Behavior\nJunwoo Chang\n,\nJoseph Park\n,\nRoberto Horowitz\n,\nJongmin Lee\n,\nand Jongeun Choi\n(Corresponding authors: Jongeun Choi and Jongmin Lee.)Junwoo Chang, Joseph Park, and Jongeun Choi are with the School of Mechanical Engineering,\nYonsei University, Seoul, South Korea (\ne-mails: junwoochang@yonsei.ac.kr;\niamjoseph1129@yonsei.ac.kr; jongeunchoi@yonsei.ac.kr\n).\nJongmin Lee and Jongeun Choi are with the Department of Artificial Intelligence,\nYonsei University, Seoul, South Korea (\ne-mails: jongminlee@yonsei.ac.kr;\njongeunchoi@yonsei.ac.kr\n).\nJongeun Choi an",

            "answer": "## 论文核心分析\n\n### **论文标题**\nGroup-Invariant Unsupervised Skill Discovery: Symmetry-aware Skill Representations for Generalizable Behavior\n\n### **核心问题**\n现有的无监督技能发现方法通常忽略物理环境中固有的**几何对称性**（例如，机器人旋转后行为本质相同）。这导致两个主要问题：\n1.  **样本效率低下**：算法会学习大量仅在对称变换下有差异的“冗余”行为，浪费探索样本。\n2.  **泛化能力弱**：学到的技能缺乏对对称结构的显式编码，难以系统性地泛化到经过群变换（如旋转、翻转）的新任务配置上。\n\n### **核心创新点**\n论文提出了 **“群不变无监督技能发现”** 框架，其创新性体现在**理论、方法和应用**三个层面：\n\n1.  **理论创新：证明了对称最优解的存在性**\n    *   **定理**：在具有群对称性的马尔可夫决策过程中，标准的Wasserstein依赖度量的**全局最优解**必然包含一个**等变策略**和一个**群不变评分函数**。\n    *   **价值**：这一理论保证为方法提供了严格依据。它表明，将搜索空间限制在对称感知的函数类中，**不会损失最优性**，从而可以安全地引入对称性作为归纳偏置，避免探索冗余的非对称解。\n\n2.  **方法创新：构建了群不变的Wasserstein依赖度量**\n    *   **GIWDM**：基于上述理论，论文定义了**群不变Wasserstein依赖度量**。它通过将评分函数 `f` 限制在群不变函数类 `ℱ_G` 中，显式地将对称性嵌入目标函数。\n    *   **傅里叶空间参数化**：为实现群不变评分函数，论文创新性地在**群傅里叶空间**中对 `f` 进行参数化。具体地，学习一个等变的特征映射 `φ_F`，将状态映射到由群不可约表示（对应不同“频率”）系数构成的傅里叶特征空间。内在奖励定义为状态傅里叶特征变化与技能向量的对齐程度。\n        ```python\n        # 核心奖励函数\n        r(s_t, z, s_{t+1}) = ⟨φ_F(s_{t+1}) - φ_F(s_t), z⟩\n        # 其中 φ_F 是等变映射，z 是傅里叶空间中的技能向量\n        ```\n    *   **对称性下游利用**：学到的技能在傅里叶空间中表示。在下游任务中，高层策略可以通过对技能向量 `z` 施加群变换（如旋转对应的傅里叶系数），直接生成适用于变换后环境（如新朝向）的行为，实现**系统性泛化**。\n\n3.  **应用创新：实现了对称性从发现到利用的闭环**\n    *   整个框架确保了从技能发现（对称的 `φ_F` 和策略 `π`）到下游分层控制（对称的高层半MDP）的整个过程都保持对称性，形成了**可泛化行为学习**的完整链路。\n\n### **解决方案总结**\n论文通过 **“理论保证 -> 目标约束 -> 具体实现”** 的路径解决问题：\n\n1.  **理论奠基**：首先证明在对称环境中，最优技能本身就应该是对称的。\n2.  **目标改造**：据此，将标准的无监督技能发现目标（最大化Wasserstein依赖）改造为**群不变版本**，强制算法在对称子空间内搜索。\n3.  **算法实现**：利用**群表示论**和**傅里叶分析**，设计出天然满足群不变性要求的网络架构（`φ_F`）和奖励函数。\n4.  **泛化机制**：利用学到的**等变技能表示**，在下游任务中通过变换技能向量直接生成新行为，无需重新学习。\n\n### **实际价值**\n*   **提升样本效率**：实验表明，在Ant和Quadruped等具有旋转/翻转对称性的运动环境中，GISD比基线方法（METRA）以更少的样本实现了**更广的状态空间覆盖**。\n*   **增强泛化能力**：学到的技能具有清晰的对称结构，使智能体能够通过简单的技能向量变换，适应经过群变换的任务，提高了**下游任务的学习速度**和最终性能。\n*   **提供可解释性**：傅里叶空间表示将技能分解到不同的对称“频率”分量，允许研究者通过过滤特定频率来偏向发现某种类型的技能（如完全不变的或对旋转敏感的），这为技能发现提供了**新的可控性和解释维度**。\n\n**总而言之，这篇论文的核心贡献是将群对称性这一先验知识，以一种有理论保障、可实现、且能直接促进泛化的方式，系统地注入到了无监督技能发现的全流程中，从而显著提升了方法的效率和所学技能的可复用性。**",

            "answer": "## 论文发展脉络梳理：从无监督技能发现到群不变技能发现\n\n本文《Group-Invariant Unsupervised Skill Discovery》是无监督技能发现领域的一个最新进展，它通过**显式地融入几何对称性先验**来解决现有方法在对称环境中学习冗余技能、样本效率低下的问题。要理解其贡献，需要梳理该领域从基础方法到引入各种先验知识，再到本文引入对称性先验的整个发展脉络。以下是几个关键发展方向及其演进：\n\n### 发展方向一：依赖度量与优化目标的演进\n\n这个方向的核心是**如何定义和最大化“技能”与“状态/轨迹”之间的关联性**，以驱动策略学习到多样化的行为。\n\n- **1. 互信息最大化 (Mutual Information, MI)**\n    - **代表工作**：DIAYN [9], VIC [14], CIC [20]。\n    - **核心思想**：最大化技能 `z` 与状态 `s` 之间的互信息 `I(S; Z)`。直观上，不同技能应导致不同的状态分布。\n    - **改进与局限**：\n        - **改进**：首次系统性地将无监督技能发现形式化为互信息最大化问题，证明了学习多样化、可区分行为的可行性。\n        - **局限**：基于KL散度的目标可能鼓励策略访问易于区分的状态子集，而非广泛探索整个状态空间，导致**状态覆盖率有限**。\n\n- **2. 距离最大化 (Distance Maximization) / 瓦瑟斯坦依赖度量 (Wasserstein Dependency Measure, WDM)**\n    - **代表工作**：LSD [26], CSD [27], METRA [28]。\n    - **核心思想**：用1-瓦瑟斯坦距离（对偶形式）替代互信息中的KL散度。其目标 `I_W(S; Z)` 寻求一个1-Lipschitz评分函数 `f(s,z)`，以区分联合分布 `p(s,z)` 和边际分布之积 `p(s)p(z)`。\n    - **改进**：\n        - **理论优势**：WDM与在潜在空间中保留特定**距离度量**（如时序距离、可控性距离）直接相关，能更自然地鼓励**广泛的状态探索**。\n        - **实践优势**：通过参数化 `f(s,z) = φ(s)^T ψ(z)` 并利用对偶理论，可以推导出易于计算的内在奖励（如 `r_t = (φ(s_{t+1}) - φ(s_t))^T z`），使训练更稳定高效。\n    - **本文的定位**：GISD **直接建立在WDM框架之上**（特别是METRA），其核心创新不是改变依赖度量本身，而是**为评分函数 `f` 和策略 `π` 施加了对称性约束**。\n\n### 发展方向二：融入先验知识以引导技能发现\n\n由于纯无监督学习可能产生无意义或难以利用的技能，后续工作尝试融入各种先验来引导技能朝向更有用的方向发展。\n\n- **1. 语言先验**\n    - **代表工作**：LGSD [31]。\n    - **核心思想**：利用自然语言描述（如“向前跑”、“向左转”）来定义技能空间中的语义距离。技能发现的目标是最大化不同技能产生的轨迹在语言嵌入空间中的距离。\n    - **改进**：将人类先验知识通过语言引入，使发现的技能具有**语义可解释性**，并与高层任务指令更易对齐。\n\n- **2. 行为偏好先验**\n    - **代表工作**：Do’s and Don’ts [17]。\n    - **核心思想**：利用示范视频（“该做什么”）和反例视频（“不该做什么”）来学习一个偏好模型，并以此作为内在奖励来引导技能发现。\n    - **改进**：使技能发现过程偏向于学习**可行、安全且符合人类期望**的行为模式，避免了危险或无效的技能。\n\n- **3. 几何对称性先验（本文的核心贡献）**\n    - **代表工作**：**Group-Invariant Skill Discovery (GISD)**。\n    - **核心思想**：识别并利用物理环境（如机器人 locomotion）中固有的**几何对称性**（如旋转、翻转）。本文证明，在群不变MDP中，标准的WDM最优解天然包含一个**等变策略**和一个**群不变评分函数**。\n    - **改进**：\n        1.  **理论创新**：提供了在对称环境下，限制搜索空间到等变策略和不变评分函数**不会损失最优性**的严格证明（**Theorem 1**）。这为方法提供了坚实的理论基础。\n        2.  **方法创新**：提出了**群不变瓦瑟斯坦依赖度量**，通过**群平均**操作显式构造群不变评分函数，并利用**群傅里叶表示**进行参数化。这确保了学到的技能表征本身编码了对称性。\n        3.  **效果提升**：\n            - **消除冗余**：避免学习仅在群变换下等价的重复技能，大幅提升**样本效率**。\n            - **提升覆盖率**：对称性约束引导技能更系统地覆盖状态空间的不同对称模式（如图4所示）。\n            - **促进泛化**：学到的傅里叶空间技能表征允许通过简单的群变换（如旋转技能向量 `z`）将技能**系统性地泛化**到新的位姿，极大提升了下游任务的适应效率（**Theorem 2**）。\n\n### 发展方向三：对称性在强化学习中的应用\n\n本文也隶属于将群等变性引入强化学习以提升效率与泛化能力的研究脉络。\n\n- **早期应用**：将等变网络（如等变CNN、SE(3)-Transformer）应用于机器人视觉和操控任务 [12, 13, 16, 49]，主要改善**感知模块**的样本效率和泛化性。\n- **深化到决策与控制**：提出**群不变MDP** [45, 46] 和**部分等变**策略 [6] 等框架，将对称性从感知扩展到**价值函数、策略和动态模型**的层面。\n- **本文的推进**：首次将群等变性系统地整合到**无监督技能发现**这一**表征学习**阶段。它不仅使用了等变策略网络，更重要的是，它设计了一个**等变的技能表征空间**（傅里叶空间），使得技能发现过程和学到的技能库本身都具有对称性。这连接了表征学习与决策控制，实现了端到端的对称性利用。\n\n### 总结脉络图\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[基础: 互信息最大化<br>DIAYN, VIC] --> B[核心框架演进: 距离最大化/WDM<br>LSD, CSD, METRA]；\n\n    B --> C1[发展方向1: 融入语言先验<br>LGSD]；\n    B --> C2[发展方向2: 融入行为偏好先验<br>Do‘s and Don’ts]；\n    B --> C3[发展方向3: 融入几何对称性先验<br>**GISD (本文)**]；\n\n    D[相关领域: 强化学习中的等变性<br>群不变MDP, 等变SAC] --> C3；\n\n    C3 -- 相比于之前所有工作 --> E[**核心改进**：<br>1. **理论保证**最优对称解存在<br>2. **方法上显式编码对称性**至技能表征<br>3. **效果上**兼顾多样性、效率与系统性泛化]；\n```\n\n**结论**：本文代表了无监督技能发现领域一个重要的范式转变——从将状态空间视为非结构化的、或依赖外部语义先验，转向**挖掘和利用环境内在的物理结构先验（对称性）**。它通过严谨的群论框架，将对称性从策略网络设计提升到了技能表征学习的目标函数层面，从而在样本效率、状态覆盖和泛化能力上实现了显著提升，为在更复杂的对称环境（如人形机器人、机械臂操作）中学习可重用技能库开辟了新路径。",

            "answer": "## 论文实验数据集、评估指标与性能提升分析\n\n### 一、 实验数据集（基准环境）\n论文在两个具有已知几何对称性的连续控制基准环境中进行了实验：\n\n1.  **状态输入环境**\n    *   **任务**： MuJoCo Ant 四足机器人平面运动。\n    *   **对称性**： 平面90°旋转对称，建模为循环群 **`C₄`**。\n    *   **关键设置**： 为了保持对称性，**未对状态输入进行观测归一化**（如运行均值/方差），以避免破坏等变性。\n\n2.  **像素输入环境**\n    *   **任务**： DeepMind Control Suite (DMC) 中的视觉四足机器人运动。\n    *   **对称性**： 水平翻转对称，建模为 **`D₁ ≅ C₂`** 群。\n    *   **关键设置**： 为了充分暴露对称性，**重新设计了地面纹理**，使其颜色从原点呈**径向变化**，从而在左右翻转下保持外观一致，同时仍能提供全局位置信息。\n\n### 二、 主要评估指标\n论文从**技能发现**和**下游任务**两个阶段进行评估：\n\n1.  **技能发现阶段：状态空间覆盖率**\n    *   **方法**： 从技能先验中均匀采样48个潜在技能向量，每个执行固定步长，收集轨迹。\n    *   **度量**： 计算智能体在任务相关平面区域 `(x, y)` 坐标上的**网格单元访问比例**。\n    *   **目的**： 量化无监督发现的技能对环境的探索广度。\n\n2.  **下游任务阶段：目标达成性能**\n    *   **任务设置**： 在冻结的底层技能策略之上，训练一个高层策略 `πʰ(z|s, g)` 来完成**多目标到达任务**。\n        *   **Ant**： 每当当前目标达成或经过K步后，在当前位置周围均匀采样新目标。\n    *   **度量**： 报告下游任务训练过程中，**平均回报随训练迭代次数的变化**。\n    *   **目的**： 评估已发现技能对于解决具体任务的有效性和可重用性。\n\n### 三、 性能提升结果\n论文将提出的 **GISD** 方法与当前最先进的无监督技能发现方法 **METRA** 进行了对比。\n\n1.  **状态空间覆盖率（技能发现效率）**\n    *   **结果**： 如图3所示，在**状态Ant**和**像素Quadruped**两个环境中，GISD都实现了**比METRA更广的状态空间覆盖率和更高的样本效率**。\n    *   **定性分析**： 可视化显示（图4），GISD发现的技能以对称一致的方式平铺平面（Ant中呈现`C₄`旋转相关，Quadruped中呈现水平翻转镜像），而METRA的技能则经常出现冗余聚类或未能覆盖所有对称模式。\n\n2.  **下游任务性能（技能实用性）**\n    *   **结果**： 如图5所示，在两个环境的下游目标到达任务中，GISD都获得了**比METRA更高的最终回报，并且以更少的环境交互步数达到强性能**。\n    *   **泛化分析**： 如图6所示，在DMC Quadruped中，对于水平镜像的目标，高层策略选择的技能向量中，**不变分量几乎相同，而等变分量呈现近似符号翻转**。这表明GISD学习的傅里叶空间技能具有多样性，并能被系统性地重用于变换后的任务。\n\n### 四、 总结\n| 方面 | 评估指标 | GISD 相比基线 (METRA) 的提升 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **技能发现** | 状态空间 `(x, y)` 覆盖率 | **更广的覆盖，更高的样本效率**。技能呈现对称一致性，无冗余。 |\n| **下游任务** | 平均回报 (多目标到达) | **更高的最终性能，更快的收敛速度**。技能支持基于群变换的系统性泛化。 |\n\n**核心结论**：通过将群不变性约束显式嵌入Wasserstein依赖度量目标，并在傅里叶空间参数化评分函数，GISD发现了与底层几何对称性对齐的技能。这些技能不仅能更有效地探索环境，而且在迁移到下游控制任务时，表现出更优的性能和泛化能力。",

            "question": "论文的主要局限性有哪些？未来可能的改进方向是什么？",
            "answer": "## 论文主要局限性分析\n\n基于对论文内容的分析，其局限性主要集中在以下几个方面：\n\n- **计算成本与实现复杂度**：论文明确指出，该方法继承了等变神经网络（equivariant networks）的常见局限，包括**增加的计算成本**。构建和优化基于群傅里叶表示的评分函数和策略，相比非结构化方法（如基线METRA）在实现上更为复杂。\n\n- **需要预先指定对称群**：方法的有效性依赖于**对环境中相关对称群（如SO(2), C₄, C₂）的先验知识**。论文假设环境动态是群不变的，并在实验中对Ant和Quadruped环境手动设定了旋转或翻转对称性。在对称性未知、不完整或动态变化的环境中，该方法可能无法直接应用或性能下降。\n\n- **对局部对称性破坏的敏感性**：尽管在状态Ant环境中使用了Partially Equivariant SAC来增强鲁棒性，但方法本质上依赖于环境动态的严格群不变性假设。现实机器人环境常存在**微小的不对称性**（如接触力不对称、传感器偏差、非均匀摩擦），这些可能破坏理想的对称性，影响技能发现和泛化效果。\n\n- **实验环境的局限性**：实验验证集中在具有**明确、全局几何对称性**的连续控制 locomotion 任务（Ant, Quadruped）上。论文在结论中指出，尚未在更具挑战性的领域（如Humanoid控制）或对称性更复杂、更局部的任务（如精细操作）上进行测试，其普适性有待进一步证明。\n\n- **技能表示的设计选择**：在实验中，为了与基线公平比较，对技能维度（如Quadruped中拼接两个傅里叶特征向量）和强调的表示分量（如Ant中仅使用频率-1的C₄不可约表示）做出了特定设计选择。这些选择可能**并非最优**，且需要针对不同任务进行调整。\n\n## 未来可能的改进方向\n\n论文在结论和未来展望部分提出了以下潜在发展方向：\n\n- **扩展到更复杂和实际的任务领域**：\n    - **挑战性控制任务**：如Humanoid等更复杂的高维动力学系统。\n    - **机器人操作任务**：论文明确指出，操作任务中技能发现 notoriously difficult，但通常存在丰富的对称性（如抓取、放置中的旋转、平移对称），是未来应用的**重要方向**。\n\n- **增强方法的自适应性**：\n    - **自动对称性发现**：未来工作可以探索如何**从数据中自动推断或学习环境的对称群结构**，减少对先验知识的依赖。\n    - **处理部分或近似对称性**：开发能**鲁棒地处理局部对称性破坏**的算法，例如通过更灵活的 partial equivariance 框架或学习对不对称因素不变的表示。\n\n- **深化对称性在下游任务中的利用**：\n    - **规划与策略学习**：更直接地利用已发现技能的对称结构来**加速下游任务的规划和高层策略学习**。例如，利用对称性进行数据增强、构建对称性感知的规划算法。\n\n- **算法与理论的进一步拓展**：\n    - **探索其他对称群**：当前工作主要关注连续/离散旋转和翻转对称。可扩展到更一般的群，如**欧几里得群E(n)**、缩放对称群等。\n    - **与其他先验的融合**：将几何对称性先验与**其他形式的先验**（如论文提到的语言指导、行为偏好）相结合，以发现更丰富、更可控的技能。\n\n- **降低计算与实现门槛**：\n    - 开发更高效的群表示参数化方法或近似算法，以**降低计算开销**，促进在更大规模或实时系统中的应用。\n\n总而言之，该论文在**理论创新**（证明了对称最优解的存在性并构建了群不变WDM）和**实际价值**（在locomotion任务上提升了样本效率与泛化能力）上贡献显著，但其应用范围受限于对称性假设和实现复杂度。未来的工作核心在于**突破这些限制**，使对称性感知的技能发现方法能应用于更广泛、更复杂的现实世界机器人学习问题。",
