While recent studies on reasoning VLAs show that explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) can improve generalization, they suffer from high inference latency due to lengthy reasoning traces. We propose Fast-ThinkAct, an efficient reasoning framework that achieves compact yet performant planning through verbalizable latent reasoning. Fast-ThinkAct learns to reason efficiently with latent CoTs by distilling from a teacher, driven by a preference-guided objective to align manipulation trajectories that transfers both linguistic and visual planning capabilities for embodied control. This enables reasoning-enhanced policy learning that effectively connects compact reasoning to action execution. Extensive experiments across diverse embodied manipulation and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-ThinkAct achieves strong performance with up to 89.3% reduced inference latency over state-of-the-art reasoning VLAs, while maintaining effective long-horizon planning, few-shot adaptation, and failure recovery.\nLinks:\nProject Page\n\\abscontent\n1\nIntroduction\nFigure 1\n:\nOverview of Fast-ThinkAct.\nPrevious reasoning VLAs generate lengthy reasoning traces (\n∼\n\\sim\n250 tokens). Our approach learns compact continuous tokens (e.g., 6) (\nblue\n) and parallel spatial tokens (\ngreen\n) as internal reasoning. The bottom-right plot shows that we achieve\n9.3\n×\n9.3\\times\nfaster inference than ThinkAct-7B\nhuang2025thinkact\n, while delivering improved performance on the SimplerEnv-Google benchmark.\nRecent large vision-language models (VLMs)\nliu2023visual\n;\ncomanici2025gemini\n;\nliu2024nvila\n;\nbai2025qwen2\n;\nshi2024eagle\n;\nli2025eagle\n;\nchen2025eagle\n;\nwang2025internvl3\n;\nxie2024show\nhave achieved remarkable capabilities in visual-language understanding across diverse multimodal tasks. To extend these capabilities to embodied-centric tasks, recent works leverage large-scale robot demonstrations\no2024open\nto develop Vision-Language-Action (VLA) foundation models\nbrohan2022rt\n;\nbrohan2023rt\n;\nteam2024octo\n;\nbjorck2025gr00t\n;\nli2025hamster\n;\nblack2024pi_0\n;\nyang2025magma\n;\nkim24openvla\n. These VLA tasks require agents to perceive complex visual scenes, reason over spatial and temporal contexts, and execute adaptive actions within dynamic environments, demanding robust long-horizon planning and contextual adaptation. However, as these VLA models primarily rely on supervised training from action data, they excel at basic skills (e.g., pick-and-place) but struggle to generalize beyond training distributions, such as long-horizon planning, self-correction from failures, and adaptation to novel scenarios, due to the impracticality of collecting exhaustive robot demonstrations.\nReasoning VLAs\nzawalski2024robotic\n;\nzhao2025cot\n;\nlee2025molmoact\n;\nwu2025you\n;\nqu2025eo\n;\nhuang2025thinkact\n;\nkim2025robot\naddress these limitations by incorporating intermediate thinking processes, improving generalization and task-solving capability. Supervised chain-of-thought (CoT) methods\nzawalski2024robotic\n;\nzhao2025cot\n;\nlee2025molmoact\n;\nqu2025eo\naddress this by learning from intermediate reasoning annotations. These approaches can be categorized into textual reasoning methods that leverage off-the-shelf LLMs and VLMs to generate pseudo CoT labels\nzawalski2024robotic\n, and visual reasoning methods that generate structured visual reasoning representations such as sub-goal images, image depth, and 2D visual traces\nzhao2025cot\n;\nlee2025molmoact\n. However, these supervised approaches require substantial reasoning annotations and remain limited by training data coverage. To address this, ThinkAct\nhuang2025thinkact\nemploys RL-based reasoning\nshao2024deepseekmath\nto generate long textual CoTs guided by action-aligned visual rewards. While these reasoning methods effectively improve task generalization and planning capabilities, they require generating lengthy chain-of-thought steps that introduce substantial reasoning latency, which hampers embodied applications with\nreal-time\nrequirements.\nIn embodied AI applications such as robotic manipulation and autonomous driving, agents must make rapid decisions at high frequencies (e.g., 1-15 Hz)\nguan2025efficient\n. However, generating lengthy reasoning traces can take several seconds per decision (e.g., 0.1 Hz)\nhuang2025thinkact\n;\nlee2025molmoact\n, creating a critical bottleneck that limits real-time performance\nguan2025efficient\n;\nyu2025survey\nand poses safety risks in time-critical scenarios\nwang2025alpamayo\n. To mitigate this efficiency bottleneck while preserving reasoning capabilities, very recent works\nchen2025training\n;\nyu2025survey\n;\nguan2025efficient\nhave explored approaches to reduce inference latency in embodied reasoning. For instance, ECoT-Lite\nchen2025training\nproposes reasoning dropout to accelerate inference, yet directly reducing textual reasoning length risks performance degradation due to critical information loss. How to preserve reasoning capability while enabling compact representations that properly capture essential spatial-temporal dynamics remains a crucial challenge for reasoning VLA models.\nIn this paper, we propose\nFast-ThinkAct\n, an efficient embodied reasoning framework for Vision-Language-Action tasks that achieves compact yet expressive planning through verbalizable latent reasoning. As depicted in Figure\n1\n, unlike prior reasoning VLAs that generate lengthy explicit textual CoT traces, we introduce reward-guided preference distillation with visual trajectory alignment to compress linguistic and visual planning into compact continuous latents that enable implicit internal reasoning. Our student VLM encodes reasoning into compact latents decodable by a verbalizer, enabling preference-based optimization that leverages RL-derived reward signals to distill high-quality reasoning patterns from a textual teacher VLM while suppressing low-quality ones. We further align trajectory latents between teacher and student to transfer visual planning capabilities essential for embodied control. Once trained, the student VLM enables reasoning-enhanced policy learning that bridges implicit multimodal planning with action execution, achieving significantly faster inference while outperforming existing reasoning VLAs.\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows:\n•\nWe propose\nFast-ThinkAct\n, an efficient reasoning framework that compresses reasoning into verbalizable latent thoughts while maintaining expressive planning abilities.\n•\nWe introduce preference-guided distillation with manipulation trajectory alignment that compresses linguistic and visual planning into compact continuous latents.\n•\nWe bridge high-level visual planning to low-level action execution through reasoning-enhanced policy learning guided by manipulation trajectory latents.\n•\nWe achieve up to 89.3% inference latency reduction over state-of-the-art reasoning VLAs while maintaining strong performance across diverse embodied benchmarks.\n2\nRelated Works\n2.1\nVision-Language-Action (VLA) Models\nFoundation VLAs.\nVision-Language-Action (VLA) models\nbrohan2022rt\n;\nbrohan2023rt\n;\nteam2024octo\n;\nbjorck2025gr00t\n;\nli2025hamster\n;\nblack2024pi_0\n;\nyang2025magma\n;\npertsch2025fast\n;\ndriess2025knowledge\n;\nbu2025agibot\n;\nteam2025gemini\n;\nwang2025vla\nhave recently emerged as a promising paradigm for embodied AI by training vision-language backbones on large-scale robot demonstrations. Works such as OpenVLA\nkim24openvla\nand\nπ\n0\n\\pi_{0}\nblack2024pi_0\nachieve language-conditioned manipulation through end-to-end policy learning, while Magma\nyang2025magma\nco-trains on heterogeneous human and robot data. HAMSTER\nli2025hamster\nand TraceVLA\nzheng2024tracevla\nfurther leverage 2D visual trajectories to boost spatial-action connections. Despite success on routine manipulation, these imitation-based approaches struggle with long-horizon planning and generalization to novel scenarios due to limited training data coverage.\nReasoning VLAs.\nTo overcome these limitations, recent works\nzawalski2024robotic\n;\nzhao2025cot\n;\nlee2025molmoact\n;\nwu2025you\n;\nqu2025eo\n;\nhuang2025thinkact\n;\nkim2025robot\n;\nyuan2025embodied\n;\nabdolmaleki2025gemini\nintegrate explicit reasoning mechanisms into VLA architectures. Supervised approaches\nzawalski2024robotic\n;\nzhao2025cot\n;\nlee2025molmoact\n;\nqu2025eo\nintroduce intermediate reasoning through chain-of-thought annotations. Embodied CoT\nzawalski2024robotic\nand Hi-Robot\nshi2025hi\nsynthesize reasoning labels via pretrained foundation models. To perform vision-centric reasoning\nman2025argus\n;\nsarch2025grounded\nbeyond pure text, CoT-VLA\nzhao2025cot\nemploys visual goal generation and MolmoAct\nlee2025molmoact\nstructures reasoning by spatial representations. Additionally, EO-1\nqu2025eo\nintroduces interleaved vision-language-action pre-training to bridge reasoning and interaction. Recent works\nyuan2025embodied\n;\nhuang2025thinkact\nalternatively leverage reinforcement fine-tuning to generate reasoning chains with designed rewards. Despite improved generalization, these reasoning VLAs suffer from high inference latency and inevitably introduce extraneous information that degrades action quality.\n2.2\nEfficient Reasoning\nTo address the inference latency of reasoning, recent LLM research explores various efficiency techniques\nlee2025vlsi\n;\ndai2025stable\n;\nyuan2025efficient\n;\nxiang2025just\n;\naggarwal2025l1\n;\nlee2025unified\n. For example, RL-based approaches\ndai2025stable\n;\nyuan2025efficient\n;\nxiang2025just\n;\naggarwal2025l1\nintroduce length penalties to encourage shorter reasoning chains, though such methods can suffer from training instability. Beyond length control, latent reasoning methods\nhao2024training\n;\nshen2025codi\n;\nzhang2025soft\n;\ncheng2024compressed\n;\nxu2025softcot\nenable reasoning in continuous spaces, such as Coconut\nhao2024training\nusing hidden states as continuous thoughts, CODI\nshen2025codi\ndistilling explicit CoT into continuous space via teacher-student alignment, and Soft Thinking\nzhang2025soft\ngenerating weighted concept tokens. However, these LLM techniques cannot directly transfer to VLA tasks due to the need for spatial-temporal understanding and bridging semantic reasoning with embodied control.\nRecently, ECoT-Lite\nchen2025training\nproposes reasoning dropout to accelerate embodied reasoning by skipping test-time reasoning traces. However, reasoning dropout can lead to inconsistent planning as it builds on supervised embodied CoT. Our proposed Fast-ThinkAct distills reasoning into compact latent representations that naturally encode multimodal information, enabling robust reasoning-enhanced policy learning.\n3\nMethod\nFigure 2\n:\nOverview of Fast-ThinkAct.\n(a) Given observation\no\nt\no_{t}\nand instruction\nl\nl\n, the Textual Teacher VLM\nℱ\nθ\nT\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}^{T}\ngenerates explicit reasoning chains. The Latent Student VLM\nℱ\nθ\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}\ndistills these into compact latent tokens\n𝐳\n\\mathbf{z}\nguided by reward preferences. Verbalizer LLM\n𝒱\nψ\n\\mathcal{V}_{\\psi}\ndecodes latents to text for preference-based learning via\nℒ\nverb\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{verb}}\n, while\nℒ\ndistill\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{distill}}\ntransfers visual planning capability from teacher, and spatial tokens enable parallel visual trajectory prediction via\nℒ\nans\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{ans}}\n, ensuring latents are verbalizable and grounded in visual planning. (b) Reasoning-Enhanced Policy Learning. The Action Model\nπ\nϕ\n\\pi_{\\phi}\nis trained with\nℒ\nIL\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{IL}}\nwhile freezing the latent student\nℱ\nθ\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}\nand state encoder.\n3.1\nProblem Formulation\nWe first define the setting and notations. At each timestep\nt\nt\n, given a language instruction\nl\nl\n, the model observes a visual input\no\nt\no_{t}\nand generates an action chunk\na\nt\na_{t}\n, represented as a sequence of continuous robot control vectors (e.g., 7- or 14-DOF for single- or bimanual robots, respectively).\nTo address this problem, we propose Fast-ThinkAct, an efficient reasoning framework that bridges high-level planning with low-level action execution. Our approach employs a VLM\nℱ\nθ\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}\nto perform reasoning in\ncontinuous latent space\n, integrated with an action model\nπ\nϕ\n\\pi_{\\phi}\nfor executable action generation. Specifically,\nℱ\nθ\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}\nprocesses observation-instruction pairs\n(\no\nt\n,\nl\n)\n(o_{t},l)\nthrough latent chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to produce a compact visual plan latent\nc\nt\nc_{t}\nthat encapsulates the intended trajectory in visual space (Sec.\n3.2\n). This\nc\nt\nc_{t}\nsubsequently guides\nπ\nϕ\n\\pi_{\\phi}\nto predict executable actions\na\nt\na_{t}\n(Sec.\n3.3\n). By distilling reasoning into a continuous latent space rather than discrete text, Fast-ThinkAct achieves significantly improved inference efficiency while enhancing action performance through better preservation of spatial and visual information.\n3.2\nEfficient Embodied Reasoning\nTo enable efficient embodied reasoning that meets the real-time requirements of embodied AI tasks, we aim to compress long textual CoTs into a compact set of continuous latent representations. However, compressing reasoning traces into latents is challenging, as there is no direct supervision signal in the latent space to guide what reasoning patterns should be encoded.\n3.2.1\nVerbalizable Latent CoT by Reward Preferences\nTo address this challenge, we propose to perform distillation in natural language space by introducing a verbalizer LLM that decodes latents into verbalizable reasoning. This approach grounds latent learning in an interpretable textual form, ensuring that the learned latents faithfully preserve the underlying reasoning structure. Since reasoning traces generated by the teacher model\nℱ\nθ\nT\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}^{T}\nexhibit varying quality, we adopt a preference-based learning framework that exploits reward signals from the teacher’s GRPO training to guide the latent student\nℱ\nθ\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}\ntoward high-quality reasoning patterns while suppressing low-quality ones.\nSpecifically, we employ a teacher-student framework where a textual teacher model\nℱ\nθ\nT\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}^{T}\nfirst learns explicit reasoning through GRPO\nshao2024deepseekmath\ntraining by maximizing:\n𝒥\nGRPO\n​\n(\nθ\n)\n=\n𝔼\nτ\n∼\nℱ\nθ\nT\n​\n[\nmin\n⁡\n(\nr\nθ\n​\n(\nτ\n)\n​\nA\n​\n(\nτ\n)\n,\nclip\n​\n(\nr\nθ\n​\n(\nτ\n)\n,\n1\n−\nϵ\n,\n1\n+\nϵ\n)\n​\nA\n​\n(\nτ\n)\n)\n]\n,\n\\mathcal{J}_{\\text{GRPO}}(\\theta)=\\mathbb{E}_{\\tau\\sim\\mathcal{F}^{T}_{\\theta}}\\Big[\\min\\big(r_{\\theta}(\\tau)A(\\tau),\\text{clip}(r_{\\theta}(\\tau),1-\\epsilon,1+\\epsilon)A(\\tau)\\big)\\Big],\n(1)\nwhere\nτ\n\\tau\ndenotes a reasoning trace and\nr\nθ\n​\n(\nτ\n)\n=\nℱ\nθ\nT\n​\n(\nτ\n)\nℱ\nold\nT\n​\n(\nτ\n)\nr_{\\theta}(\\tau)=\\frac{\\mathcal{F}^{T}_{\\theta}(\\tau)}{\\mathcal{F}^{T}_{\\text{old}}(\\tau)}\nis the probability ratio. The advantage function for group rewards\n{\nR\ni\n}\ni\n∈\nG\n​\n(\nτ\n)\n\\{R_{i}\\}_{i\\in G(\\tau)}\nis represented as:\nA\n​\n(\nτ\n)\n=\nR\nτ\n−\nmean\n​\n(\n{\nR\ni\n}\ni\n∈\nG\n​\n(\nτ\n)\n)\nstd\n​\n(\n{\nR\ni\n}\ni\n∈\nG\n​\n(\nτ\n)\n)\n.\nA(\\tau)=\\frac{R_{\\tau}-\\text{mean}(\\{R_{i}\\}_{i\\in G(\\tau)})}{\\text{std}(\\{R_{i}\\}_{i\\in G(\\tau)})}.\n(2)\nThis training process produces textual CoTs with varying quality, where the advantage function\nA\n​\n(\nτ\n)\nA(\\tau)\nnaturally serves as a quality indicator. To construct preference pairs for distillation, we select the highest and lowest advantage traces from each rollout group:\nτ\n+\n=\narg\n⁡\nmax\nτ\n∈\nG\n⁡\nA\n​\n(\nτ\n)\n​\nand\n​\nτ\n−\n=\narg\n⁡\nmin\nτ\n∈\nG\n⁡\nA\n​\n(\nτ\n)\n.\n\\displaystyle\\tau^{+}=\\arg\\max_{\\tau\\in G}A(\\tau)\\text{ and }\\tau^{-}=\\arg\\min_{\\tau\\in G}A(\\tau).\n(3)\nInstead of generating textual tokens, the student model\nℱ\nθ\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}\nperforms latent reasoning by autoregressively generating\nM\nM\ncontinuous latent vectors\n𝐳\n=\n{\nz\nm\n}\nm\n=\n1\nM\n\\mathbf{z}=\\{z_{m}\\}_{m=1}^{M}\nwith\nz\nm\n∈\nℝ\nd\nz_{m}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d}\n, where\nd\nd\nis the hidden size. We then train the verbalizer LLM\n𝒱\nψ\n\\mathcal{V}_{\\psi}\nto decode these latents\n𝐳\n\\mathbf{z}\ninto natural language. The training objective encourages the verbalizer to assign a higher likelihood to decoding latents into high-quality reasoning\nτ\n+\n\\tau^{+}\nthan low-quality reasoning\nτ\n−\n\\tau^{-}\n. Inspired by DPO\nrafailov2023direct\n, we formulate this as an optimization guided by the reward preferences:\nℒ\nverb\n=\n−\n𝔼\n​\n[\nlog\n⁡\nσ\n​\n(\nβ\n​\n(\nlog\n⁡\np\nψ\n​\n(\nτ\n+\n∣\n𝐳\n)\np\nref\n​\n(\nτ\n+\n)\n−\nlog\n⁡\np\nψ\n​\n(\nτ\n−\n∣\n𝐳\n)\np\nref\n​\n(\nτ\n−\n)\n)\n)\n]\n,\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{verb}}=-\\mathbb{E}\\Big[\\log\\sigma\\Big(\\beta\\big(\\log\\tfrac{p_{\\psi}(\\tau^{+}\\mid\\mathbf{z})}{p_{\\text{ref}}(\\tau^{+})}-\\log\\tfrac{p_{\\psi}(\\tau^{-}\\mid\\mathbf{z})}{p_{\\text{ref}}(\\tau^{-})}\\big)\\Big)\\Big],\n(4)\nwhere\np\nref\np_{\\text{ref}}\nis the reference model (i.e.,\n𝒱\nψ\n\\mathcal{V}_{\\psi}\nwithout latent conditioning),\nσ\n\\sigma\nis the sigmoid function, and\nβ\n=\n0.1\n\\beta=0.1\ncontrols preference strength. This encourages the student VLM\nℱ\nθ\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}\nto encode latents that the verbalizer decodes into high-quality reasoning while suppressing low-quality patterns.\n3.2.2\nAction-Aligned Visual Plan Distillation\nWhile the verbalizer loss (Eq.\n4\n) enables the student\nℱ\nθ\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}\nto capture high-level reasoning patterns, it does not explicitly ensure that latent representations encode the visual planning capability crucial for embodied control. To address this, we introduce action-aligned visual plan distillation to transfer the teacher\nℱ\nθ\nT\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}^{T}\n’s spatial reasoning ability to the student\nℱ\nθ\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}\n.\nWe distill spatial reasoning from the teacher, which is trained with trajectory-level rewards (e.g., goal completion and trajectory alignment\nhuang2025thinkact\n) for grounded visual planning. We align the trajectory-level representations by minimizing the L2 distance between hidden states of the\n<answer>\ntoken that encodes the visual plan:\nℒ\ndistill\n=\n‖\nh\nt\nT\n−\nh\nt\n‖\n2\n2\n,\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{distill}}=\\|h_{t}^{T}-h_{t}\\|_{2}^{2},\n(5)\nwhere\nh\nt\nT\nh_{t}^{T}\nand\nh\nt\nh_{t}\nare the hidden states from teacher (corresponding to\nτ\n+\n\\tau^{+}\n) and student, respectively.\nTo enable efficient parallel trajectory prediction, unlike the textual teacher that autoregressively generates verbose text sequences of waypoints\n{\np\nk\n}\nk\n=\n1\nK\n\\{p_{k}\\}_{k=1}^{K}\nwith\np\nk\n∈\n[\n0\n,\n1\n]\n2\np_{k}\\in[0,1]^{2}\n(tokenized into 60-70 tokens when\nK\n=\n5\nK=5\n), the student uses\nK\nK\nlearnable spatial tokens\n{\n𝐬\ni\n}\ni\n=\n1\nK\n\\{\\mathbf{s}_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{K}\nappended to the reasoning latent sequence, with each output hidden state simultaneously projected to a waypoint via an MLP. The total objective for training\nℱ\nθ\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}\ncombines all three components:\nℒ\nstudent\n\\displaystyle\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{student}}\n=\nℒ\nverb\n+\nℒ\ndistill\n+\nℒ\nans\n,\nwhere\n\\displaystyle=\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{verb}}+\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{distill}}+\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{ans}},\\quad\\text{where }\n(6)\nℒ\nans\n\\displaystyle\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{ans}}\n=\n∑\ni\n=\n1\nK\n‖\np\ni\n−\np\n^\ni\n‖\n2\n2\n,\nwith\n​\np\ni\n=\nMLP\n​\n(\nh\n′\n​\n(\n𝐬\ni\n)\n)\n,\n\\displaystyle=\\sum_{i=1}^{K}\\|p_{i}-\\hat{p}_{i}\\|_{2}^{2},\\text{ with }p_{i}=\\text{MLP}(h^{\\prime}(\\mathbf{s}_{i})),\nwhere\nh\n′\n​\n(\n𝐬\ni\n)\nh^{\\prime}(\\mathbf{s}_{i})\ndenotes the output hidden state of the\ni\ni\n-th spatial token and\np\n^\ni\n\\hat{p}_{i}\nare ground-truth waypoints. Through this unified framework, the student model\nℱ\nθ\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}\nperforms compact yet expressive latent reasoning and generates visual trajectory plans efficiently.\n3.3\nReasoning-Enhanced Policy Learning\nAfter the student VLM\nℱ\nθ\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}\nperforms compact latent reasoning and generates visual trajectory planning through spatial tokens, we leverage these representations to guide a diffusion Transformer-based action model\nπ\nϕ\n\\pi_{\\phi}\n(e.g., RDT\nliu2024rdt\n) for action prediction. To bridge the high-level visual planning with low-level action generation, we connect the visual latent planning\nc\nt\nc_{t}\nencoded in the key-value cache corresponding to the spatial tokens to the action model.\nSpecifically, we extract visual latent planning\nc\nt\nc_{t}\nfrom the KV cache of spatial tokens in earlier VLM layers (since\nℱ\nθ\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}\nhas more layers than\nπ\nϕ\n\\pi_{\\phi}\n) and concatenate with KV pairs from the action model’s state encoder. The action model’s cross-attention then attends to both the visual planning context and state observations. We post-train on action-annotated robot data by\nfreezing\nℱ\nθ\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}\nand the state encoder while updating only\nπ\nϕ\n\\pi_{\\phi}\nwith the imitation learning objective:\nℒ\nIL\n​\n(\nϕ\n)\n=\nℓ\n​\n(\nπ\nϕ\n​\n(\no\nt\n,\nl\n,\nc\nt\n)\n,\na\n^\nt\n)\n,\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{IL}}(\\phi)=\\ell\\left(\\pi_{\\phi}(o_{t},l,c_{t}),\\hat{a}_{t}\\right),\n(7)\nwhere\nℓ\n\\ell\ndenotes the denoising objective for diffusion policy and\na\n^\nt\n\\hat{a}_{t}\nis the ground-truth action. Through this post-training, the action model effectively translates visual planning from compact latent reasoning into low-level robot actions.\nFigure 3\n:\nEvaluation of robot manipulation and reasoning efficiency.\n(a)-(e) Success rates on LIBERO\nliu2023libero\nand SimplerEnv\nli24simpler\nbenchmarks compared with state-of-the-art 7B reasoning VLAs.

Our approach achieves up to 89.3% inference latency reduction while maintaining superior task success rates.\n3.4\nLearning Strategy and Inference\nTraining Strategy.\nWe initialize both teacher\nℱ\nθ\nT\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}^{T}\nand student\nℱ\nθ\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}\nfrom the same checkpoint obtained through SFT and CoT-SFT on a pre-trained VLM. The teacher is trained with GRPO using action-aligned rewards\nhuang2025thinkact\n, while the student is trained with\nℒ\nstudent\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{student}}\nto compress reasoning into compact latents.

The teacher is optimized with GRPO\nshao2024deepseekmath\nusing action-aligned visual rewards\nhuang2025thinkact\nand QA-style rewards (detailed in supplementary material). For the first 3,000 iterations of the student training, we train the verbalizer\n𝒱\nψ\n\\mathcal{V}_{\\psi}\nwith standard language modeling loss, then switch to\nℒ\nverb\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{verb}}\nfor the remaining 1,500 iterations. For reasoning-enhanced policy learning, we initialize\nπ\nϕ\n\\pi_{\\phi}\nfrom DiT-Policy\nchi2023diffusion\npre-trained on OXE\no2024open\nfor SimplerEnv, and from RDT\nliu2024rdt\nfor LIBERO and RoboTwin2.0. A linear projection adapts the VLM’s KV cache to the action model dimension (1,024 for DiT-Policy and 2,048 for RDT). Training runs for 20K iterations with batch size 256 and learning rate\n1\n​\ne\n−\n4\n1\\text{e}{-4}\n. All diffusion hyperparameters follow those of the respective action models. All experiments are conducted on 16 NVIDIA A100 GPUs with 80 GB memory.\nTraining Datasets and Evaluation Benchmarks.\nFor reasoning VLM training, we utilize single-arm visual trajectories labeled by\nlee2025molmoact\nand dual-arm visual trajectories from the AIST dataset\naist2025aist\n, along with QA tasks from PixMo\ndeitke2024molmo\n, RoboFAC\nlu2025robofac\n, RoboVQA\nsermanet2024robovqa\n, ShareRobot\nji2025robobrain\n, EgoPlan\nchen2023egoplan\n, and Video-R1\nfeng2025video\n. For reasoning-enhanced policy learning, we use action data from the OXE dataset\no2024open\n(following OpenVLA\nkim24openvla\n) when training with DiT-Policy, and augment with bimanual data from the static Aloha dataset\nshi2023waypoint\n;\nzhao2023learning\nwhen training with RDT.\nWe evaluate Fast-ThinkAct on four embodied reasoning benchmarks and three robot manipulation benchmarks. For embodied reasoning, we use EgoPlan-Bench2\nqiu2024egoplan2\n(accuracy on multiple-choice questions), RoboVQA\nsermanet2024robovqa\n(BLEU score\npapineni2002bleu\n), OpenEQA\nmajumdar2024openeqa\n, and RoboFAC\nlu2025robofac\n(both using LLM-based scoring). Notably, RoboVQA and RoboFAC contain videos captured from real robots. For robot manipulation, we evaluate on SimplerEnv\nli24simpler\n, which demonstrates strong correlation with real-world performance, LIBERO\nliu2023libero\ncovering diverse manipulation tasks including long-horizon scenarios, and RoboTwin2.0\nchen2025robotwin2\nfor complex bimanual manipulation. All robot manipulation tasks use task success rate as the metric.

LIBERO covers diverse subtasks, including Spatial, Object, Goal, and Long, while SimplerEnv provides a simulated benchmark with strong real-world correlation, featuring variations in lighting, object appearance, and camera viewpoints. As shown in Fig.\n3\n(a)-(e), Fast-ThinkAct consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving the highest success rates across all LIBERO subtasks and SimplerEnv-Google. This includes substantial improvements over foundation VLAs such as OpenVLA\nkim24openvla\n, and reasoning VLAs including CoT-VLA\nzhao2025cot\n, ThinkAct\nhuang2025thinkact\n, and MolmoAct\nlee2025molmoact\n. Moreover, as shown in Fig.\n3\n(f), our compact latent reasoning achieves 89.3% and 88.0% latency reduction compared to ThinkAct-7B\nhuang2025thinkact\nand MolmoAct-7B\nlee2025molmoact\nrespectively, and\n7\n×\n7\\times\nfaster inference than ThinkAct-3B, demonstrating substantial efficiency gains without sacrificing performance.\nTo further validate Fast-ThinkAct on more complex scenarios, we evaluate on RoboTwin2.0\nchen2025robotwin2\n, a challenging bimanual manipulation benchmark requiring long-horizon planning. As shown in Tab.\n1\n, Fast-ThinkAct significantly outperforms previous VLAs including DP\nchi2023diffusion\n, ACT\nzhao2023learning\n,\nπ\n0\n\\pi_{0}\nblack2024pi_0\n, RDT\nliu2024rdt\n, and ThinkAct\nhuang2025thinkact\nacross both easy and hard settings. Compared to RDT, Fast-ThinkAct achieves 9.3% and 3.6% higher success rates on easy and hard settings, respectively. Against the reasoning VLA ThinkAct, it improves success by 3.3% and 1.7% while maintaining substantially higher efficiency, as shown in Fig.\n3\n(f). These results demonstrate that our compact reasoning design enables both superior accuracy and computational efficiency on complex bimanual manipulation tasks.\nEmbodied Reasoning.\nIn Tab.\n2\n, we evaluate the reasoning capabilities of Fast-ThinkAct in embodied scenarios across three benchmarks: EgoPlan-Bench2\nqiu2024egoplan2\n, RoboVQA\nsermanet2024robovqa\n, and OpenEQA\nmajumdar2024openeqa\n. These benchmarks assess multi-step planning in egocentric everyday scenarios, long-horizon reasoning for robotic manipulation tasks, and zero-shot understanding of embodied scenes in diverse environments, respectively. We observed that, Fast-ThinkAct surpasses all comparison methods, including two proprietary models (i.e., GPT-4V\nachiam2023gpt\nand Gemini-2.5-Flash\ncomanici2025gemini\n), exceeding the runner-up by 2.4% on EgoPlan-Bench2, 5.5 BLEU score on RoboVQA, and 1.1 points on OpenEQA. These results demonstrate that Fast-ThinkAct effectively handles complex planning sequences and extended reasoning horizons while generalizing to novel environments, showcasing robust capabilities for scene comprehension and multi-step task execution in embodied AI applications.\nFigure 4\n:\nVisualization of predicted visual trajectories and action execution results on long-horizon tasks.\nExamples from (a) SimplerEnv-Google, (b) LIBERO-Long, and (c) RoboTwin2.0-Hard with long (278) steps. Yellow traces indicate single-arm/left gripper trajectories; red traces indicate right gripper trajectories for bimanual tasks.\nFigure 5\n:\nFailure recovery capability on RoboFAC\nlu2025robofac\n.\nLeft: Qualitative examples (from both simulation and real robot) of corrective guidance for manipulation errors. Right: Quantitative evaluation on simulation (RoboFAC-Sim) and real-robot (RoboFAC-Real) settings.\n4.3\nAnalysis of Fast-ThinkAct\nReasoning Enables Long-Horizon Planning.\nFigure 6\n:\nFew-shot adaptation results on RoboTwin2.0 benchmark.\nWe use 10 demonstrations per task for fine-tuning.\nWe analyze Fast-ThinkAct’s capability on long-horizon tasks in Tab.\n1\nand Fig.\n4\n. We focus on long-horizon tasks (average length exceeding 270 steps) in RoboTwin2.0\nchen2025robotwin2\nthat require multi-step reasoning and extended planning horizons. As shown in Tab.\n1\n, Fast-ThinkAct achieves average scores of 48.8 and 16.8 on easy and hard settings of long-horizon tasks, respectively, surpassing RDT (35.0/12.3) and ThinkAct (42.8/15.3). Fig.\n4\nvisualizes predicted 2D visual traces and execution results on representative tasks from SimplerEnv-Google\nli24simpler\n, LIBERO-Long\nliu2023libero\n, and RoboTwin2.0\nchen2025robotwin2\n. For example, the LIBERO-Long task requires sequentially turning on the stove and placing a moka pot on it, while the RoboTwin2.0 handover task requires bimanual coordination to transfer a block between grippers. The visual traces successfully predict feasible solution paths, with their corresponding representations serving as visual planning guidance for successful execution. These results demonstrate that our compact latent reasoning effectively supports long-horizon planning in complex manipulation scenarios.\nReasoning Enables Failure Recovery.\nFigure 7\n:\nReasoning trace comparison on RoboVQA.\n(a) Teacher’s textual reasoning. (b) Student’s verbalized latent reasoning.\nGreen\n: relevant content;\norange\n: less relevant content.\nA key advantage of reasoning-based VLAs\nhuang2025thinkact\n;\nabdolmaleki2025gemini\nis their ability to identify runtime failures and provide corrective guidance for recovery. To evaluate this capability, we conduct experiments on RoboFAC\nlu2025robofac\n, a benchmark specifically designed to assess failure identification and correction in embodied VLMs. As shown in Fig.\n5\n, Fast-ThinkAct substantially outperforms the second-best baseline RoboFAC-3B\nlu2025robofac\nby 10.9 points on the simulation split and 16.4 points on the real-world split. The qualitative examples demonstrate Fast-ThinkAct’s ability to reason over manipulation videos, identify failures, and propose recovery steps. For instance, in the right example where the target object drops mid-execution, Fast-ThinkAct generates a concrete recovery plan: first moving the arm backward to create space, then adjusting laterally to align with the target object, and finally lowering to the appropriate height for a secure grasp. These results demonstrate that our latent reasoning supports both fast task execution and crucial failure analysis capabilities essential for robust robotic manipulation.\nReasoning Enables Few-Shot Adaptation.\nTable 3\n:\nAblation study of training objectives and learning stages.\nNote that Fast-ThinkAct w/o\nℒ\nverb\n,\nℒ\ndistill\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{verb}},\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{distill}}\ndenotes the student VLM\nℱ\nθ\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}\ntrained without the corresponding loss components.\nMethod\nEgoPlan\nRoboVQA\nOpenEQA\nAverage\nFast-ThinkAct\n46.4\n60.8\n51.2\n52.8\nw/o\nℒ\nverb\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{verb}}\n42.1\n53.8\n49.5\n48.5\nw/o\nℒ\nverb\n,\nℒ\ndistill\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{verb}},\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{distill}}\n41.6\n52.7\n48.9\n47.7\nTextual Teacher\nℱ\nθ\nT\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}^{T}\n41.7\n58.2\n49.4\n49.8\nSFT + CoT-SFT\n40.0\n46.1\n48.8\n45.0\nSFT only\n40.5\n53.6\n45.3\n46.5\nTo assess how reasoning capability improves few-shot adaptation, we conduct few-shot experiments on the RoboTwin2.0 benchmark\nchen2025robotwin2\n, fine-tuning models using only 10 demonstrations per task. As illustrated in Fig.\n6\n, Fast-ThinkAct significantly enhances our adopted action model RDT\nliu2024rdt\nand outperforms the state-of-the-art VLAs, including\nπ\n0\n\\pi_{0}\nblack2024pi_0\nand ThinkAct\nhuang2025thinkact\non both medium and long-horizon tasks. Notably, our method achieves these gains while operating with significantly lower reasoning latency compared to ThinkAct, highlighting the advantage of efficient yet effective reasoning for few-shot action adaptation in complex robot manipulation scenarios.\nVisualization of Verbalizable Latent Reasoning.\nIn Fig.\n7\n, we compare the teacher’s textual reasoning with the student’s verbalized latent reasoning on RoboVQA. While both capture task-relevant information (\ngreen\n), the teacher generates verbose outputs with less directly relevant content (\norange\n), whereas our student produces more concise and focused responses when verbalized. This demonstrates that our preference-guided distillation not only reduces computational cost but also distills concise reasoning patterns while filtering out redundant information.\nAblation Study.\nIn Tab.\n3\n, we ablate training stages and loss components. Starting from the full Fast-ThinkAct, removing\nℒ\nverb\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{verb}}\ncauses performance drops as latent CoTs lack preference-based guidance to align with high-quality reasoning and suppress low-quality patterns. Further removing\nℒ\ndistill\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{distill}}\nleads to additional decline, indicating that aligning trajectory-level representations is crucial for transferring visual planning capabilities. Comparing training strategies, CoT-SFT underperforms SFT on EgoPlan-Bench2 and RoboVQA but improves on OpenEQA, suggesting naïve chain-of-thought supervision benefits open-ended QA but introduces verbosity that hinders structured reasoning tasks. Our preference-guided approach distills high-quality reasoning while maintaining efficiency. This validates the necessity of our proposed distillation framework and visual trajectory alignment. We provide additional ablation studies in the supplementary material.\n5\nConclusion\nWe presented\nFast-ThinkAct\n, an efficient reasoning framework for vision-language-action tasks that achieves compact yet expressive planning through verbalizable latent reasoning. By distilling lengthy textual reasoning into compact latent representations via preference-guided distillation and visual trajectory alignment, our approach bridges high-level embodied reasoning with low-level action execution through reasoning-enhanced policy learning. Extensive experiments across diverse robotic manipulation and embodied reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-ThinkAct achieves strong performance with significantly reduced inference latency while enabling effective long-horizon planning, few-shot adaptation, and failure recovery capabilities.\nLimitations and Future Works.\nAs our verbalizer\n𝒱\nψ\n\\mathcal{V}_{\\psi}\nis built upon a pre-trained LLM, it inevitably inherits language model limitations, including hallucination, occasionally producing plausible but inaccurate descriptions. However, this does not affect action execution during inference, as the verbalizer serves only for interpretability while action prediction uses the grounded latent representations from visual plan distillation. To further improve the faithfulness of verbalized reasoning, we can consider incorporating grounding-aware objectives or hallucination suppression techniques in future work.\nAppendix A\nAdditional Experimental Setup\nA.1\nAlgorithm\nInput:\nCoT-SFT checkpoint\nℱ\nθ\n0\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta_{0}}\n, training data\n𝒟\n\\mathcal{D}\n, rollout size\nN\nN\n, latent reasoning steps\nM\nM\n, number of waypoints\nK\nK\n, total iterations\nT\ntotal\nT_{\\text{total}}\nOutput:\nTrained student model\nℱ\nθ\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}\n//\nInitialize models\nℱ\nθ\nT\n←\nℱ\nθ\n0\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}^{T}\\leftarrow\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta_{0}}\n,\nℱ\nθ\n←\nℱ\nθ\n0\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}\\leftarrow\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta_{0}}\n;\nInitialize verbalizer\n𝒱\nψ\n\\mathcal{V}_{\\psi}\nfrom pre-trained LLM;\nt\n←\n0\nt\\leftarrow 0\n;\nwhile\nt\n<\nT\ntotal\nt<T_{\\text{total}}\ndo\nSample batch\n(\no\n,\nl\n,\np\n^\n)\n(o,l,\\hat{p})\nfrom\n𝒟\n\\mathcal{D}\n;\n//\nSuppose bs=1 for simplicity\n0.5em\n//\nTeacher GRPO training\nGenerate\nN\nN\nrollouts\n{\nτ\ni\n}\ni\n=\n1\nN\n\\{\\tau_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{N}\nfrom\nℱ\nθ\nT\n​\n(\no\n,\nl\n)\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}^{T}(o,l)\n;\nCompute trajectory rewards\n{\nr\ni\n}\ni\n=\n1\nN\n\\{r_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{N}\n;\nCompute group-wise advantages\n{\nA\ni\n}\ni\n=\n1\nN\n\\{A_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{N}\n;\nUpdate\nℱ\nθ\nT\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}^{T}\nwith\n𝒥\nGRPO\n\\mathcal{J}_{\\text{GRPO}}\n(Eq. 1);\nτ\n+\n←\narg\n⁡\nmax\ni\n⁡\nA\ni\n\\tau^{+}\\leftarrow\\arg\\max_{i}A_{i}\n,\nτ\n−\n←\narg\n⁡\nmin\ni\n⁡\nA\ni\n\\tau^{-}\\leftarrow\\arg\\min_{i}A_{i}\n(Eq. 3) ;\n//\nFor student distillation\nh\nt\nT\n←\nh_{t}^{T}\\leftarrow\nhidden state of\nτ\n+\n\\tau^{+}\nat\n<answer>\ntoken from\nℱ\nθ\nT\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}^{T}\n;\n//\nFor distillation loss\n//\nStudent latent distillation\n𝐳\n=\n{\nz\nm\n}\nm\n=\n1\nM\n←\nℱ\nθ\n​\n(\no\n,\nl\n)\n\\mathbf{z}=\\{z_{m}\\}_{m=1}^{M}\\leftarrow\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}(o,l)\n;\n//\nPerform auto-regressive latent reasoning\nCompute\nℒ\nverb\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{verb}}\nwith\n𝐳\n\\mathbf{z}\n,\n𝒱\nψ\n\\mathcal{V}_{\\psi}\n,\nτ\n+\n\\tau^{+}\n,\nτ\n−\n\\tau^{-}\n(Eq. 4);\nForward\nK\nK\nspatial tokens from\nℱ\nθ\n​\n(\no\n,\nl\n,\n𝐳\n)\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}(o,l,\\mathbf{z})\nto obtain\nh\nt\nh_{t}\nand\n{\nh\n′\n​\n(\n𝐬\ni\n)\n}\ni\n=\n1\nK\n\\{h^{\\prime}(\\mathbf{s}_{i})\\}_{i=1}^{K}\n;\nCompute\nℒ\ndistill\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{distill}}\nwith\nh\nt\nT\nh_{t}^{T}\n,\nh\nt\nh_{t}\n(Eq. 5);\nCompute\nℒ\nans\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{ans}}\nwith\n{\nh\n′\n​\n(\n𝐬\ni\n)\n}\ni\n=\n1\nK\n\\{h^{\\prime}(\\mathbf{s}_{i})\\}_{i=1}^{K}\n,\np\n^\n\\hat{p}\n(Eq. 6);\nUpdate\nℱ\nθ\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}\nwith\nℒ\nstudent\n=\nℒ\nverb\n+\nℒ\ndistill\n+\nℒ\nans\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{student}}=\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{verb}}+\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{distill}}+\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{ans}}\n;\nt\n←\nt\n+\n1\nt\\leftarrow t+1\n;\nend while\nreturn\nℱ\nθ\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}\n;\nAlgorithm 1\nTraining Fast-ThinkAct (Sec. 3.2)\nAlgorithm\n1\npresents the complete training procedure corresponding to Sec. 3.2. It shows how we jointly optimize the teacher model with GRPO and distill its reasoning into the student’s compact latent representations.\nA.2\nImplementation Details\nOur implementation follows the setup described in Sec. 4.1 of the main paper. Here we provide additional details. The verbalizer\n𝒱\nψ\n\\mathcal{V}_{\\psi}\nis initialized from a small LLM, Qwen3-0.6B, with cross-attention layers inserted at each layer to condition on latent CoTs\n𝐳\n\\mathbf{z}\n. For the student model training, in the first 3,000 iterations, we replace verbalization loss\nℒ\nverb\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{verb}}\nwith language modeling loss using\nτ\n+\n\\tau^{+}\nas ground truth to warm up\n𝒱\nψ\n\\mathcal{V}_{\\psi}\n’s alignment with the latent representations\n𝐳\n\\mathbf{z}\n. We then freeze\n𝒱\nψ\n\\mathcal{V}_{\\psi}\nand use the\nℒ\nverb\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{verb}}\nfor the remaining 1,500 iterations. The student\nℱ\nθ\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}\nis optimized throughout both phases. For waypoint prediction in Eq. 6, each\np\ni\n∈\nℝ\n6\np_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{6}\nencodes coordinates in the format\n[\nx\nsingle\n,\ny\nsingle\n,\nx\nleft\n,\ny\nleft\n,\nx\nright\n,\ny\nright\n]\n[x_{\\text{single}},y_{\\text{single}},x_{\\text{left}},y_{\\text{left}},x_{\\text{right}},y_{\\text{right}}]\n, where the first two dimensions are for single-arm and the last four are for bimanual robot. For ground-truth\np\n^\n​\ni\n\\hat{p}i\n, we fill the corresponding dimensions based on robot type and mask out the unused dimensions when computing\nℒ\nans\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{ans}}\n. For GRPO training, we follow the configuration of ThinkAct\nhuang2025thinkact\n, using rollout size\nN\n=\n5\nN=5\n. Following\nlee2025molmoact\n, we set the number of waypoints in trajectory to\nK\n=\n5\nK=5\n. We use\nM\n=\n6\nM=6\nlatent reasoning tokens, with ablation study provided in Fig.\n8\n.\nDuring reasoning-enhanced policy learning, for SimplerEnv\nli24simpler\nevaluation, to ensure fair comparison with previous works\nkim24openvla\n;\nlee2025molmoact\n, we initialize\nπ\nϕ\n\\pi_{\\phi}\nfrom DiT-Policy\nchi2023diffusion\npre-trained on the same OXE dataset\no2024open\n;\nkim24openvla\nand conduct reasoning-enhanced policy learning (Sec. 3.3) using the same OXE data. For LIBERO\nliu2023libero\nand RoboTwin2.0\nchen2025robotwin2\nevaluations, we initialize\nπ\nϕ\n\\pi_{\\phi}\nfrom RDT\nliu2024rdt\n, which has demonstrated strong performance on RoboTwin2.0, and conduct policy learning using OXE\no2024open\nand static ALOHA datasets\nshi2023waypoint\n;\nzhao2023learning\n. Our method further enhances RDT’s manipulation capabilities on both benchmarks. The use of different action models also demonstrates that our approach is agnostic to the underlying action model choice.\nA.3\nTraining Data Details\nA.3.1\nDataset Sources\n2D Visual Trace of Manipulation Tasks.\nFor single-arm manipulation, we utilize 2D visual trajectories labeled by MolmoAct\nlee2025molmoact\nfrom the Open X-Embodiment (OXE) dataset\no2024open\n, comprising approximately 1.3M trajectories. For bimanual manipulation, we extract dual-arm visual trajectories from the AIST dataset\naist2025aist\n, resulting in approximately 92K trajectory samples. Specifically, we first use Molmo-72B\ndeitke2024molmo\nto detect left and right gripper positions (following\nlee2025molmoact\n) in the first frame, then apply CoTracker3\nkaraev2025cotracker3\nto track and parse the manipulation trajectories throughout the video sequences.\nRoboFAC\nlu2025robofac\n.\nRoboFAC is a robotic failure analysis dataset containing 9,440 erroneous manipulation trajectories across 16 tasks in both simulated and real-world environments. We utilize the training set with 64K QA pairs covering various failure types for developing failure identification and correction planning capabilities.\nRoboVQA\nsermanet2024robovqa\n.\nRoboVQA contains robot manipulation videos with QA tasks covering task understanding. The dataset includes approximately 5K long-horizon and 92K medium-horizon video sequences from diverse robotic platforms, resulting in total 798K QA pairs. Videos are annotated with multiple questions probing spatial reasoning, action prediction, and task comprehension.\nShareRobot\nji2025robobrain\n.\nShareRobot is a large-scale dataset collected by RoboBrain\nji2025robobrain\n, containing over 1M QA pairs covering task planning, object affordances, and manipulation strategies across diverse robot embodiments and scenes. The dataset features fine-grained annotations linking task descriptions to frame-level execution details, facilitating learning of transferable manipulation knowledge.\nEgoPlan-Bench\nchen2023egoplan\n.\nEgoPlan-Bench features egocentric videos of daily activities annotated with task planning information including goals, execution history, and current states. The dataset contains approximately 53K video-text pairs for training long-horizon planning and progress tracking capabilities from egocentric view.\nVideo-R1-CoT\nfeng2025video\n.\nVideo-R1 comprises 165K video question-answer pairs with chain-of-thought reasoning annotations generated by large-scale vision-language models. The dataset covers diverse reasoning domains including mathematical logic, spatial understanding, OCR, and visual analytics. All samples are quality-filtered to ensure annotation consistency and correctness.\nPixMo\ndeitke2024molmo\n.\nPixMo is a general-purpose vision-language dataset with diverse image captions and question-answer pairs. Following MolmoAct\nlee2025molmoact\n, we incorporate PixMo dataset to preserve general visual understanding and prevent catastrophic forgetting when training on embodied dataset. Specifically, we use approximately 726K samples from the\nask_model_anything\n,\ncap\n, and\ncap-qa\nsplits.\nA.3.2\nData Processing and Formatting\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT).\nTo enhance foundational embodied knowledge, we perform supervised fine-tuning on approximately 4M samples combining 2D visual trajectories from MolmoAct\nlee2025molmoact\nand AIST\naist2025aist\n, along with QA data from PixMo\ndeitke2024molmo\n, RoboFAC\nlu2025robofac\n, RoboVQA\nsermanet2024robovqa\n, ShareRobot\nji2025robobrain\n, and EgoPlan\nchen2023egoplan\n. This stage enables the model to acquire basic visual understanding, task comprehension, and manipulation knowledge across diverse embodiments and scenarios.\nChain-of-Thought SFT (CoT-SFT).\nTo develop reasoning capabilities while preserving embodied understanding, we sample 5% from the SFT data (approximately 200K samples) and augment with 165K samples from Video-R1-CoT\nfeng2025video\n. For data with CoT annotations, we format prompts to elicit structured reasoning enclosed in\n<think>\ntags followed by answers in\n<answer>\ntags; for data without CoT annotations, we prompt for direct answers only. This enables the model to learn reasoning capabilities from CoT-annotated data and generalize them to embodied tasks.\nTeacher-Student Training.\nBuilding upon the CoT-SFT checkpoint, we curate a balanced training set by sampling approximately 5,000 instances from each dataset and data type, totaling nearly 50K samples. We adopt the prompt formatting strategy from CoT-SFT for both teacher GRPO training and student latent distillation. We train both the teacher with GRPO and the student with latent distillation (as detailed in Sec. 3.2) on this data, efficiently transferring high-quality reasoning patterns into compact latent representations.\nTable 4\n:\nQuantitative results with larger model size (7B or 8B) on embodied reasoning benchmarks.\nMethod\nEgoPlan-Bench2\nRoboVQA\nOpenEQA\nOverall\nDaily.\nWork.\nRec.\nHobbies\nAvg.\nB-1\nB-2\nB-3\nB-4\nB-Avg.\nScore\nAvg.\nInternVL2.5-8B\nchen2024expanding\n36.2\n28.7\n34.4\n35.4\n33.5\n40.5\n33.3\n29.6\n27.5\n32.7\n54.4\n40.2\nInternVL3-8B\nzhu2025internvl3\n38.5\n32.9\n36.1\n37.2\n36.2\n44.3\n36.5\n31.6\n28.9\n35.3\n55.5\n42.3\nNVILA-8B\nliu2024nvila\n35.8\n28.7\n37.2\n35.4\n33.7\n42.7\n39.7\n37.6\n36.1\n39.0\n54.0\n42.2\nQwen2.5-VL-7B\nbai2025qwen2\n31.4\n26.7\n29.5\n28.6\n29.1\n47.8\n41.2\n36.2\n33.7\n39.7\n50.8\n39.9\nMagma-8B\nyang2025magma\n32.1\n25.7\n34.4\n29.3\n29.8\n38.6\n31.5\n28.1\n26.7\n31.2\n49.1\n36.7\nRoboBrain2.0-7B\nteam2025robobrain2\n39.4\n27.0\n33.9\n32.2\n33.2\n44.9\n38.2\n34.7\n33.5\n37.8\n51.1\n40.7\nThinkAct-7B\nhuang2025thinkact\n50.1\n49.8\n44.8\n45.2\n48.2\n69.1\n61.8\n56.0\n52.4\n59.8\n56.2\n54.7\nFast-ThinkAct-7B\n51.3\n47.3\n41.5\n45.9\n47.5\n70.4\n63.3\n57.3\n53.2\n61.1\n59.0\n55.9\nTable 5\n:\nResults on LIBERO and SimplerEnv benchmarks with additional ThinkAct-3B comparison.\nMethod\nLIBERO\nSimplerEnv-Google\nLatency (\n↓\n\\downarrow\n)\nOpenVLA-7B\nkim24openvla\n76.5\n40.2\nN/A\nCoT-VLA-7B\nzhao2025cot\n83.9\nN/A\nN/A\nThinkAct-7B\nhuang2025thinkact\n84.4\n68.3\n7513\nMolmoAct-7B\nlee2025molmoact\n86.8\n64.9\n6723\nThinkAct-3B\nhuang2025thinkact\n83.1\n64.7\n5674\nFast-ThinkAct-3B\n89.7\n68.7\n805 (\n↓\n\\downarrow\n7.0\n×\n\\times\n)\nTable 6\n:\nComparison with efficient textual reasoning methods.\nMethod\nEgoPlan-\nBench2\nRoboVQA\nOpenEQA\nAverage\nTextual Teacher\nℱ\nθ\nT\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}^{T}\n41.7\n58.2\n49.4\n49.8\nℱ\nθ\nT\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}^{T}\nInference w/o thinking\n42.7\n55.0\n41.7\n46.5\nℱ\nθ\nT\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}^{T}\nInference w/ 6 textual tokens\n39.3\n53.0\n46.5\n46.3\nℱ\nθ\nT\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}^{T}\nw/ RL Length-Penalty\narora2025training\n41.2\n57.5\n44.7\n47.8\nFast-ThinkAct-3B\n46.4\n60.8\n52.8\n53.3\nA.4\nEvaluation Setup\nA.4.1\nEmbodied Reasoning Benchmarks\nWe evaluate on three benchmarks assessing different aspects of embodied reasoning. EgoPlan-Bench2\nchen2023egoplan\ntests egocentric task planning across 24 daily-life scenarios with 1,321 multiple-choice questions, measuring accuracy in predicting next steps given task goals and progress history. RoboVQA\nsermanet2024robovqa\nevaluates visual reasoning in manipulation contexts through 1,893 free-form QA pairs from robot and human demonstrations, assessed via BLEU score. OpenEQA\nmajumdar2024openeqa\nassesses spatial and functional understanding through 1,600+ questions spanning 180+ real-world environments, evaluated using LLM-based scoring aligned with human preferences. These benchmarks comprehensively evaluate embodied reasoning capability across planning, manipulation, and spatial understanding.\nA.4.2\nRobotic Manipulation Benchmarks\nFigure 8\n:\nVisualization of predicted visual trajectories and action execution results on RoboTwin2.0.\nYellow traces indicate left gripper trajectories; red traces indicate right gripper trajectories for bimanual tasks.\nFigure 9\n:\nFailure identification and analysis capabilities on RoboFAC\nlu2025robofac\n.\nTop row shows identification of failure types and execution stages.

SimplerEnv\nli24simpler\nprovides manipulation tasks with strong sim-to-real correlation, featuring diverse visual variations in lighting, textures, backgrounds, and camera poses. Following MolmoAct\nlee2025molmoact\n, we evaluate on the Google Robot tasks using the standard protocol\nkim24openvla\n;\nlee2025molmoact\nof directly evaluating on SimplerEnv after training on OXE. LIBERO\nliu2023libero\ntargets different generalization challenges through four task suites: spatial layout variation (LIBERO-Spatial), object diversity (LIBERO-Object), goal variation (LIBERO-Goal), and long-horizon planning with mixed variations (LIBERO-Long). We evaluate each suite over 500 trials using 3 random seeds following prior works\nkim24openvla\n;\nlee2025molmoact\n. RoboTwin2.0\nchen2025robotwin2\nfeatures challenging bimanual manipulation with easy and hard difficulty settings, where the hard setting introduces domain randomization including clutter, lighting variations, diverse textures, and height changes. Following the original protocol, we train on 50 clean expert demonstrations per task and evaluate with 100 rollouts under both settings. We assess 10 tasks categorized into short, medium, and long horizons based on demonstration lengths.\nAppendix B\nAdditional Experiment Results\nB.1\nAdditional Quantitative Results\nResults of Larger Model Size.\nTo demonstrate the scalability of our approach, we apply Fast-ThinkAct to a larger backbone, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, and evaluate its performance on embodied reasoning benchmarks. As shown in Tab.\n4\n, Fast-ThinkAct consistently achieves strong performance across EgoPlan-Bench2\nqiu2024egoplan2\n, RoboVQA\nsermanet2024robovqa\n, and OpenEQA\nmajumdar2024openeqa\n, validating that our latent reasoning distillation method effectively scales to larger model backbones.\nPerformance Comparison with ThinkAct-3B.\nTab.\n5\npresents detailed numerical results corresponding to Fig. 3 with additional ThinkAct-3B results. At the same 3B model size, Fast-ThinkAct achieves notable performance gains (89.7 vs. 83.1 on LIBERO, 68.7 vs. 64.7 on SimplerEnv-Google) while dramatically improving efficiency with\n7\n×\n\\times\nfaster inference (805ms vs. 5674ms).\nComparison with Efficient Reasoning Baselines.\nTable\n6\ncompares our method with efficient textual reasoning alternatives applied to the textual teacher\nℱ\nθ\nT\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}^{T}\n. We evaluate three baselines: removing reasoning during inference entirely (0 tokens), constraining the teacher to generate only 6 textual tokens during inference, and applying RL training with a length penalty\narora2025training\nto encourage concise reasoning (\n∼\n\\sim\n50 tokens). These achieve 46.5, 46.3, and 47.8 respectively, all degrading from the teacher’s 49.8. In contrast, Fast-ThinkAct uses only 6 latent tokens and achieves\n53.3\n, demonstrating superior efficiency and performance.\nB.2\nAdditional Qualitative Results\nQualitative Robot Execution.\nWe provide qualitative robot execution comparisons between the base action model RDT\nliu2024rdt\nand Fast-ThinkAct in the supplementary video\nFast-ThinkAct.mp4\n. Our method shows substantial improvements on challenging robotic execution tasks, where reasoning capabilities provide better spatial understanding and coordination for successful manipulation.\nBimanual Manipulation Results.\nIn Fig.\n8\n, we present visualized trajectories and execution results for\nhanging mug\nand\nhandover mic\ntasks under easy and hard settings in RoboTwin2.0\nchen2025robotwin2\n. The hard setting includes different backgrounds and distractor objects. These examples show successful bimanual coordination where predicted waypoints accurately guide both grippers through the manipulation sequence, demonstrating Fast-ThinkAct’s spatial reasoning ability across varied visual conditions.\nFailure Identification and Recovery.\nIn Fig.\n9\n, we demonstrate Fast-ThinkAct’s failure identification and analysis capabilities, complementing the recovery planning shown in the main paper. The top row shows that Fast-ThinkAct identifies failure types (e.g., position deviation) and execution stages (e.g., reaching for the cube). The bottom row illustrates root cause analysis, for instance, in the bottom-right example, the model correctly infers that the failure to push the cube with an L-shaped tool stems from an improper initial grasp. These results demonstrate Fast-ThinkAct’s comprehensive understanding of manipulation failures beyond recovery planning.\nVerbalized Latent Reasoning.\nFig.\n10\nvisualizes teacher textual reasoning and student verbalized reasoning. While the student generates compact and correct (\ngreen\n) reasoning, the teacher’s lengthy output sometimes contains erroneous steps (\nred\n) that might degrade the performance.\nB.3\nAdditional Ablation Study and Analysis\nAdditional Ablation Results on Manipulation Benchmarks.\nTable\n8\nshows ablation results on LIBERO\nliu2023libero\n, SimplerEnv-Google\nli24simpler\n, and RoboTwin2.0\nchen2025robotwin2\n. Removing\nℒ\nverb\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{verb}}\nor\nℒ\ndistill\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{distill}}\nprogressively degrades performance, confirming their contributions. Our full model consistently outperforms the textual teacher and models without teacher-student training (CoT-SFT, SFT only), demonstrating the benefits of compact latent reasoning distillation.\nTable 7\n:\nAdditional ablation study of training objectives and learning stages on robot manipulation benchmarks.\nMethod\nLIBERO\nSimplerEnv\nGoogle\nRoboTwin2.0\nAverage\nFast-ThinkAct\n89.7\n68.7\n46.1\n68.2\nw/o\nℒ\nverb\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{verb}}\n88.6\n67.3\n44.9\n66.9\nw/o\nℒ\nverb\n,\nℒ\ndistill\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{verb}},\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{distill}}\n86.3\n65.7\n42.6\n64.9\nTextual Teacher\n88.5\n67.3\n45.8\n67.2\nSFT + CoT-SFT\n87.2\n65.8\n43.3\n65.4\nSFT only\n86.9\n64.5\n42.8\n64.7\nTable 8\n:\nAblation of Latent Reasoning Steps\nM\nM\n.\nAblation Study on Action Model Conditioning.\nIn Sec. 3.3, we extract visual latent planning\nc\nt\nc_{t}\nfrom early-layer KV cache of spatial tokens to condition the action model.

Our approach achieves\n89.7\non LIBERO, outperforming late-layer KV at 88.3 and output hidden states at 87.1, demonstrating that early-layer representations better capture visual planning information for action prediction. Therefore, we adopt early-layer KV conditioning as our default configuration.\nAblation Study on Latent Reasoning Steps.\nIn Fig.\n8\n, we study the effect of latent reasoning steps\nM\nM\n. We observe that too few steps (\nM\n=\n1\nM=1\n) limit reasoning capacity, while excessive steps (\nM\n=\n30\n,\n100\nM=30,100\n) might introduce redundant or noisy information. Therefore, we adopt\nM\n=\n6\nM=6\n, which achieves optimal performance, as our default.\nReferences",

            "answer": "## 论文分析：Fast-ThinkAct 及其技术脉络梳理\n\n基于论文内容，Fast-ThinkAct 是 Vision-Language-Action (VLA) 推理模型发展脉络中的一个最新工作。其核心贡献在于**通过可言语化的潜在规划，在保持高性能的同时，大幅降低了推理延迟**。以下将梳理该方向的发展脉络，重点分析每一步的改进以及几个不同的发展方向。\n\n### 发展脉络总览\n\n该领域的发展可以概括为三个阶段：\n1.  **基础 VLA 模型**：通过模仿学习从大规模机器人演示数据中学习技能，但泛化能力有限。\n2.  **显式推理 VLA**：引入链式思维等显式推理机制，提升泛化与规划能力，但带来高昂的推理延迟。\n3.  **高效推理 VLA**：旨在压缩或优化推理过程，在保持性能的同时实现实时或近实时决策。**Fast-ThinkAct 属于此阶段的最新工作**。\n\n---\n\n### 第一阶段：基础 VLA 模型 (模仿学习)\n\n*   **代表工作**：RT-1/2, Octo, OpenVLA, π₀, Magma 等。\n*   **核心思想**：将视觉-语言模型 (VLM) 在大规模机器人动作数据集上进行端到端的监督微调，学习语言条件化的策略。\n*   **改进与价值**：\n    *   **证明了数据驱动的可行性**：展示了利用互联网规模的机器人数据训练通用策略的潜力。\n    *   **实现了基础技能**：在训练分布内的拾取、放置等任务上表现良好。\n*   **局限性**：\n    *   **泛化能力差**：严重受限于训练数据分布，难以应对长视野规划、新场景适应、从失败中恢复等任务。\n    *   **缺乏显式推理**：模型是“黑箱”，决策过程不透明，难以进行复杂的问题分解和逻辑规划。\n\n### 第二阶段：显式推理 VLA (提升泛化)\n\n为了克服基础 VLA 的局限性，研究者们引入了**显式的中间推理过程**。这个方向又可分为几个子方向：\n\n#### 发展方向 1: 基于监督的链式思维 (Supervised CoT)\n*   **代表工作**：Embodied CoT, CoT-VLA, MolmoAct, EO-1。\n*   **核心思想**：利用标注的或由大模型生成的中间推理步骤（文本或视觉形式）作为监督信号，训练模型先“思考”再“行动”。\n*   **技术改进**：\n    *   **文本推理**：使用现成的 LLM/VLM 生成伪 CoT 标签，引导模型进行语言推理。\n    *   **视觉推理**：生成结构化的视觉表示（如子目标图像、深度图、2D 视觉轨迹）作为中间规划，更好地连接空间理解与动作。\n    *   **价值**：显著提升了模型在长视野任务、少样本适应和组合泛化上的能力，使决策过程更可解释。\n*   **局限性**：\n    *   **依赖标注**：需要大量高质量的推理标注，数据获取成本高。\n    *   **覆盖有限**：性能受限于监督数据的覆盖范围。\n    *   **推理延迟高**：生成冗长的文本或视觉推理链（~250个token）导致推理速度慢（秒级），无法满足实时机器人控制的需求。\n\n#### 发展方向 2: 基于强化学习的推理 (RL-based Reasoning)\n*   **代表工作**：**ThinkAct** (Fast-ThinkAct 的前作)。\n*   **核心思想**：不依赖人工标注，而是使用强化学习 (RL)，通过设计**与动作对齐的视觉奖励**来引导模型生成有益的链式思维。\n*   **技术改进**：\n    *   **免于标注**：利用 RL（如 GRPO）自动探索和优化推理路径，摆脱了对大量标注数据的依赖。\n    *   **奖励驱动**：推理质量直接由任务完成度、轨迹对齐等下游指标衡量和优化，确保了推理对最终动作的有效性。\n*   **局限性**：\n    *   **延迟问题加剧**：RL 训练倾向于生成更长、更详细的推理链以最大化奖励，使得推理延迟问题比监督方法更突出。\n    *   **训练不稳定**：RL 训练本身具有挑战性，可能不稳定。\n\n### 第三阶段：高效推理 VLA (压缩与加速)\n\n针对显式推理 VLA 的高延迟瓶颈，近期工作开始探索如何**压缩推理过程**。Fast-ThinkAct 在此背景下提出，并针对几个不同的高效化方向做出了创新。\n\n#### 发展方向 1: 推理长度惩罚/丢弃\n*   **代表工作**：ECoT-Lite, 以及一些 LLM 中的 RL 长度惩罚方法。\n*   **核心思想**：在训练或推理时，强制或鼓励模型生成更短的推理链。例如，ECoT-Lite 在测试时随机“丢弃”部分推理步骤。\n*   **技术改进**：直接减少了需要生成的 token 数量，从而降低延迟。\n*   **局限性**：\n    *   **性能下降风险**：简单缩短或丢弃可能损失关键推理信息，导致规划不一致或性能下降。\n    *   **非本质压缩**：未改变推理的表示形式，效率提升有限。\n\n#### 发展方向 2: 潜在空间推理 (Latent Reasoning) - **Fast-ThinkAct 的核心贡献**\n*   **代表工作**：**Fast-ThinkAct**，以及 LLM 领域的 Coconut, CODI 等。\n*   **核心思想**：**将冗长的离散文本推理，蒸馏/压缩成紧凑的连续潜在向量**。模型在潜在空间进行“思考”，这些潜在向量蕴含了规划信息，并能被一个“言语化器”解码回文本以供解释。\n*   **技术改进 (Fast-ThinkAct 的贡献)**：\n    1.  **可言语化的潜在规划**：提出“学生-教师”蒸馏框架。教师模型（如 ThinkAct）生成显式文本 CoT，学生模型学习生成极少数（如6个）连续潜在 token。通过一个可训练的言语化器 LLM 和基于偏好的损失函数，确保这些潜在 token 能够对应到高质量的推理模式。\n    2.  **视觉规划对齐**：除了语言推理，还通过对齐教师和学生模型的轨迹级隐藏状态，将**视觉规划能力**蒸馏到潜在表示中，这对于具身控制至关重要。\n    3.  **并行空间轨迹预测**：引入可学习的空间 token，并行预测未来路径点，替代了教师模型自回归生成文本路径点的低效方式。\n    4.  **推理增强的策略学习**：将训练好的学生 VLM 生成的潜在视觉规划，通过 KV 缓存注入到动作模型中，桥接了高层规划与底层动作执行。\n*   **价值与改进**：\n    *   **极致效率**：实现了 **~89.3% 的推理延迟降低**，比其前作 ThinkAct-7B 快 9.3 倍。\n    *   **保持甚至提升性能**：在多个机器人操作和具身推理基准上达到 SOTA，证明了紧凑潜在表示的有效性。\n    *   **保留关键能力**：成功保持了长视野规划、少样本适应和失败恢复等由推理带来的核心优势。\n*   **局限性**：\n    *   **言语化器可能幻觉**：用于解释潜在向量的言语化器可能产生不准确的描述，但这不影响动作执行。\n    *   **框架复杂性**：涉及多阶段训练（教师 RL 训练、学生蒸馏、策略学习），流程相对复杂。\n\n---\n\n### 总结：不同发展方向的对比\n\n| 发展方向 | 核心思路 | 优点 | 缺点 | 代表工作 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **监督 CoT** | 学习标注的推理步骤 | 提升泛化，过程可解释 | 依赖标注，延迟高 | CoT-VLA, MolmoAct |\n| **RL CoT** | 用奖励优化推理生成 | 免标注，推理与任务强相关 | 延迟极高，训练不稳定 | **ThinkAct** (前作) |\n| **长度控制** | 强制生成更短推理 | 简单，直接提速 | 易损失信息，性能下降 | ECoT-Lite |\n| **潜在推理** | 将推理压缩为连续向量 | **高效与性能兼得**，保留规划能力 | 框架复杂，解释依赖额外模型 | **Fast-ThinkAct** |\n\n**结论**：Fast-ThinkAct 站在其前作 ThinkAct（RL CoT）的肩膀上，敏锐地抓住了“推理延迟”这一制约具身 AI 实际应用的瓶颈。它没有选择简单的“缩短文本”路径，而是开创性地转向“**潜在空间推理**”，通过精心设计的偏好蒸馏和视觉对齐机制，成功地将丰富的语言和视觉规划信息压缩到极少的潜在 token 中。这项工作标志着 VLA 推理模型从“追求能力”到“**兼顾能力与效率**”的重要转变，为实时、高效的具身智能系统提供了可行的技术方案。未来的工作可能会进一步探索更简单的单阶段训练、更鲁棒的潜在表示学习，以及如何彻底消除对独立言语化器的依赖。",

            "question": "论文的主要局限性有哪些？未来可能的改进方向是什么？",
            "answer": "## 论文主要局限性分析\n\n根据论文内容，Fast-ThinkAct 的主要局限性集中在**可解释性组件（Verbalizer）的可靠性**上：\n\n- **语言模型的固有问题**：论文明确指出，用于将潜在推理解码为可读文本的 `Verbalizer` 是基于预训练的大型语言模型（LLM）构建的。因此，它**不可避免地继承了LLM的常见缺陷**，例如**幻觉**——即生成看似合理但实际不准确或与潜在表示不符的描述。\n- **对核心功能无影响**：值得强调的是，这一局限性**并不影响模型在推理时的动作执行性能**。因为 `Verbalizer` 仅在训练阶段用于指导潜在表示的学习，以及在需要时可提供解释性输出。动作预测完全依赖于经过视觉规划蒸馏得到的、更可靠的**潜在表示**，`Verbalizer` 并非推理流水线的必需部分。\n\n## 未来可能的改进方向\n\n论文针对上述局限性，提出了明确的未来工作方向，并隐含了其他潜在优化点：\n\n1. **提升 Verbalizer 的忠实度**：\n   - **引入 grounding-aware 目标**：在训练 `Verbalizer` 时，可以增加使其输出与视觉观察或动作轨迹更紧密对齐的约束或损失函数。\n   - **采用幻觉抑制技术**：借鉴大语言模型领域的研究，应用专门的技术来减少或检测 `Verbalizer` 输出中的不实信息。\n\n2. **隐含的扩展与优化方向**（基于方法设计）：\n   - **模型架构与效率的进一步探索**：当前方法将推理压缩为6个潜在token，未来可以研究**自适应长度的潜在推理**，或探索更高效的编码架构，在保持性能的同时进一步降低延迟。\n   - **训练策略的增强**：论文使用了偏好蒸馏（DPO风格）和轨迹对齐。未来可以探索**更复杂的奖励设计**或**多任务联合优化**，以更好地平衡推理质量、压缩率和动作性能。\n   - **更广泛的任务与场景验证**：当前工作在多个仿真基准上进行了验证。未来的重要方向是在**真实机器人平台**和**更复杂、动态的真实世界场景**中测试其效率与鲁棒性，这对实际部署至关重要。\n   - **消除对教师模型的依赖**：当前方法依赖于一个经过强化学习训练的教师模型来提供高质量的推理轨迹。未来可以研究**端到端的训练框架**或**自监督方法**，以减少对昂贵教师模型训练的依赖。\n\n**总结**：Fast-ThinkAct 的核心创新——将冗长推理压缩为高效的潜在表示——本身是稳健的。其主要局限在于外围的解释性组件，而这可以通过现有的大语言模型对齐技术进行改进。未来的工作将围绕提升整个系统的忠实度、效率及在更复杂现实场景中的适用性展开。",
