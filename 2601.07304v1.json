Traditional end-to-end learning approaches often struggle to handle the conflicting demands of these distinct phases. Navigation relies on robust decision-making over large spaces, while manipulation needs high sensitivity to fine local details. Forcing a single network to learn these different objectives simultaneously often causes optimization interference, where improving one task degrades the other. To address these limitations, we propose a Heterogeneous Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (HMER) framework tailored for autonomous forklifts. HMER decomposes long-horizon tasks into specialized sub-policies controlled by a Semantic Task Planner. This structure separates macro-level navigation from micro-level manipulation, allowing each expert to focus on its specific action space without interference. The planner coordinates the sequential execution of these experts, bridging the gap between task planning and continuous control. Furthermore, to solve the problem of sparse exploration, we introduce a Hybrid Imitation-Reinforcement Training Strategy. This method uses expert demonstrations to initialize the policy and Reinforcement Learning for fine-tuning. Experiments in Gazebo simulations show that HMER significantly outperforms sequential and end-to-end baselines. Our method achieves a task success rate of 94.2% (compared to 62.5% for baselines), reduces operation time by 21.4%, and maintains placement error within 1.5 cm, validating its efficacy for precise material handling.\nI\nIntroduction\nIn the rapidly evolving landscape of smart logistics, the demand for autonomous mobile manipulation—particularly involving heavy-duty machinery like forklifts—is increasing rapidly. Unlike Automatic Guided Vehicles (AGVs) that adhere to rigid, pre-defined paths, autonomous forklifts in modern warehouses must operate in unstructured environments and execute complex long-horizon tasks. These missions typically involve a continuous cycle: navigating through dynamic obstacles, visually searching for cargo, picking it up, and stacking it with centimeter-level precision. This dual requirement poses a significant robotic control challenge: the system must simultaneously master large-scale spatial navigation and fine-grained object interaction, integrating sequential decision-making with complex vehicle dynamics.\nHowever, developing a robust control policy for such tasks remains an open problem due to three fundamental limitations in existing paradigms. First, traditional End-to-End Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods often succumb to optimization interference. Compelling a single network to simultaneously encode geometric navigation features and semantic manipulation cues results in gradient conflict, where the optimization of large-scale mobility dominates the learning of fine-grained interaction. Second, while sequential modular approaches mitigate this complexity by executing sub-tasks in series, they suffer from error propagation and irreversibility. Since these frameworks typically execute navigation and manipulation phases in isolation, minor state deviations accumulated during transit inevitably cascade into the manipulation phase. Lacking a high-level mechanism to dynamically revert states or re-plan, these systems cannot recover from such propagated errors, leading to task failure in unstructured environments. Third, although Imitation Learning (IL) offers a stable policy initialization, it is fundamentally restricted by the performance ceiling of the demonstrator. Pure supervised learning is confined to the distribution of the training data and precludes the discovery of superior control strategies through environmental interaction, thereby failing to achieve the sub-centimeter precision mandated by industrial operations.\nTo address these limitations, we propose a Heterogeneous Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (HMER) framework tailored for autonomous forklifts. Our core insight is to structurally decouple the complex long-horizon task into a hierarchy of specialized experts, thereby resolving the optimization interference problem. Specifically, we design a Navigation Expert that focuses on macro-level geometric robustness for path planning, and Manipulation Experts that focus on micro-level semantic details for precise interaction. These specialized skills are orchestrated by a high-level Semantic Task Planner, which acts as a closed-loop decision maker to bridge discrete task logic with continuous motor control.\nFurthermore, to solve the trade-off between exploration efficiency and control precision, we introduce a unified Hybrid Imitation-Reinforcement Training Strategy. Training long-horizon tasks from scratch is computationally inefficient due to sparse rewards. We first utilize expert demonstrations to warm-start all expert policies via Behavioral Cloning (BC), establishing a baseline competency. Subsequently, we employ Reinforcement Learning (RL) to fine-tune these policies end-to-end. This refinement phase is critical: it enables the manipulation agents to learn subtle, non-intuitive control maneuvers that surpass the heuristic expert, achieving the high precision required for real-world deployment.\nThe main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n1. A Heterogeneous Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning Framework (HMER): Distinct from traditional end-to-end learning paradigms, we propose a hierarchical framework that fundamentally addresses the optimization interference problem in autonomous mobile manipulation. By explicitly decoupling macro-level navigation from micro-level manipulation, our approach allows each expert to specialize in its specific action space without conflicting gradients, ensuring robust performance.\n2. Hierarchical Semantic Task Planning: We design a high-level Semantic Task Planner to orchestrate the sequential execution of heterogeneous experts. Unlike rigid sequential methods, this state-aware mechanism enables the autonomous forklift to adaptively switch between navigation and stacking phases and autonomously recover from propagated errors via closed-loop decision making.\n3. Unified Hybrid Imitation-Reinforcement Training Strategy: To overcome the exploration sparsity of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and the precision bottlenecks of Imitation Learning (IL), we introduce a hybrid training paradigm. This strategy leverages expert demonstrations to warm-start policy networks and subsequently employs RL for residual refinement. This enables the system to achieve 1.5 cm placement precision, significantly surpassing the capabilities of heuristic baselines and meeting strict industrial safety standards.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II reviews related work in autonomous mobile manipulation and hierarchical reinforcement learning. Section III formally formulates the long-horizon multi-goal task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Section IV details the proposed HMER framework, elaborating on the Semantic Task Planner and the decoupled expert policies, followed by the hybrid training strategy. Section V describes the high-fidelity simulation environment and implementation details. Section VI presents extensive experimental results, comparative analyses against baselines, and ablation studies. Finally, Section VII concludes the paper and outlines future directions.\nII\nRelated work\nResearch on autonomous mobile manipulation has evolved significantly in recent years, broadly branching into three primary paradigms: classical planning, data-driven monolithic learning, and hierarchical approaches. In this section, we review the literature in these domains and position our work within the context of unstructured warehouse logistics.\nII-A\nTask and Motion Planning (TAMP)\nEarly attempts to solve mobile manipulation predominantly relied on classical Task and Motion Planning (TAMP). These approaches view navigation and manipulation as distinct geometric problems. TAMP methods\n[\n8\n,\n4\n]\nintegrate these by searching for a logically consistent sequence of symbolic actions coupled with continuous motion trajectories. To handle complex kinematic constraints, researchers have developed extensible interface layers\n[\n16\n]\nand optimization-based logic-geometric programming\n[\n19\n]\nto bridge symbolic planners with continuous solvers.\nWhile theoretically sound in structured settings, TAMP methods suffer from a critical limitation: reliance on\n“privileged information.”\nThey typically assume access to pre-built high-definition maps\n[\n18\n]\nor precise 3D object models\n[\n15\n]\nfor collision checking. In the context of autonomous forklifts, this rigidity is problematic as warehouse layouts change dynamically with moving inventory. Unlike TAMP frameworks that require exact belief space estimation\n[\n9\n]\n, our approach relies purely on onboard sensors (LiDAR and RGB), allowing the agent to adapt to unstructured environments without perfect state estimation.\nII-B\nEnd-to-End and Imitation Learning\nTo overcome the dependency on manual modeling, researchers have turned to data-driven approaches. End-to-End Reinforcement Learning (RL) attempts to map raw sensor observations directly to control actions\n[\n11\n]\n. While successful in stationary manipulation\n[\n10\n]\n, these methods struggle when applied to long-horizon mobile manipulation\n[\n21\n]\n. A primary challenge is\noptimization interference\n: optimizing a single monolithic network to simultaneously handle LiDAR-based navigation and Vision-based manipulation often leads to conflicting gradients\n[\n22\n]\n, causing convergence failure or sub-optimal policies.\nAlternatively, Imitation Learning (IL) bypasses the exploration difficulty by mimicking expert demonstrations. Algorithms ranging from classical Behavior Cloning to Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL)\n[\n5\n]\nand the recent Diffusion Policy\n[\n3\n]\nhave demonstrated impressive capabilities. However, IL suffers from two fundamental limitations in industrial settings: (1)\nCovariate Shift\n: slight deviations during execution lead to state distributions not covered in the training data, causing compounding errors\n[\n14\n]\n; and (2)\nPrecision Bottleneck\n: the policy is strictly upper-bounded by the quality of the dataset\n[\n12\n]\nand lacks an online correction mechanism to achieve the sub-centimeter accuracy required for stacking. To address these, our work employs a hybrid strategy: we use IL for stable initialization and RL for fine-tuning, enabling the agent to exceed expert precision via residual learning.\nII-C\nHierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL)\nTo address the temporal abstraction challenge, HRL decomposes complex decision-making into high-level planning and low-level skills\n[\n2\n]\n. Traditional approaches focus on sequencing pre-defined primitives, such as the Options framework\n[\n17\n]\nor FeUdal Networks\n[\n20\n]\n. More recently, researchers have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform high-level planning, as seen in SayCan\n[\n1\n]\nand VoxPoser\n[\n6\n]\n, which ground linguistic commands into robotic affordances.\nHowever, a key gap remains in the\ncoordination of heterogeneous skills\n. Most existing HRL frameworks treat sub-policies as homogeneous blocks, ignoring the distinct sensory requirements of different phases (e.g., Geometry vs. Semantics). Furthermore, learning these hierarchies from scratch is notoriously sample-inefficient. While hybrid methods like DAPG\n[\n13\n]\nor Residual Policy Learning\n[\n7\n]\ncombine demonstrations with RL, they are rarely applied to hierarchically decoupled systems for mobile manipulation. Our work fills this gap by proposing the HMER framework. By explicitly decoupling sensor modalities for Navigation and Manipulation experts and co-optimizing them via a hybrid pipeline, we effectively solve the “cold start” problem and achieve the centimeter-level precision required for autonomous forklifts.\nIII\nPROBLEM FORMULATION\nFigure 1:\nIllustration of the Long-Horizon Material Handling Task.\nThe operational lifecycle is decomposed into four sequential phases:\n(1)\nDeparture\nfrom the docking station\n𝒫\ns\n​\nt\n​\na\n​\nr\n​\nt\n\\mathcal{P}_{start}\n;\n(2)\nSearch & Pick\nat the randomized cargo location\n𝒫\no\n​\nb\n​\nj\n\\mathcal{P}_{obj}\n;\n(3)\nTransport\nthrough dynamic obstacles; and\n(4)\nPrecision Placement\nat the target slot\n𝒫\ng\n​\no\n​\na\n​\nl\n\\mathcal{P}_{goal}\n.\nThe heterogeneous sensory inputs (LiDAR for navigation, RGB for manipulation) act as triggers for the state transitions.\nIII-A\nTask Definition\nWe formulate the autonomous mobile manipulation task as a long-horizon sequential decision-making problem within a stochastic warehouse environment. The operational lifecycle is decomposed into four distinct phases, as illustrated in Fig.\n1\n:\n1.\nDeparture:\nThe agent navigates from a docking station\n𝒫\ns\n​\nt\n​\na\n​\nr\n​\nt\n\\mathcal{P}_{start}\nto a designated transfer zone.\n2.\nSearch & Pick:\nThe agent requires visual identification and precise alignment with a target cargo initialized at a stochastic pose\n𝒫\no\n​\nb\n​\nj\n\\mathcal{P}_{obj}\n.\n3.\nTransport:\nThe loaded forklift must navigate through dynamic obstacles under kinematic constraints.\n4.\nPrecision Placement:\nThe cargo must be delivered to a storage slot\n𝒫\ng\n​\no\n​\na\n​\nl\n\\mathcal{P}_{goal}\nwith sub-centimeter accuracy.\nThe episode terminates successfully upon satisfying the placement tolerance metric, or aborts upon collision or timeout.\nIII-B\nMDP Formulation\nFormally, we model this problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) represented by the tuple\nℳ\n=\n⟨\n𝒮\n,\n𝒜\n,\n𝒫\n,\nℛ\n,\nγ\n⟩\n\\mathcal{M}=\\langle\\mathcal{S},\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{R},\\gamma\\rangle\n.\nIII-B\n1\nState Space\nThe state space\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\nis high-dimensional and heterogeneous, encapsulating the multi-modal sensory data required for different operational phases.

(\n1\n) via a monolithic End-to-End policy is ill-posed due to\noptimization interference\n. The state components\ns\nl\n​\ni\n​\nd\n​\na\n​\nr\n,\nt\ns_{lidar,t}\nand\ns\nr\n​\ng\n​\nb\n,\nt\ns_{rgb,t}\nserve conflicting objectives: global navigation dictates high sensitivity to\ns\nl\n​\ni\n​\nd\n​\na\n​\nr\n,\nt\ns_{lidar,t}\nfor maximizing traversal speed, whereas local manipulation demands strict adherence to\ns\nr\n​\ng\n​\nb\n,\nt\ns_{rgb,t}\nfor minimizing alignment error.\nCompelling a single encoder to simultaneously extract features from these disparate modalities results in\ngradient dominance\n, where the high-magnitude gradients from collision penalties suppress the learning of subtle manipulation policies. Furthermore, the reward signal for precision placement is extremely sparse, rendering unguided exploration inefficient. These theoretical challenges motivate the\nHeterogeneous Multi-Expert (HMER)\nframework, which explicitly decouples the optimization landscape into specialized sub-manifolds.\nIV\nHeterogeneous Multi-Expert Learning System\nTo address the fundamental challenges of optimization interference and sample inefficiency inherent in long-horizon mobile manipulation, we propose the\nHeterogeneous Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (HMER)\nframework. We formally model the problem as a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP), decomposing the intractable long-horizon mission into a bi-level hierarchy.\nThe core hypothesis of HMER is that conflicting spatiotemporal requirements must be resolved through\nstructural decoupling\nrather than joint optimization. By explicitly assigning macro-level geometric navigation and micro-level semantic manipulation to specialized modules, we isolate their respective gradient landscapes. As illustrated in the overall system architecture depicted in Fig.\n2\n, our framework consists of a high-level\nSemantic Task Planner\nthat operates on discrete events to constrain the solution space, and a set of low-level\nModality-Decoupled Expert Policies\nexecuting high-frequency continuous control.\nFigure 2:\nThe HMER Framework Architecture.\nThe high-level Semantic Task Planner observes discrete semantic states to orchestrate active low-level experts. Each expert is structurally decoupled, utilizing specialized encoders for distinct modalities (sparse geometric LiDAR vs. dense semantic RGB) to eliminate optimization interference.\nIV-A\nHierarchical Semantic Task Planning\nThe\nSemantic Task Planner\n, denoted as\nπ\nH\n\\pi_{H}\n, serves as the cognitive core of the system, functioning as a temporal abstraction mechanism. Formally structured as a deterministic finite state automaton governing the task lifecycle, its primary role in the learning framework is to act as a\nsemantic manifold constrainer\n.\nUnlike end-to-end approaches that must implicitly discover task sequences from high-dimensional observations, our planner explicitly encodes the logical dependencies of the material handling cycle. As detailed in the state transition logic diagram in Fig.\n3\n, the planner observes a high-level semantic state vector\ns\nH\ns_{H}\n—comprising abstract features such as topological location and discrete cargo status—to activate a specific expert skill\no\n∈\n𝒪\no\\in\\mathcal{O}\n. By conditioning expert selection on this discrete semantic state, the planner effectively masks invalid transitions, collapsing the exploration space to physically plausible sequences.\nFigure 3:\nSemantic Task Planner Logic.\nThe finite state machine governs transitions between operational phases based on semantic predicates, acting as a manifold constrainer for the learning agents.\nUpon activation at decision step\nt\nk\nt_{k}\n, the chosen expert policy\nπ\no\n\\pi_{o}\nassumes full control. The execution of skill\no\no\ncontinues until a termination condition\nβ\no\n​\n(\ns\nt\nk\n+\nk\n)\n\\beta_{o}(s_{t_{k}+k})\nis met, signaling the achievement of a sub-goal or a safety violation. This hierarchical structure bridges the gap between discrete symbolic planning and continuous sensorimotor control.\nIV-B\nModality-Decoupled Expert Skills\nA critical innovation of our system is the architectural decoupling of sensory modalities at the lower level to create distinct optimization sub-spaces. Instead of a shared encoder prone to feature collapse, we design specialized neural experts with distinct encoder backbones tailored to the topology of their specific input modality.\nIV-B\n1\nNavigation Expert (Geometric Stream)\nThe navigation policy,\nπ\nn\n​\na\n​\nv\n\\pi_{nav}\n, focuses exclusively on macro-level geometric perception for robust path planning in unstructured environments. Its state space input,\ns\nn\n​\na\n​\nv\ns_{nav}\n, combines sparse 360-degree 2D LiDAR point clouds with relative polar coordinates. We design a specialized 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) encoder to extract spatial occupancy features from the sparse scan data. This architecture intrinsically filters high-frequency visual noise irrelevant to geometric collision avoidance. The policy outputs velocity commands optimized via a dense reward function\nR\nn\n​\na\n​\nv\nR_{nav}\nincentivizing efficiency and smoothness.\nIV-B\n2\nPicking Expert (Semantic Stream)\nThe picking policy,\nπ\np\n​\ni\n​\nc\n​\nk\n\\pi_{pick}\n, governs fine-grained interaction, requiring high-resolution semantic understanding for 6-DoF alignment. Unlike navigation, its input\ns\np\n​\ni\n​\nc\n​\nk\ns_{pick}\nis derived primarily from dense RGB camera data. We utilize a deep 2D-CNN ResNet backbone to extract complex texture and edge features necessary for precise object pose estimation. The policy outputs synchronized chassis and lift control actions. To ensure robustness against approach errors, the reward\nR\np\n​\ni\n​\nc\n​\nk\nR_{pick}\nis formulated as a pose minimization problem, utilizing quaternion arithmetic to enforce precise angular alignment.\nIV-B\n3\nPlacing Expert (Precision Stream)\nThe placing policy,\nπ\np\n​\nl\n​\na\n​\nc\n​\ne\n\\pi_{place}\n, addresses the “precision bottleneck” of industrial stacking, where sub-centimeter accuracy is mandatory. Standard distance-based reward functions suffer from vanishing gradients as the error approaches zero, halting learning near the target. To overcome this, we introduce a novel\nReciprocal Reward Formulation\n:\nR\np\n​\nl\n​\na\n​\nc\n​\ne\n​\n(\ns\nt\n)\n=\nλ\np\n​\nr\n​\ne\n​\nc\nd\nt\n​\na\n​\nr\n​\ng\n​\ne\n​\nt\n​\n(\ns\nt\n)\n+\nϵ\ns\n​\nt\n​\na\n​\nb\n+\nR\ns\n​\nu\n​\nc\n​\nc\n​\ne\n​\ns\n​\ns\nR_{place}(s_{t})=\\frac{\\lambda_{prec}}{d_{target}(s_{t})+\\epsilon_{stab}}+R_{success}\n(2)\nwhere\nd\nt\n​\na\n​\nr\n​\ng\n​\ne\n​\nt\nd_{target}\nquantifies the combined Euclidean and angular deviation. This formulation generates increasingly sharp gradients as\nd\nt\n​\na\n​\nr\n​\ng\n​\ne\n​\nt\n→\n0\nd_{target}\\to 0\n, providing a strong, continuous optimization signal that incentivizes the agent to relentlessly refine its position to the sub-centimeter level.\nIV-C\nHybrid Imitation-Reinforcement Training Strategy\nTraining this multi-expert system from scratch is non-trivial due to the extreme sparsity of the global task reward and high-dimensional state space. We introduce a two-stage\nHybrid Imitation-Reinforcement Strategy\n, depicted in the training pipeline in Fig.\n4\n, addressing the exploration-exploitation paradox in hierarchical learning.\nFigure 4:\nHybrid Imitation-Reinforcement Training Strategy.\nPhase 1 utilizes Behavioral Cloning for stable manifold initialization. Phase 2 employs PPO for end-to-end residual refinement, enabling the experts to learn complex contact dynamics.\nIV-C\n1\nPhase 1: Manifold Initialization via Behavioral Cloning\nWe first define a safe operating manifold by cloning the behavior of rule-based heuristic experts. We collect a dataset of successful demonstrations and optimize each expert policy to minimize the Negative Log-Likelihood of the expert actions. This supervised learning phase rapidly initializes the neural weights, ensuring agents possess baseline kinematic understanding and reducing early-stage catastrophic failures.\nIV-C\n2\nPhase 2: Contact-Rich Refinement via PPO\nHeuristic demonstrations are inherently sub-optimal and fail to model complex contact dynamics essential for high-precision insertion. To surpass this baseline, we transition to Reinforcement Learning for\nresidual refinement\n. In this phase, the pre-trained agents explore the state space around the cloned trajectories, discovering non-intuitive micro-adjustments to handle complex physical interactions. We maximize the expected cumulative reward using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). This phase is critical for bridging the gap between idealized heuristic planning and the physical realities of high-precision industrial manipulation.\nV\nExperimental Setup and Implementation Details\nTo ensure the reproducibility of our results and provide a rigorous benchmark for the proposed HMER framework, we detail the high-fidelity simulation environment, the specialized neural architectures designed for heterogeneous modalities, and the practical implementation protocols of the hybrid training strategy.

This structure is designed to capture rich semantic cues such as object edges and textures. The resulting flattened spatial latent features are fused with the proprioceptive fork height state.\nV-B\n3\nPlacing Expert (Precision Stream)\nDemanding centimeter-level accuracy, the input\ns\np\n​\nl\n​\na\n​\nc\n​\ne\ns_{place}\nis a low-dimensional vector representing the relative 6-DoF pose error derived from the perception system. Unlike visual agents, this compact state vector does not require convolutional processing and is fed directly into a\nMulti-Layer Perceptron (MLP)\nencoder to project the raw state into a dense latent embedding optimized for precise coordinate corrections.\nFor all experts, the specialized embeddings are fed into separate MLP networks for the Actor and Critic heads. The Actor outputs the mean\nμ\n\\mu\nof a diagonal Gaussian distribution, while the log-standard deviation\nσ\n\\sigma\nis learned as a state-independent parameter.\nV-C\nImplementation of the Hybrid Training Protocol\nTo ensure stable convergence in this multi-stage curriculum, we implement specific protocols for phase transition and signal normalization.\nV-C\n1\nPhase 1: Kinematic Manifold Initialization (BC)\nWe utilize the expert dataset solely to initialize the policy network weights into a\nSafe Kinematic Manifold\n. The primary goal here is not perfect imitation, but to endow the agent with basic functional competency to prevent immediate collisions during early RL exploration. We employ a relatively high learning rate (\nα\nb\n​\nc\n=\n1\n×\n10\n−\n3\n\\alpha_{bc}=1\\times 10^{-3}\n) to rapidly fit the expert’s geometric paths. This phase is terminated early (after 50 epochs) to prevent the policy from overfitting to the expert’s inherent sub-optimality.\nV-C\n2\nPhase 2: Residual Refinement via PPO\nUpon transitioning to PPO for residual learning, we introduce two critical mechanisms to manage the competing optimization processes of different experts:\n•\nRunning Reward Normalization:\nSince navigation tasks (measured in meters) and manipulation tasks (measured in radians or pixels) operate on vastly different scales, their raw reward signals are heterogeneous. We implement running mean-variance normalization for the rewards of each expert independently. This ensures that the advantage estimates across different skills share a similar magnitude, preventing the optimizer from biasing towards the task with larger raw reward magnitudes.\n•\nLearning Rate Annealing:\nTo perform fine-grained residual learning without destroying the structural knowledge acquired during the BC phase, we anneal the learning rate linearly from an initial\nα\nr\n​\nl\n=\n1\n×\n10\n−\n4\n\\alpha_{rl}=1\\times 10^{-4}\nto zero over the course of training.\nVI\nExperimental Evaluation\nIn this section, we present a rigorous quantitative evaluation of the proposed HMER framework. Utilizing the high-fidelity Gazebo simulation environment detailed in Section\nV\n, we aim to answer three critical research questions:\n•\nQ1 (Training Efficiency):\nDoes the hybrid imitation-reinforcement strategy effectively resolve the cold-start exploration problem and accelerate convergence compared to learning from scratch?\n•\nQ2 (Overall Performance):\nCan the structurally decoupled architecture achieve superior task success rates and operational efficiency compared to monolithic or sequential baselines?\n•\nQ3 (Precision & Robustness):\nDoes the system meet strict industrial standards for placement accuracy (sub-2.0 cm) and maintain robustness under environmental perturbations?\nVI-A\nExperimental Baselines\nWe evaluate the framework in a\n20\n​\nm\n×\n20\n​\nm\n20m\\times 20m\nsimulated warehouse populated with static storage racks and dynamic obstacles. The objective is to complete a full Departure-Pick-Transport-Place cycle. To comprehensively validate the specific contributions of the HMER framework—namely the Semantic Task Planner, Modality Decoupling, and the Hybrid Training strategy—we compare it against five distinct baselines:\n1.\nFlat-BC (Monolithic Imitation):\nAn end-to-end policy trained solely via Behavioral Cloning. It maps stacked raw sensor inputs (LiDAR + RGB) directly to motor actions using a single large network. This baseline highlights the impact of modality interference and the covariate shift inherent in non-hierarchical imitation.\n2.\nRule-Based (Sequential Heuristics):\nA traditional modular approach executing classical algorithms in a fixed sequence: A* planning for navigation and heuristic visual servoing for manipulation. This baseline acts as the ”Expert” for generating demonstration data and serves as a benchmark for adaptability and execution speed.\n3.\nHBC (Hierarchical Imitation):\nIncorporates the same hierarchical architecture as HMER (Semantic Planner + Experts) but is trained exclusively via Behavioral Cloning (Phase 1 only), without RL fine-tuning. This evaluates the precision bottleneck of pure supervised learning.\n4.\nHRL (Hierarchical RL from Scratch):\nThe complete HMER architecture trained solely using PPO (Phase 2 only), without the warm-start initialization from demonstrations. This tests the necessity of the hybrid strategy in overcoming exploration sparsity.\n5.\nSeq-Hybrid (w/o Semantic Planner):\nA variation where the Heterogeneous Experts are trained via the full hybrid strategy but executed in a fixed, open-loop sequence without the high-level Semantic Task Planner. This validates the necessity of the semantic layer for state-aware transitions and error recovery.\n6.\nHMER (Ours):\nThe proposed full framework featuring the Semantic Task Planner, Modality-Decoupled Experts, and the unified Hybrid Imitation-Reinforcement training strategy.\nFigure 5:\nTraining Dynamics Analysis.\nTask success rate vs. environment interaction steps. HMER (Ours) achieves faster convergence and higher asymptotic performance compared to HRL from scratch, while monolithic baselines fail to learn.\nVI-B\nTraining Dynamics Analysis\nWe first analyze the sample efficiency of the proposed training pipeline, as illustrated in Fig.\n5\nshowing task success rates over 10 million interaction steps.\nThe results clearly demonstrate the challenge of long-horizon mobile manipulation. The Flat-BC baseline fails to generalize, stagnating below 15% success, confirming that simple imitation cannot handle compounding errors in complex tasks. The HRL (From Scratch) agent demonstrates extremely slow convergence, requiring approximately 8.0 million steps to reach an 85% success rate, highlighting the difficulty of exploration in sparse-reward settings.\nIn contrast, HMER (Ours) starts at a robust baseline of approximately 65% (inherited from the stable kinematic manifold of the BC phase) and rapidly converges to its peak performance of 94.2% within just 4.5 million steps. This represents a 43.7% reduction in training samples to reach asymptotic performance compared to HRL, validating the critical role of the warm-start strategy in resolving the cold-start problem.\nVI-C\nQuantitative Performance Comparison\nWe conducted 500 separate evaluation episodes with randomized start and target poses for each method. The comprehensive quantitative results are summarized in Table\nII\n.\nTABLE II:\nOVERALL PERFORMANCE COMPARISON (500 Evaluation Trials)\nMethod\nTask Success Rate\n(\n↑\n\\uparrow\n)\nAvg.

N/A indicates the method rarely completed the task. Best results are highlighted in bold.\nVI-C\n1\nTask Success and Efficiency\nAs shown in Table\nII\n, HMER achieves the highest task success rate of 94.2%, significantly outperforming the Rule-Based expert (84.2%) and the open-loop Seq-Hybrid baseline (68.5%). The poor performance of Seq-Hybrid highlights the necessity of the Semantic Task Planner; without closed-loop state monitoring, minor failures in the pick phase propagate irreversibly, leading to high collision rates during transport.\nRegarding operational efficiency, HMER achieves an average cycle time of 42.5s. This constitutes a 23.6% reduction compared to the Rule-Based expert (55.6s). This efficiency gain stems from the concurrent optimization of all phases via RL: the Navigation Expert learns to cut corners and optimize path curvature better than A*, while the Manipulation Experts develop smoother, non-stop interaction policies compared to the stop-and-wait logic of visual servoing.\nVI-C\n2\nPlacement Precision and Robustness\nTerminal accuracy is the most critical metric for industrial viability. The methods relying solely on imitation (Rule-Based and HBC) plateau at a mean placement error of approximately 4.0 cm, limited by the quality of the heuristic demonstrations and sensor noise.\nBy leveraging Residual Learning with the proposed reciprocal reward, both HRL and HMER reduce this error significantly to 1.5 cm, meeting strict industrial tolerances. The error distribution analysis (referenced in Fig.\n6\n) reveals that 88% of successful HMER episodes result in an error of less than 2.0 cm, compared to only 25% for the Rule-Based baseline. This confirms that the contact-rich refinement phase enables the agent to learn superior micro-adjustment strategies that exceed the capabilities of the supervisor.\nFigure 6:\nPlacement Accuracy Distribution.\nCumulative distribution function (CDF) of final placement error. HMER significantly outperforms imitation-based methods, achieving sub-2cm precision in the majority of trials.\nVI-D\nAblation Analysis\nTo systematically isolate the contributions of framework components, we analyze the performance drops in the ablated variants presented in Table\nII\n.\nImpact of Modality Decoupling:\nThe catastrophic failure of the Flat-BC baseline (12.4% success) compared to the hierarchical HBC baseline (76.5% success) provides empirical evidence for the necessity of structural decoupling. Forcing a single network to process conflicting geometric and semantic gradients leads to optimization interference, preventing the learning of even basic kinematic behaviors.\nImpact of Hybrid Training:\nComparing HBC, HRL, and HMER reveals the distinct roles of the two training phases. HBC shows that BC alone provides stable but sub-optimal capability (high precision error). HRL shows that RL alone achieves high precision but suffers from sample inefficiency and high early-stage training variance. HMER combines the best of both, utilizing BC for robust initialization and RL for precision capability, resulting in the highest overall success rate.\nImpact of Semantic Planning:\nThe comparison between Seq-Hybrid and HMER isolates the role of the high-level planner. While Seq-Hybrid achieves excellent precision and speed when it succeeds, its low success rate (68.5%) and high collision rate (28.4%) indicate brittleness. The Semantic Task Planner in HMER acts as a crucial safety layer, enabling error recovery (e.g., retrying a failed grasp instead of proceeding to transport), which is essential for robustness in unstructured environments.\nVII\nConclusion\nFuture work will focus on two main directions. We aim to transfer the learned policies to a real-world forklift platform using Sim-to-Real techniques such as Domain Randomization and Domain Adaptation. Additionally, we plan to extend the high-level policy to handle multi-agent coordination, enabling a fleet of autonomous forklifts to collaborate efficiently in dynamic, shared workspaces.\nIn this work, we addressed the fundamental challenge of autonomous mobile manipulation in unstructured warehouses, where the conflicting requirements of large-scale navigation and high-precision stacking create a significant barrier for monolithic learning approaches. We proposed a Collaborative Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (CMRL) framework tailored for autonomous forklifts. By decoupling the sensory processing streams, we successfully resolved the ”Modality Interference” problem, enabling a geometry-aware Navigation Expert and semantics-aware Manipulation Experts to cooperate seamlessly under a semantic task sequencer. Furthermore, our ”Imitate-then-Reinforce” hybrid training strategy proved effective in solving the exploration-precision trade-off. We demonstrated that while Imitation Learning provides a safe kinematic initialization, the subsequent Residual Learning phase is indispensable for mastering the contact-rich dynamics required for industrial-grade precision.\nExtensive evaluations in a high-fidelity Gazebo simulation validated the efficacy of our approach. The CMRL system achieved a task success rate of 94.2 %, significantly outperforming end-to-end baselines (12.4%) which failed to converge due to gradient conflicts. Most notably, our method broke the precision ceiling of heuristic experts, reducing the placement error to 1.5 cm and meeting strict industrial tolerances. The system also demonstrated superior operational efficiency, reducing the cycle time by 21.4% compared to sequential execution baselines, and exhibited robust performance even under severe environmental perturbations.\nDespite these promising results, we acknowledge several limitations. First, our validation is currently restricted to simulation. While we modeled physics fidelity carefully, real-world factors such as sensor latency and uneven floor friction may introduce discrepancies. Second, the current high-level sequencer operates on a discrete logic basis; it does not yet possess the capability to learn continuous, creative recovery strategies outside its pre-defined semantic transitions.\nFuture work will focus on two primary directions. To bridge the Sim-to-Real gap, we plan to implement domain adaptation techniques to transfer the visual encoders to physical hardware. Additionally, we aim to extend the framework to Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, coordinating a fleet of autonomous forklifts to optimize global warehouse throughput while managing traffic congestion in shared workspaces.\nReferences\n[1]\nM.

    "preview_text": "Autonomous mobile manipulation in unstructured warehouses requires a balance between efficient large-scale navigation and high-precision object interaction. Traditional end-to-end learning approaches often struggle to handle the conflicting demands of these distinct phases. Navigation relies on robust decision-making over large spaces, while manipulation needs high sensitivity to fine local details. Forcing a single network to learn these different objectives simultaneously often causes optimization interference, where improving one task degrades the other. To address these limitations, we propose a Heterogeneous Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (HMER) framework tailored for autonomous forklifts. HMER decomposes long-horizon tasks into specialized sub-policies controlled by a Semantic Task Planner. This structure separates macro-level navigation from micro-level manipulation, allowing each expert to focus on its specific action space without interference. The planner coordinates the sequential execution of these experts, bridging the gap between task planning and continuous control. Furthermore, to solve the problem of sparse exploration, we introduce a Hybrid Imitation-Reinforcement Training Strategy. This method uses expert demonstrations to initialize the policy and Reinforcement Learning for fine-tuning. Experiments in Gazebo simulations show that HMER significantly outperforms sequential and end-to-end baselines. Our method achieves a task success rate of 94.2\\% (compared to 62.5\\% for baselines), reduces operation time by 21.4\\%, and maintains placement error within 1.5 cm, validating its efficacy for precise material handling.\n\n\\useunder\n\\ul\nHeterogeneous Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning for Long-Horizon Multi-Goal Tasks in Autonomous Forklifts\nYun Chen, Bowei Huang, Fan Guo, Kang Song\nThis work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2022YFE0100100, the Tianjin Municipal Science and Technology Pro",

            "answer": "## 论文技术脉络与发展方向梳理\n\n本文提出的**异构多专家强化学习（HMER）**框架，是针对自主叉车长时程、多目标任务的解决方案。其核心在于**结构化解耦**与**混合训练**，以解决移动操作中**导航（大尺度几何）**与**操作（精细语义）**之间的**优化干扰**问题。基于其内容与前作（相关工作中引用的文献），可以梳理出该领域从**经典规划**到**数据驱动学习**，再到**分层与混合方法**的演进脉络，主要沿着三个发展方向深化。\n\n### 发展脉络与核心改进\n\n#### 方向一：从**基于模型的经典规划**到**数据驱动的感知-动作端到端学习**\n*   **前作代表**：任务与运动规划（TAMP）方法，如 Kaelbling & Lozano-Pérez (2011, 2013) 和 Garrett 等人 (2021) 的工作。\n*   **核心思想**：将任务分解为符号化的动作序列，并为每个动作求解连续的运动轨迹。依赖精确的环境模型（高清地图、3D物体模型）和状态估计。\n*   **局限性**：在非结构化、动态环境中缺乏灵活性，严重依赖“特权信息”，难以适应仓库布局动态变化。\n*   **本文的改进与定位**：HMER框架**摒弃了对精确先验模型的依赖**，完全依靠车载传感器（LiDAR, RGB）进行在线感知与决策。它通过**语义任务规划器**实现了类似TAMP的**逻辑序列控制**，但底层是数据驱动的策略，从而兼具了任务的结构性和对动态环境的适应性。\n\n#### 方向二：从**单一的端到端学习**到**分层的、异构的专家系统**\n*   **前作代表**：\n    1.  **端到端RL**：Levine等人 (2016) 尝试直接从原始传感器映射到控制动作，但在长时程任务中易受优化干扰（Yu等人， 2020）。\n    2.  **分层RL（HRL）**：如Options框架 (Sutton等人， 1999)、FeUdal网络 (Vezhnevets等人， 2017)，以及结合LLM的规划方法（如SayCan [Ahn等人， 2022]）。\n*   **核心思想与局限性**：\n    *   **端到端RL**：单一网络处理异构模态（几何vs语义）导致**梯度冲突**，难以同时优化冲突的目标。\n    *   **传统HRL**：虽进行了时间抽象，但常将子策略视为同质模块，**忽略了不同阶段（导航/操作）在感知模态和优化目标上的根本差异**，未能彻底解决模态干扰。\n*   **本文的改进**：HMER的核心创新在于**显式的模态解耦**。它并非简单的时间分层，而是**结构分层**：\n    *   **导航专家**：专用1D-CNN处理稀疏LiDAR点云，专注于几何空间占用和避障。\n    *   **操作专家（拾取/放置）**：专用2D-CNN（如ResNet）处理稠密RGB图像，专注于语义理解和精细对齐。\n    *   **改进点**：通过为不同专家设计**专用编码器架构**，从根本上**隔离了梯度更新空间**，解决了优化干扰问题。这是对传统HRL将子策略“同质化”假设的重要突破。\n\n#### 方向三：从**纯模仿学习**或**纯强化学习**到**混合模仿-强化训练策略**\n*   **前作代表**：\n    1.  **模仿学习（IL）**：包括行为克隆（BC）、生成对抗模仿学习（GAIL, Ho & Ermon， 2016）和扩散策略（Diffusion Policy, Chi等人， 2023）。受限于**协变量偏移**和**演示者性能瓶颈**（Mandlekar等人， 2021）。\n    2.  **纯强化学习（RL）**：在稀疏奖励的长时程任务中面临**探索效率极低**的“冷启动”问题。\n    3.  **混合方法尝试**：如DAPG (Rajeswaran等人， 2018) 和残差策略学习（Johannink等人， 2019），但它们多用于单一策略或未在解耦的异构系统中充分应用。\n*   **核心思想与局限性**：IL稳定但性能有上限，RL潜力大但探索难。先前混合方法多关注于为单一策略提供辅助。\n*   **本文的改进**：提出了**统一的、针对分层异构系统的混合训练策略**：\n    1.  **阶段1（BC初始化）**：用启发式规则演示初始化各专家策略，快速建立**安全运动流形**，解决RL冷启动问题。\n    2.  **阶段2（PPO微调）**：在BC提供的安全基线之上，进行**残差精修**。关键改进在于引入了**倒数奖励函数**，在接近目标时提供更强的梯度信号，使智能体能够**学习到超越演示者（启发式规则）的、应对复杂接触动力学的微调策略**，从而突破模仿学习的精度瓶颈。\n    3.  **系统性整合**：该策略被应用于整个解耦的专家系统，并配合**运行奖励归一化**等技术，协调多个专家的异步优化过程。\n\n### 着重发展的几个不同方向总结\n\n1.  **架构设计方向：从“时间分层”到“模态与结构解耦”**\n    *   **演进**：传统HRL关注“何时做什么”（时间抽象），本文的HMER进一步深入为“用什么感知做什么，以及如何最优地做”（模态与结构抽象）。\n    *   **价值**：更贴近移动操作任务的物理本质，通过专用网络架构实现更干净、更高效的优化，是提升性能的基础。\n\n2.  **训练范式方向：从“孤立学习”到“协同的课程化混合学习”**\n    *   **演进**：将模仿学习（提供安全性与先验）和强化学习（提供优化与超越能力）不再是替代或简单拼接，而是设计为一个**有序的课程**：BC奠定基础，RL精修突破。同时，该范式被**系统性地应用于一个异构专家系统**。\n    *   **价值**：同时解决了长时程任务中的**探索稀疏性**和**工业级精度要求**两大难题，实现了样本效率与最终性能的平衡。\n\n3.  **系统集成方向：从“开环序列”到“闭环语义任务规划”**\n    *   **演进**：相较于简单的模块顺序执行（易误差传播、无法恢复），HMER引入了**基于语义状态的有限状态机**作为高层规划器。\n    *   **价值**：它**桥接了离散任务逻辑与连续控制**，能够根据高层语义状态（如“是否成功抓取”）动态切换专家并启动错误恢复流程，显著提升了在非结构化环境中的**鲁棒性**。这相较于完全依赖学习隐含序列的端到端方法更具可解释性和可靠性。\n\n**结论**：本文的HMER框架代表了自主移动操作领域一个重要的融合与深化方向。它并非单一技术的突破，而是**将异构架构设计、混合训练策略和闭环语义规划三者系统性地整合**，针对工业场景（如无人叉车）的核心痛点——**效率、精度、鲁棒性**——提供了完整的解决方案。其发展脉络清晰体现了从依赖模型、到数据驱动、再到寻求**结构先验与数据学习最优结合**的演进趋势。",
