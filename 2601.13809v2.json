More recently, significant interest has developed in indoor UAV operations, such as inspection in industrial environments and warehouses. This has paved a way for a\na growing interest in integrating robotic grippers with the UAVs\nenabling them to manipulate objects.\nAs a result, an emerging field of aerial manipulation has captured the interest of UAV researchers, transforming UAVs into Unmanned Aerial Manipulators (UAMs)\nFigure 1\n.\nHuman Localization and Navigation by drone\nCombining the high motion agility of UAVs with the manipulability of robotic arms is an interesting yet challenging field of research. A very useful scenario of indoor UAV use is the ability to open doors; this problem has been studied in\n(Tsukagoshi et al\n.\n,\n2015\n)\nby proposing a novel force exertion scheme. Similar force exertion scenarios are studied for valve-turning operations using thrust vectoring in\n(Zhao et al\n.\n,\n2022\n)\n. Moreover, an interesting operation of UAMs is demonstrated in aerial calligraphy, as proposed in\n(Guo et al\n.\n,\n2024\n)\n. In addition to this, the most commonly studied use case is the transportation of objects using UAMs\n(Khamseh et al\n.\n,\n2018\n)\n, which also involves dealing with external forces, changes in vehicle inertia, and stability issues. A comprehensive review of UAMs discussing their utility and realization challenges is provided in\n(Khamseh et al\n.\n,\n2018\n)\nand\n(Ruggiero et al\n.\n,\n2018\n)\n. More recently, the focus of aerial manipulation has shifted to interaction and collaboration with humans. To this end, a master-slave tele-operation framework has been demonstrated on an aerial manipulator in\n(Meng et al\n.\n,\n2025\n)\n.\nAdditionally, the idea of incorporating Large Language Models (LLMs) to take prompts from humans and perform tasks in aerial manipulation seems promising. However, the reliability of such a framework is a critical challenge, especially in environments where drones interact with humans and the safety of both the human and the environment is of high concern. To this end a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based mission was proposed in\n(Mishra et al\n.\n,\n2025\n)\n, with considerable efforts to make prompt-based aerial manipulation reliable by mitigating hallucinations using structured prompting and a predefined skill library. However, this approach lacks authority over drone control, which is critical in such scenarios given the highly dynamic nature of drone flights. Quadrotor flights are prone to high disturbances, especially close to the ground and near physical objects due to downwash produced by the propellers while hovering\n(Morishita et al\n.\n,\n2024\n)\n. To address this issue, a more robust framework is required that accounts for high-level drone control using VLA similar to as demonstrated for UAV flights in\n(Sautenkov et al\n.\n,\n2025\n; Serpiva et al\n.\n,\n2025\n)\n. Therefore, in this study, we propose a conceptual Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for aerial manipulation of objects in a human-robot interaction environment. Our VLA is implemented on a quadrotor UAV equipped with a simple gripping mechanism, designed to pick up and place objects from locations such as tables and shelves. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proposal of VLA for aerial manipulation tasks.\n2.\nSystem Architecture\nThe system comprises four major subsystems: (1) hardware platform, (2) VLA-based semantic reasoning module, (3) perception pipeline with open-vocabulary detection, and (4) human-centric handover controller. Fig.\n2\nillustrates the overall system architecture.\n2.1.\nHardware Platform\nThe hardware consists of a simple rigid-body open-close gripping mechanism powered by a Dynamixel AX-12A motor mounted horizontally at the front of a quadrotor UAV.\nConsiderable care has been taken in positioning the gripper away from the drone body to avoid interference while picking up objects, this helps mitigate the downwash which effects flight stability and also cause a problem of blowing the objects away from the drone while grasping. However, a trade-off must be made between the stability of the drone and the distance of the gripper from the drone’s center of mass (COM).\nFigure 2\n.\nOverview of the VLA based aerial manipulation and Path Planning Architecture\nAll modules communicate via ROS2 topics using standard message types. The distributed architecture enables computationally intensive perception and reasoning tasks to run offboard while maintaining low-latency control loops onboard the OrangePi Fig.\n2\n.\n2.2.\nVision-Language-Action (VLA) Module\nTo enable intuitive control on resource-constrained hardware, we employ a lightweight Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model inspired by architectures such as\nTinyVLA\n(Wen et al\n.\n,\n2025\n)\n, which aims to bring multi-modal capabilities to embedded hardware. Here we propose a conceptual VLA system validated in Unity Simulation for detecting objects and grasping using a gripper.\nThe proposed VLA module accepts two primary inputs:\n•\nVisual Observation (\nI\nt\nI_{t}\n):\nA time-indexed RGB image stream captured from the onboard RealSense camera. Prior to fusion, the visual stream is down-sampled to\n224\n×\n224\n224\\times 224\nresolution and encoded using a compact convolutional visual backbone.\n•\nLanguage Prompt (\nL\nL\n):\nA natural language instruction from the operator specifying an object and intended action (e.g., ’pick up the red screwdriver’). In the current prototype, text is supplied via keyboard input.\nThe VLA architecture is deployed on the ground station rather than onboard the UAV, enabling increased model complexity without incurring latency or power constraints on the aerial platform. The TinyVLA is composed of a 6-layer ViT-Tiny visual encoder (patch size 16×16, 192-dim latent) and a 4-layer text transformer (256-dim hidden, 8 attention heads) for natural language prompt processing. Visual frames streamed from the RealSense camera over Wi-Fi are downsampled to 224×224 resolution and processed asynchronously at 15–20 Hz. The fused latent representation is passed through a 2-layer MLP action policy head that predicts discrete gripper actions Open,Close. The resulting model executes with sub-5 ms inference on a desktop-class RTX GPU. The ground station deployment also allows future expansion of the action vocabulary, multi-object grounding, and affordance reasoning without modifying the UAV flight stack.\nGiven the single-degree-of-freedom parallel gripper mounted beneath the quadrotor, the output action space is defined as a binary actuator command:\n(1)\na\nt\n=\nπ\n​\n(\nI\nt\n,\nL\n)\n∈\nOpen\n,\nClose\na_{t}=\\pi(I_{t},L)\\in{\\text{Open},\\ \\text{Close}}\nAs evident from the action-space, the VLA implements a simple opening and closing action upon detection of being in the vicinity of the object of interest. Meanwhile, spatial positioning and approach trajectory are handled by a human-centric controller driven by MediaPipe as illustrated in Fig.\n2\nand explained in the subsequent sections. This architecture decouples semantic manipulation reasoning from UAV stabilization and navigation, and serves as a first step that can be extended to a more general end-to-end architecture to apply a full 5-DOF control, that includes velocities in the x,y,z coordinates,yaw angular rate, and gripper state.\nThis direct mapping from perception to actuation allows the VLA to focus exclusively on grasping logic. The VLA continuously infers the correct gripper state based on the visual proximity to the object described in the text prompt, while the drone’s position controller handles the approach trajectory independently.\n2.3.\nPerception Pipeline: Open-Vocabulary Detection and 3D Localization\nTraditional object detection systems typically require retraining for new object categories. To enable true open-vocabulary manipulation, we integrate\nGrounding DINO\n(Liu et al\n.\n,\n2024\n)\n, a transformer-based open-set object detector that performs cross-modal fusion of vision and language features. Grounding DINO takes as input:\nRGB images\nfrom RealSense cameras, and\ntext prompts\nspecifying target objects(e.g., ”red cup”, ”person in red shirt”, ”screwdriver”).\nThe detector outputs bounding boxes with confidence scores for all instances that match the text query. This enables zero-shot detection of arbitrary objects without task-specific training.\n3D Localization:\nFor each bounding boxes detected by Grounding DINO, we compute the centroid of bounding box in image coordinates\n(\nu\n,\nv\n)\n(u,v)\n, query the aligned depth map at\n(\nu\n,\nv\n)\n(u,v)\nto obtain depth\nd\nd\n, deproject to 3D camera coordinates and transform from camera frame to world frame using ROS2 TF2 transforms.\nThis pipeline provides real-time 3D positions of the target objects and humans in the global reference frame, enabling subsequent visual servoing control.\n2.4.\nHuman-Centric Handover Controller\nSafe and natural human-robot handover requires understanding the human’s pose, orientation, and preferred interaction geometry. We employ\nMediaPipe Pose Landmarker\nto estimate human pose in real-time.\nMediaPipe outputs: 33 skeletal keypoints in both normalized 2D image coordinates and 3D world coordinates, body orientation computed from shoulder and hip joint vectors, and Hand position estimate to determine handover side preference as shown in Fig.\n3\n.\nFigure 3\n.\nGrounding DINO bounding box object detection and humans in RGB images from drone cameras\nHuman Orientation Estimation:\nLet\n𝐩\nleft_shoulder\n\\mathbf{p}_{\\text{left\\_shoulder}}\nand\n𝐩\nright_shoulder\n\\mathbf{p}_{\\text{right\\_shoulder}}\ndenote the 3D positions of the left and right shoulder landmarks, the arc-tangent of the difference of these landmarks is used to compute the torso forward direction (yaw angle):\n(2)\n𝐯\ntorso\n=\n𝐩\nright_shoulder\n−\n𝐩\nleft_shoulder\n,\n\\mathbf{v}_{\\text{torso}}=\\mathbf{p}_{\\text{right\\_shoulder}}-\\mathbf{p}_{\\text{left\\_shoulder}},\n(3)\nθ\nyaw\n=\narctan\n​\n(\n𝐯\ntorso\n,\ny\n,\n𝐯\ntorso\n,\nx\n)\n\\theta_{\\text{yaw}}=\\text{arctan}(\\mathbf{v}_{\\text{torso},y},\\mathbf{v}_{\\text{torso},x})\nThe perpendicular direction to the torso indicates the person’s facing direction.\nHandover Pose Computation:\nBased on HRI handover literature\n(Strabala et al\n.\n,\n2013\n; Nemlekar et al\n.\n,\n2019\n)\n, we compute a target handover pose in form of Distance (approximately 0.6-0.8, in from of the human), Height (Chest level at approximately 1.0-1.3m from ground), and orientation (Drone faces human directly, aligned with human’s facing direction)\nThe target handover pose in the world frame is:\n(4)\n𝐩\nhandover\nW\n=\n𝐩\nhuman\nW\n+\nd\nhandover\n⋅\n[\ncos\n⁡\n(\nθ\nyaw\n+\nπ\n)\nsin\n⁡\n(\nθ\nyaw\n+\nπ\n)\n0\n]\n+\n[\n0\n0\nh\nchest\n]\n,\n{}^{W}\\mathbf{p}_{\\text{handover}}={}^{W}\\mathbf{p}_{\\text{human}}+d_{\\text{handover}}\\cdot\\begin{bmatrix}\\cos(\\theta_{\\text{yaw}}+\\pi)\\\\\n\\sin(\\theta_{\\text{yaw}}+\\pi)\\\\\n0\\end{bmatrix}+\\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\\n0\\\\\nh_{\\text{chest}}\\end{bmatrix},\nwhere\nd\nhandover\nd_{\\text{handover}}\nis the desired standoff distance and\nh\nchest\nh_{\\text{chest}}\nis the vertical offset to chest height.\nVisual Servoing Control\n:\nWe implement a hybrid servoing approach combining\nposition-based visual servoing (PBVS)\nand\nimage-based visual servoing (IBVS)\n.\nThe\nPBVS\nis used for coarse navigation to the object and handover locations using 3D pose estimates from depth cameras.\nWhile the\nIBVS\nis used for fine alignment during grasping and handover, directly using 2D image features to minimize drift and maintain object/human visibility.\nThe image-based error\n𝐞\nimg\n=\n𝐬\n−\n𝐬\n∗\n\\mathbf{e}_{\\text{img}}=\\mathbf{s}-\\mathbf{s}^{*}\n(current vs. desired feature positions) drives the control.\nSafety checks and failure recovery behaviors (e.g., lost object detection, communication timeout) are integrated at each state transition.\n2.5.\nMotion planning with human awareness\nThe global motion planner operates in the horizontal plane using a\ngrid–based A* search. The room\n[\nx\nmin\n,\nx\nmax\n]\n×\n[\ny\nmin\n,\ny\nmax\n]\n[x_{\\min},x_{\\max}]\\times[y_{\\min},y_{\\max}]\nis discretized into a\nuniform occupancy grid with resolution\nΔ\n\\Delta\n, where each cell\nrepresents a candidate drone position and the occupancy value\n𝑜𝑐𝑐\n​\n(\ni\n,\nj\n)\n∈\n{\n0\n,\n1\n}\n\\mathit{occ}(i,j)\\in\\{0,1\\}\nencodes free space or collision.\nCircular obstacles are rasterized by marking all cells whose centers lie\nwithin the corresponding radius; in particular, the human is modeled as\na cylindrical obstacle with radius equal to the physical body radius\nplus an additional safety margin, enforcing a minimum stand-off distance\nthroughout the mission. For each leg of the task (home–object,\nobject–human, human–home), continuous start and goal positions are\nprojected to the nearest free cells and A* is run on the 8-connected\ngrid with unit cost for axial moves and\n2\n\\sqrt{2}\nfor diagonal moves,\nand a Euclidean heuristic in grid index space. The resulting sequence of\ncells is converted back to world coordinates and passed through a\nline-of-sight smoothing step, which\nremoves redundant waypoints while preserving collision-free straight\nsegments. The final polyline is then sent to the low-level controller as\na sequence of position setpoints with altitude specified by the mission\nlogic.\n3.\nSystem Evaluation\n3.1.\nExperimental Procedure\nSetup.\nExperiments were conducted in an indoor laboratory space of approximately\n6\n​\nm\n×\n6\n​\nm\n6~\\mathrm{m}\\times 6~\\mathrm{m}\nequipped with an overhead Vicon motion\ncapture system, which provided ground–truth pose for the drone, the table,\nand the human participant. A rectangular table was placed in the center of\nthe workspace and populated with\n15\n15\n–\n20\n20\neveryday objects (cups, tools,\nplants etc) arranged in different configurations. A human stood at a\ndesignated handover location approximately\n2\n​\nm\n2~\\mathrm{m}\nfrom the table.\nThe onboard perception stack (Grounding DINO, depth sensing, and\nMediaPipe) and the human–aware A* motion planner were evaluated jointly as\nan integrated pipeline for scene surveying, object and human localization,\nand safe navigation.\nTrials.\nWe conducted\nN\n=\n10\nN=10\ntrials with randomized object\narrangements. Each trial consisted of:\n(1)\nAutonomous take-off and survey of the workspace;\n(2)\nObject and human identification, classification, and localization;\n(3)\nMotion planning and execution from home to object, object grasp,\nand human-aware navigation from object to human;\n(4)\nLogging of trial outcome (success/failure), execution time, and\nfailure mode (if any).\nAll onboard sensor data, perception outputs, and control commands were\nrecorded as ROS 2 bag files for offline analysis. Vicon trajectories were\ntime-synchronized with the drone’s onboard logs to enable quantitative\nevaluation of perception accuracy and motion-planning performance.\n3.2.\nDiscussion\nIn the experiments performed, we demonstrated a fully functioning, end-to-end MediaPipe based on grounding DINO for object and human identification and localization.\nRecent work such as RaceVLA\n(Serpiva et al\n.\n,\n2025\n)\ndemonstrate the power of end-to-end learning, where a single transformer model maps raw visual inputs directly to 4D control commands. While RaceVLA\nachieves impressive agility and human-like behaviors in high speed navigation tasks, it operates as a ”black box.” In the context to aerial manipulation, this poses a safety risk: hallucination in the VLA could result in a direct collision command. Our approach mitigates this by decoupling reasoning from actuation. By using VLA solely for semantic intent and relying on deterministic visual servoing for the\nhow\n, DroneVLA ensures drone’s motion is governed by verifiable control laws.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, systems like AERMANI-VLM used structured prompting to generate high-level reasoning traces that select discrete skill primitives. While robust for planning, these systems can suffer from rigidity in dynamic execution. DroneVLA occupies a middle ground; it employs the semantic flexibility of VLMs for object grounding but integrates tight closed-loop visual servoing to handle the continuous adjustments required for grasping.\nFigure 4\n.\n2D and 3D views of the human–aware A* motion plan,\nshowing the reference trajectory, planned path, safety\nmargins around the human and table with achieved trajectory in real flight.\nA total of 10 experiments were performed and all experiments were successfully implemented with a max error of 0.164m, a mean euclidean error of 0.070m, and a root mean squared error of 0.084m. This can be visualized in the home-to-object and object-to-human trajectories of the 2-3-D plot of Fig.\n4\n. Also it is noticeable that the drone stays a safe distance of 1 m away from the human achieving the desired safe handover trajectory.\nAlthough the VLA architecture was not implemented in the real-world flight control loop, a Unity-based simulation was performed to strictly validate the grasping policy. 10 simulation experiments were conducted where visual frames were fed to the model to verify the correctness of the predicted gripper action. In all trials, the model correctly identified the appropriate binary action (open/close) based on the image state. It is important to note that the validated VLA operates as a binary actuation model: it analyzes the received image state—whether from simulation or real-world feeds—and triggers a discrete ‘open’ or ‘close’ gripper command. This confirms the feasibility of the vision-to-action mapping and validates the model’s decision-making logic prior to physical deployment.\n4.\nConclusion and Future Work\nHaving established an end-to-end MediaPipe and Grounding DINO framework for localization in versatile environments, we proposed and validated a novel concept for VLA-based aerial manipulation. The results demonstrate the robustness of the perception stack in real-world flights and the accuracy of the VLA’s grasp validation logic, which was successfully verified on both simulated and real-world visual data. This work serves as a foundational step towards embodied aerial intelligence.\nFuture work will focus on transitioning from open-loop validation to closed-loop real-time control. Crucially, we intend to leverage this complete framework as a data collection pipeline; by recording the visual inputs and corresponding actions during these flights, we will generate a comprehensive dataset to train a custom, end-to-end VLA model for full 5-DOF control. Finally, we aim to extend this architecture to industrial domains by developing a specialist VLA model tailored for complex indoor navigation and manipulation tasks, enabling fully autonomous workflows in dynamic operational environments.\nAcknowledgements\nResearch reported in this publication was financially supported by the RSF grant No. 24-41-02039.\nReferences\n(1)\nGuo et al\n.\n(2024)\nX.

We demonstrate the system's efficacy through real-world experiments for localization and navigation, which resulted in a 0.164m, 0.070m, and 0.084m of max, mean euclidean, and root-mean squared errors, respectively, highlighting the feasibility of VLA for aerial manipulation operations.\n\nDroneVLA: VLA based Aerial Manipulation\nFawad Mehboob\nFawad.Mehboob@skoltech.ru\nSkoltech\nMoscow\nRussia\n,\nMonijesu James\nMonijesu.James@skoltech.ru\nSkoltech\nMoscow\nRussia\n,\nAmir Habel\nAmir.Habel@skoltech.ru\nSkoltech\nMoscow\nRussia\n,\nJeffrin Sam\nJeffrin.Sam@skoltech.ru\nSkoltech\nMoscow\nRussia\n,\nMiguel Altamirano Cabrera\nm.altamirano@skoltech.ru\nSkoltech\nMoscow\nRussia\nand\nDzmitry Tsetserukou\nd.tsetserukou@skoltech.ru\nSkoltech\nMoscow\nRussia\nAbstract.\nAs aerial platforms evolve from passive observers to active manip",

(2015)**：提出了具有“栖息”和“开门”能力的空中机械臂。**改进点**在于首次将机械臂与无人机深度集成，实现了非抓取式的力施加操作（如推门），突破了无人机作为纯观测平台的限制。\n    - **Khamseh et al. (2018) / Ruggiero et al. (2018)**：对空中操作领域进行了全面的综述。**改进点**在于系统性地总结了UAM的动力学挑战（如惯性变化、外部力干扰）、应用场景和实现方案，为该领域奠定了理论基础和研究框架。\n- **本阶段特点**：关注“能否操作”，重点解决**机械集成、动力学稳定性和基础力控**问题。\n\n#### 第二阶段：交互复杂化与初步智能化（2022-2024）\n**核心工作**：拓展操作任务的复杂性，并开始引入高级感知和初步的智能交互框架。\n- **代表性改进**：\n    - **Zhao et al. (2022)**：实现了带有推力矢量装置的关节式空中机器人进行“阀门旋转”操作。**改进点**在于引入了更复杂的力控策略（推力矢量），以完成需要精确力矩控制的多自由度操作任务。\n    - **Guo et al.

            "answer": "## 论文评价指标与数据集分析\n\n根据论文内容，DroneVLA 系统在真实世界实验和仿真中进行了评估。以下是其使用的评价指标和数据集的详细分析。\n\n### 一、 评价指标\n\n论文中使用的评价指标主要围绕**系统在真实飞行中的定位与导航精度**以及**仿真中VLA模块的决策正确性**。具体指标如下表所示：\n\n| 指标类别 | 具体指标 | 计算方式/定义 | 论文中报告的结果 | 细节与目的 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **定位与导航精度** | **最大欧几里得误差 (Max Euclidean Error)** | 在整个飞行轨迹中，无人机实际位置（由Vicon系统提供真值）与规划路径点之间的最大距离偏差。 | **0.164 m** | 反映了系统在最差情况下的定位偏差，用于评估系统鲁棒性和安全边界。 |\n| | **平均欧几里得误差 (Mean Euclidean Error)** | 整个飞行轨迹中，所有采样点处位置偏差的平均值。 | **0.070 m** | 衡量系统整体导航和跟踪控制器的平均性能。 |\n| | **均方根误差 (Root Mean Squared Error, RMSE)** | 位置偏差平方的平均值的平方根。对大的误差更敏感。 | **0.084 m** | 综合衡量导航精度，能更好地反映误差的波动情况。 |\n| **任务成功率** | **试验成功率 (Trial Success Rate)** | 成功完成整个“取物-递送”流程的试验次数占总试验次数的比例。 | **10/10 (100%)** | 评估端到端系统在预设场景下的整体可靠性和完成度。 |\n| **VLA决策验证** | **仿真决策正确率 (Simulation Decision Accuracy)** | 在Unity仿真中，VLA模型根据输入图像状态，正确预测夹爪“开/关”二元动作的试验比例。 | **10/10 (100%)** | 验证VLA模块的语义理解与动作映射逻辑的可行性，为后续闭环控制奠定基础。 |\n| **安全性能** | **安全距离保持 (Safety Distance Maintenance)** | 定性观察无人机在接近人类进行递送时，是否保持在预设的安全距离（约1米）之外。 | 成功保持（见图4） | 验证人机交互控制器的有效性，确保递送过程的安全性和舒适性。 |\n\n**关键细节与深度分析：**\n1.  **指标侧重工程可行性**：评价指标主要集中于**几何精度（定位误差）** 和**任务完成度（成功率）**，而非算法本身的召回率、精确度等。这符合论文作为“概念验证”和系统集成工作的定位，核心目标是证明整个软硬件架构的可行性与鲁棒性。\n2.  **真值系统权威**：定位误差的计算依赖于**Vicon运动捕捉系统**提供的毫米级精度地面真值，这保证了评价结果的可靠性和说服力。\n3.  **VLA评估的局限性**：论文明确指出，VLA模块**未在真实飞行控制回路中实现闭环**。其评估是在**Unity仿真**中进行的“开环验证”，仅测试了其基于图像状态生成正确夹爪指令的逻辑。这是本文的一个重要局限，也是未来工作的重点。\n4.  **缺乏对感知模块的定量评估**：虽然集成了Grounding DINO和MediaPipe，但论文没有单独报告这些模块的检测精度（如mAP）、召回率或处理延迟等标准计算机视觉指标。系统评估是将其作为整体管道的一部分，关注其最终输出的3D位置是否足以支持成功的导航和交互。\n\n### 二、 数据集\n\n本文**没有使用**公开的标准数据集进行训练或测试。其“数据集”来源于**自主构建的真实世界实验场景**和**仿真环境**。\n\n| 数据集类型 | 细节描述 | 用途 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **真实世界实验数据** | - **场景**：约6m x 6m的室内实验室。<br>- **布置**：中央放置一张桌子，上面随机摆放 **15-20个日常物体**（如杯子、工具、植物等）。一名人类参与者站在桌子约2米外的指定递送点。<br>- **数据记录**：通过**ROS 2 bag文件**同步记录所有机载传感器数据（RGB-D图像）、感知输出（边界框、人体关键点）、控制指令以及Vicon真值轨迹。<br>- **试验次数**：共进行 **N=10** 次试验，每次试验物体排列随机。 | 1. **系统集成测试**：评估从感知、规划到控制的端到端管道性能。<br>2. **定量分析**：用于计算导航定位误差（RMSE等）。<br>3. **定性展示**：验证安全递送、避障等功能。 |\n| **仿真验证数据** | - **平台**：Unity仿真引擎。<br>- **内容**：生成包含目标物体的视觉场景，将图像帧流式传输给VLA模型。<br>- **试验次数**：进行了 **10次仿真实验**。 | 专门用于**验证VLA模块的决策逻辑**（夹爪开/关），在部署到真实无人机前进行安全、可控的测试。 |\n| **未来计划的数据集** | 论文在“未来工作”中指出，计划利用当前系统框架作为**数据收集管道**，记录飞行中的视觉输入和对应动作，以构建一个用于训练**端到端5-DOF控制VLA模型**的数据集。 | 旨在解决当前VLA未闭环的局限，为后续模型训练提供真实世界交互数据。 |\n\n**总结**：DroneVLA 的评价指标**务实且聚焦于系统集成验证**，通过真实飞行实验的几何误差和任务成功率证明了其基础架构的可靠性。其使用的“数据集”完全是**为验证特定系统而自建的实验场景和仿真**，突出了这项工作在**实际系统搭建与集成**方面的贡献，而非在算法模型本身的训练或基准测试上。论文坦承了VLA尚未实现实时闭环控制的现状，并规划了利用当前系统收集数据以训练更高级模型的清晰路线图。",

            "question": "论文的主要局限性有哪些？未来可能的改进方向是什么？",
            "answer": "## 论文主要局限性分析\n\n基于对论文内容的分析，DroneVLA系统目前存在以下几个主要局限性：\n\n### 1. **VLA模块尚未集成到实时飞行控制回路中**\n   - **当前状态**：论文中提出的Vision-Language-Action模型仅在Unity仿真环境中进行了验证，用于测试其基于图像状态预测夹爪开/关动作的逻辑正确性。\n   - **具体表现**：VLA模块在真实飞行中并未实现**闭环实时控制**。它作为一个离线的、概念验证的“二进制动作模型”运行，仅分析图像并触发离散命令，而未与无人机的位姿、速度控制直接耦合。\n   - **影响**：这限制了系统的自主性和适应性。真正的“语言-动作”映射未能实现端到端的连续控制（如5自由度控制），系统实质上是**语义理解（VLA）与底层运动控制（视觉伺服、A*规划）的松耦合**。\n\n### 2. **动作空间极其简单，功能受限**\n   - **动作定义**：VLA模型的输出动作空间仅为二元选择：`{Open, Close}`。论文中明确提到，空间定位和接近轨迹由独立的人体中心控制器处理。\n   - **影响**：这大大限制了系统的操作能力。它无法执行复杂的操纵任务，例如调整抓取姿态、施加力控、或在抓取过程中进行精细的位姿调整。系统更像是一个“到达即抓取”的触发机制，而非一个通用的空中操纵器。\n\n### 3. **系统在动态和不确定性环境中的鲁棒性未经充分验证**\n   - **实验环境**：所有实验均在受控的室内实验室进行，配备了Vicon动捕系统提供地面真值，环境相对静态且结构化。\n   - **未解决问题**：\n     - **抗干扰能力**：论文提到了无人机近地飞行时的下洗流干扰问题，但系统对此的主动补偿能力未在复杂气流或动态障碍物场景下测试。\n     - **感知不确定性处理**：当Grounding DINO检测失败、深度信息噪声大或人体姿态估计（MediaPipe）出现遮挡时，系统的恢复和容错机制仅简要提及，未深入评估。\n     - **实时性挑战**：部分计算密集型模块（如Grounding DINO、VLA推理）在**地面站运行**，依赖Wi-Fi通信。这在高动态任务中可能引入延迟和可靠性问题。\n\n### 4. **安全性与“黑箱”风险的折中**\n   - **设计选择**：论文特意**将高层语义推理（VLA）与底层运动控制（确定性算法）解耦**，以避免端到端VLA模型（如RaceVLA）可能因“幻觉”直接输出危险控制命令的风险。\n   - **带来的新局限**：这种设计虽然提高了安全性，但也**牺牲了灵活性和智能性**。系统无法像端到端模型那样学习复杂、自适应的人类类似行为。它本质上是一个**基于规则的框架**，VLA仅充当了一个高级触发器。\n\n### 5. **人机交互的深度不足**\n   - **当前交互**：交互主要是单向的（人类发出语言指令，无人机执行取物和交付）。交付阶段基于固定规则（如距离0.6-0.8米，胸部高度）。\n   - **缺乏**：双向沟通、对用户意图的深层理解（如模糊指令处理）、自适应交付策略（如根据用户手势或语音反馈调整）以及情感化或社交化的交互元素。\n\n---\n\n## 未来可能的改进方向\n\n基于上述局限性，论文在结论部分也展望了未来工作，综合来看改进方向包括：\n\n### 1. **实现闭环、实时的端到端VLA控制**\n   - **目标**：将验证过的VLA概念**集成到真实的飞行控制回路中**，实现从感知到连续动作的端到端映射。\n   - **具体路径**：利用当前系统作为**数据收集管道**，记录飞行中的视觉输入和对应的成功动作序列，构建一个专门的数据集，用于训练一个能够输出**完整5自由度控制指令（x, y, z, 偏航角速度，夹爪状态）** 的定制化VLA模型。\n\n### 2. **扩展系统能力与通用性**\n   - **复杂操作**：开发能够执行**力控交互**（如推门、拧阀门）、**非抓取操作**（如按压、擦拭）的VLA模型和硬件。\n   - **多任务与场景**：从简单的“取-递”扩展到**多步骤任务**（如“把桌上的螺丝刀放进工具箱”）、**动态环境**（移动的物体或人）以及**室外或非结构化工业环境**。\n\n### 3. **增强系统的鲁棒性与安全性**\n   - **抗干扰控制**：设计更先进的控制器， explicitly 补偿下洗流和负载变化动力学。\n   - **感知冗余与融合**：融合多传感器信息（如IMU、激光雷达）以提高定位和检测在光照变化、遮挡情况下的鲁棒性。\n   - **安全框架**：开发形式化验证的安全层或保护性控制策略，即使在高层级VLA指令出错时，也能确保无人机遵守物理约束和安全规则。\n\n### 4. **深化人机交互与协作**\n   - **自然交互**：结合**语音识别与合成**，实现更自然的双向对话。利用VLA理解更抽象或上下文相关的指令。\n   - **自适应交付**：研究人类行为预测，实现更流畅、个性化的物品交付（如根据用户伸手动作动态调整交付点和时机）。\n   - **协作任务**：探索多无人机或人机团队协作完成复杂装配或检查任务。\n\n### 5. **面向特定领域的专业化**\n   - **工业VLA**：如论文所述，开发针对**复杂室内导航和操纵任务**（如仓库库存管理、设备巡检维修）的专用VLA模型，提升在特定领域的效率和可靠性。\n\n**总结**：DroneVLA是一项重要的概念验证工作，为VLA在空中操纵领域的应用奠定了基础。其未来的演进将从**开环验证走向闭环控制**，从**简单二元动作走向连续多维操作**，从**受控实验室走向复杂现实世界**，最终目标是实现安全、鲁棒、智能且能与人类自然协作的“具身空中智能体”。",
