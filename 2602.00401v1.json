A robot with a similar form can, in principle, operate within these environments without requiring extensive modifications, working alongside people to perform the same everyday tasks. However, to function effectively in such settings, it must first be capable of executing the kinds of motions that humans can perform. In this context, success is measured less by proficiency in a single, task-specific behavior and more by the generality of performing a broad repertoire of coordinated, whole-body movements and skills with human-like fluidity. However, realizing human-level physical intelligence on humanoids presents significant challenges: their high degrees of freedom, intermittent and multi-contact interactions, and inevitable modeling mismatches demand control strategies that can capture the richness of human movement while withstanding real-world uncertainty.\nHere, we address this grand challenge with\nZEST\n(Zero-shot Embodied Skill Transfer), a unified framework for learning physical intelligence.\nZEST\ntranslates the diversity and expressiveness of human motion from heterogeneous data sources into a robust control policy. This approach enables a legged robot to execute a vast spectrum of skills zero-shot, without any per-task fine-tuning, circumventing the need for complex behavior discovery from scratch by leveraging human motion datasets as a source of general-purpose skills.\nOver the past decade, a popular approach for enabling diverse behaviors on legged robots has been to generate whole-body motion trajectories offline and then track them with a model-based controller. A prime example is Boston Dynamics’ Atlas humanoid, which has demonstrated impressive parkour and dance routines by leveraging references derived from keyframe animation. These motions are executed using a two-layer control architecture composed of a Model Predictive Control (MPC) online planner and an optimization-based whole-body controller\n[\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n,\n4\n,\n5\n]\n.\nThe research community has widely adopted the same model-based\nplan offline, track online\nparadigm across a broad range of tasks for legged platforms. This includes humanoid robots using handrails to climb stairs\n[\n6\n]\n, quadrupeds showing acrobatic behaviors\n[\n7\n]\n, retargeting motions from animals to robots with different morphologies\n[\n8\n]\n, and quadrupedal mobile manipulators tackling multi-contact tasks\n[\n9\n]\n.\nAcross these efforts, the core principle remains the same: use offline trajectory optimization—often in a multi-contact setting—to discover nontrivial, dynamically feasible behaviors that are difficult to design manually, and track these motions online with a general-purpose stabilizing controller.\nThis approach offers versatility and interpretability as a well-tuned controller can track a wide range of physically consistent motions without requiring skill-specific adjustments.\nHowever, the resulting controllers tend to have stronger requirements on environment modeling, estimation, and reference fidelity, making them more difficult to deploy in scenarios involving high uncertainty or complex contact.\nRecently, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful approach for control synthesis, providing exceptional agility and robustness. By learning to manage complex contact dynamics implicitly, RL policies can determine when and where to make contact in real-time, eliminating the need for predefined contact schedules and simplifying control design. Moreover, the ability to train at scale in high-fidelity simulators and transfer policies to hardware zero-shot\n[\n10\n,\n11\n]\nhas accelerated progress in data-driven control\n[\n12\n,\n13\n]\n. This success has led to state-of-the-art performance in legged locomotion, including robust navigation over challenging terrains in the wild\n[\n14\n,\n15\n,\n16\n]\n, high-speed running\n[\n17\n,\n18\n]\n, and extreme parkour\n[\n19\n,\n20\n,\n21\n]\n.\nBeyond locomotion, RL has also proven effective for dexterous manipulation tasks\n[\n22\n,\n23\n,\n24\n]\n, and whole-body mobile manipulation\n[\n25\n,\n26\n,\n27\n,\n28\n]\n. For instance, it has enabled various applications in whole-body mobile manipulation, such as a quadruped to play badminton\n[\n25\n]\n, a humanoid robot to perform forceful tasks such as carrying heavy loads, pulling carts, and opening spring-loaded doors\n[\n26\n]\n, and a quadrupedal manipulator to dynamically push and reorient large boxes\n[\n27\n]\n. Nonetheless, these\ntabula rasa\nRL techniques remain sample-inefficient and highly sensitive to reward design; without careful shaping and regularization, learned policies can exploit the reward structure and exhibit unnatural or overly aggressive behaviors.\nTo mitigate the limitations of\ntabula rasa\nRL, an effective strategy, pioneered in computer graphics, is to use motion data as a prior to regularize policy learning. This data-guided recipe guides controllers toward natural movements, reducing the need for extensive reward engineering. A seminal example is\nDeepMimic\n[\n29\n]\n, which trained polices to imitate a collection of Motion Capture (MoCap) clips while relying on a single, consistent reward structure. This approach was later extended to enable user-steerable control with a motion matcher\n[\n30\n]\n, achieve higher-fidelity tracking of complex motions\n[\n31\n]\n, and scale imitation to massive motion libraries\n[\n32\n]\n.\nAdversarial imitation learning replaces direct imitation rewards with those inferred indirectly by matching the distribution of demonstrations. In Adversarial Motion Priors\n[\n33\n]\n, a discriminator trained to differentiate between state transitions from the dataset and those from policy rollouts provides a style reward that encourages natural motions. Subsequent variants introduce hierarchical or latent-skill formulations to mitigate mode collapse and improve reusability and steerability\n[\n34\n,\n35\n]\n.\nMore recent work closes the loop by coupling kinematic motion generators with physics-based controllers. For instance, text-driven diffusion models now generate plans for multi-task sequences\n[\n36\n]\n, while other hierarchical approaches tackle agile terrain traversal by iteratively augmenting motion datasets\n[\n37\n]\n. This paradigm has also been extended to complex human-object interactions through methods like multi-teacher policy distillation\n[\n38\n]\n.\nThese works from computer graphics highlight a key theme: data—whether as explicit reference clips, adversarial priors, or learned skill embeddings—acts as a powerful regularizer that simplifies reward design, improves motion quality, and scales controllers to broad behavior repertoires.\nFigure 1\n:\nHardware deployment of\nZEST\nacross diverse data sources and robot morphologies.\nIn order of appearance from top left to bottom right, the figure illustrates the following behaviors. From MoCap: Crawl on all fours (Atlas), roll on all fours (Atlas), jog (Atlas), breakdance (Atlas), forward roll (Atlas), cartwheel (G1), table-tennis (G1), cartwheel (atlas), army crawl (Atlas). From ViCap: Dance snippet A (Atlas), jump onto box (G1), climb up/down box (G1), ballet (G1), dance snippet C, soccer kick (Atlas). From Animation: handstand invert (Atlas), handstand balance (Spot), continuous backflip (Spot), barrel roll (Spot).\nDespite strong results in simulation, deploying a unified tracking policy on hardware remains nontrivial. The sim-to-real gap—stemming from inevitable modeling discrepancies—is worsened by contact-rich behaviors and operations near the robot’s actuation limits: many dynamic or acrobatic motions become infeasible once real torque, speed, and safety constraints are enforced. In contrast, such limits are often ignored in computer graphics settings, allowing for aggressive exploration during training, which in turn facilitates learning. Policies must also operate under partial observability (e.g., missing global pose or root linear velocity), typically requiring either a state-estimation stack or a history-conditioned policy, both of which add complexity during training and deployment.\nNevertheless, a growing body of work has begun to bridge this gap by leveraging real-to-sim strategies and various data sources. In\n[\n39\n]\n, Peng et al. enable quadruped robots to perform diverse gaits by imitating real animal MoCap data. Grandia et al.\n[\n40\n]\npresent an RL-based policy that executes expressive, real-time stage performances driven by animation engines.\nVideoMimic\n[\n41\n]\nutilizes everyday videos to train a whole-body policy to execute contextual skills through a real-to-sim-to-real pipeline.\nASAP\n[\n42\n]\nlearns to perform agile whole-body skills by pre-training motion-tracking policies from human videos, collecting trajectories on hardware, and learning a “delta-action” model that reduces the sim-to-real gap.\nKungfuBot\n[\n43\n]\ntrains a policy for Unitree G1 to perform dynamic motions, such as acrobatic dance and kung-fu strikes, through multi-step motion processing (filtering, correction, retargeting with physical constraints).\nHuB\n[\n44\n]\npushed the limits of the same hardware to achieve extreme balance in challenging one-legged stance tasks.\nUsing reference trajectories from model-based planners is another strategy for imitation-based RL.\nMethods like\nOpt-Mimic\n[\n45\n]\nand\nDTC\n[\n46\n]\nexemplify this approach by training policies to mimic optimized plans, thereby combining the precision of trajectory optimization with the robustness of an RL tracking controller.\nSimilarly, a two-stage RL framework can leverage a single optimal trajectory as initial guidance and then fine-tune purely for task completion, yielding robust locomotion policies\n[\n47\n]\n.\nFor multi-contact loco-manipulation, Sleiman et al.\n[\n48\n]\nutilize a single offline demonstration to train policies for tasks like traversing spring-loaded doors and manipulating heavy dishwashers. The resulting policy generalizes beyond the reference, learning to handle object variability and discover novel recovery maneuvers.\nAnother line of work focuses on human-driven and generalist control, grounded in large-scale motion tracking and teacher–student distillation.\nOmniH2O\n[\n49\n]\ntreats kinematic pose as a universal control interface and learns an autonomous whole-body policy by imitating a privileged teacher trained on large-scale retargeted/augmented datasets.\nHOVER\n[\n50\n]\ndistills a motion imitation teacher into a student policy while applying proprioception and command masking with mode-specific and sparsity-based masks, resulting in a unified multi-mode command space for a whole-body tracking policy. Most recently,\nGMT\n[\n51\n]\ncombines an adaptive sampling strategy (biasing sampling towards harder-to-learn motions) with a Mixture-of-Experts teacher that enhances expressiveness and generalizability. Student policies distilled from this teacher track a broad spectrum of motions achieving state-of-the-art real-world performance.\nDespite these advancements, a significant obstacle to scalability and robustness persists: the dependence on intricate or multi-stage pipelines that are often composed of handcrafted components. These complexities can include auxiliary shaping reward terms, contact labeling, multi-stage training, access to non-proprioceptive signals or to histories of proprioception, and per-behavior retuning.\nIn this work, we present\nZEST\n, a unified, generic, and minimal recipe that trains policies in a single stage from heterogeneous motion data sources, including MoCap, Video-Captured (ViCap) motions, and keyframe animations. By design, this approach eliminates complex, domain-specific techniques such as contact labeling, extensive reward shaping, future-reference windows, observation histories, and state estimators, while avoiding multi-stage training pipelines. The resulting policy, implemented with a simple feedforward network, robustly tracks diverse motion references using a single set of hyperparameters for each robot and deploys zero-shot to hardware.\nWe apply\nZEST\nto Boston Dynamics’ electrically-actuated Atlas humanoid robot (approximately 1.8 m and 100 kg, comparable to an average adult human). The exact formulation and training recipe are applicable across robots with different sizes, weights, and embodiments, from the full-scale Atlas humanoid to the smaller Unitree G1 humanoid and the Spot quadruped. This versatility demonstrates a level of generality that represents a significant advance over specialized controllers tightly coupled to a single robot or behavior.\nConcurrent work reports closely related motion-imitation pipelines and transfer results on the G1 platform\n[\n52\n,\n53\n,\n54\n]\n. In this work, we evaluate a single, unified framework with a systematic, low-tuning training recipe across multiple robot platforms and multiple reference sources. This evaluation yields, to our knowledge, the first dynamic, multi-contact behaviors (e.g., army crawl, breakdance) on a full-size humanoid (Atlas) and the first video-to-behavior transfer of agile, contact-rich skills, such as box-climbing and dancing, to a physical humanoid (Unitree G1). Related work on ViCap-based sim-to-real transfer such as\nVideoMimic\n[\n41\n]\nprimarily focuses on locomotion-style behaviors, whereas our video-derived demonstrations emphasize complex dynamic multi-contact skills with intermittent whole-body contact events and sustained whole-body contact interactions.\nOur policies utilize the next-step reference and current proprioceptive signals as observations, with only the previous action as the history. They output residual joint targets, which are then added to the reference and sent to a joint-level PD (Proportional-Derivative) controller.\nTo ground our simulation in reality, the PD gains are tuned using effective motor armature values derived from an analytical model that approximates closed-chain kinematics in actuators such as knees and ankles. For Spot, we incorporated more accurate models of its power system and actuators in simulation.\nTo handle long-horizon clips and scale beyond single skills, trajectories are split into fixed-duration bins, with difficulty level estimated via an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of failure scores. A categorical sampler biases toward harder bins, facilitating long-horizon and multi-trajectory learning without catastrophic forgetting.\nTo help stabilize training and avoid long convergence times for highly dynamic behaviors—especially those involving large base rotations—a virtual assistive wrench is computed in a model-based fashion and applied directly to the robot’s base. Its magnitude is adapted based on the per-bin difficulty levels and eventually decays to zero as tracking performance improves, eliminating the need for a handcrafted curriculum. Training is performed entirely in simulation with moderate domain randomization (e.g., impulsive pushes, sensor noise, and variations in friction coefficients and masses).\nThe result of this framework is a pipeline that demonstrates remarkable robustness from data to deployment. It effectively processes reference motions from diverse sources, successfully handling high-fidelity MoCap data, noisy ViCap data with artifacts like pose jitter and foot-skidding, and kinematically clean but often physically infeasible animation data. The framework’s ability to retarget motions from all three sources highlights its resilience to a wide range of data imperfections. This entire training process results in policies that are deployed to the hardware zero-shot via an automated pipeline.\nFigure 2\n:\nSummary of the\nZEST\nframework and its hardware results.\nRESULTS\nMovie 1 summarizes the methodology and results of the presented work. In this section, we outline our evaluation procedure and present our empirical findings. Unless otherwise indicated, all presented results are obtained on hardware. Each experiment uses a specialized policy trained solely on the target skill. This specialization avoids the extended training required for a purely multi-skill model to sample the target reference as often as in the single-skill setting and, in practice, delivers stronger and more consistent tracking performance within a fixed time budget. Therefore, we do not deploy a multi-skill policy on hardware, but only use it to perform simulation-based analyses. Each policy was trained for approximately 10 hours (about 7k iterations) on a single NVIDIA L4 GPU and validated across multiple independent hardware trials with consistent success. Evaluations span multiple embodiments—Boston Dynamics’ electrically actuated Atlas humanoid, Unitree’s G1 humanoid, and Boston Dynamics’ Spot quadruped—and are organized by reference source: MoCap, ViCap, and keyframe animation. Figure\n1\nshows representative frame snapshots across all skills, per-skill clips are provided in Movie 1, and the corresponding reference motions are included in Movies S1–S3. Table\n1\nlists all motions, and for each, marks whether it involves multiple body contacts with the ground (i.e., apart from the robot’s feet), and reports tracking metrics for joint angles, base orientation, and base angular velocity. The base orientation is represented by its roll and pitch components. We exclude yaw, as it is not directly observable from the on-board IMU and is subject to significant drift. Next, we evaluate a multi-skill policy in simulation and use it to justify our key design choices via simulation-based ablation studies. Finally, we include a simulation-based comparison with a state-of-the-art whole-body MPC baseline developed at Boston Dynamics.\nMoCap-Derived Human-Like Skills on Hardware\nMoCap references enable a broad range of behaviors on Atlas (Table\n1\n; Movie S1). As shown in Movie S1, we deploy\nwalk\n,\njog\n,\nforward roll\n,\nroll on all fours\n,\ncrawl on all fours\n,\narmy crawl\n,\ncartwheel\n, and a short\nbreakdance\non hardware, and we also evaluate a MoCap\ntable-tennis\nand a\ncartwheel\nmotion on Unitree’s G1 using the same formulation (with actuator parameters adapted to that platform).\nWe highlight salient aspects of these MoCap-driven behaviors. For\nwalk\nand\njog\n, foot–ground interactions are straightforward, yet several natural-gait hallmarks emerge: a clear heel–toe rollover rather than flat-foot placement; near full-knee extension despite proximity to joint limits; and graceful, quiet transitions—both within gait cycles and when decelerating from a fast jog to stance—without stomping, chatter, or audible impacts. These features are extremely challenging to induce through pure reward shaping alone. We attribute their emergence to high-fidelity MoCap references that preserve human nuance, actuator models tuned to be responsive without excessive stiffness, and regularization that discourages impulsive transients.\nThe same formulation also accommodates complex multi-contact behaviors without prescribing contact schedules or constraining base height or orientation to upright configurations. All motions begin from a standing configuration and return to standing at completion.\nForward roll\nthrows the body forward from stance, makes initial forearm contact, and completes a full forward roll with back contact.\nRoll on all fours\nand\ncrawl on all fours\nemploy intermittent heel–toe, knee, and wrist contacts; the former executes a lateral roll, while the latter advances forward under low ground clearance.\nArmy crawl\nmaintains near-continuous arm–leg–torso contact with deliberate sliding to translate forward.\nCartwheel\nalternates hand–foot supports and passes through transient hand-supported inversions that require accurate hand placement and high angular-rate control. The most challenging case is the\nbreakdance\nsequence, which combines extended body–ground contact phases with rapid leg sweeps and includes segments operated near joint limits where a leg—with its knee fully extended—threads beneath the opposite leg, inducing unavoidable self-contact.\nTable 1\n:\nEvaluation across motions, grouped by reference source.\nA skill is labeled as\nmulti-contact\nif any body part other than the feet interacts with the ground.

For model-based frameworks, the intricacy of modeling contact phenomena—high-impulse events, stick–slip transitions, and extended body–ground interactions over complex geometries—poses a major obstacle to designing stabilizing controllers for multi-contact behaviors. Accordingly, these methods typically predefine the active end-effectors and avoid motions with whole-body contacts. Even for RL policies trained in simulation, these regimes magnify the sim-to-real gap, as small mismatches in contact, friction, compliance, and geometry compound over extended contact-rich phases. Consistent with Table\n1\n, simpler foot-only gaits (\nwalk\n,\njog\n) exhibit lower tracking errors across\nMAE\n​\n(\n𝒒\n)\n\\mathrm{MAE}(\\bm{q})\nand\nMAD\n​\n(\nR\n)\n\\mathrm{MAD}(R)\n, whereas more dynamic, multi-contact skills (\nforward roll\n,\nroll on all fours\n,\ncrawl on all fours\n,\narmy crawl\n,\ncartwheel\n,\nbreakdance\n) show higher orientation and angular-velocity discrepancies.\nFinally, we also imitate a\ncartwheel\nmotion and a\ntable-tennis\non Unitree’s G1. While our G1 evaluations are predominantly ViCap-derived motions (next section), this result provides an additional check of humanoid-to-humanoid cross-morphology transfer while holding the formulation constant across varying data sources. The G1’s\nCartwheel\nreference, although approximately 2s longer than the version for Atlas, demonstrates a comparable motion quality. However, it has a higher orientation error, which we attribute to differences in the quality of the IMUs between the two platforms. Another challenging long-horizon task is the\ntable-tennis\n, which requires coordinating upper-body swings with dynamic base maneuvers. Its extended duration makes it difficult to learn, and our adaptive sampling strategy was crucial in achieving a successful outcome for this behavior.\nViCap-Derived Human-Like Skills on Hardware\nOur experiments with ViCap references highlight robustness to noisy, video-reconstructed motions while maintaining fluid, temporally coherent motion over long sequences (Movie S2). We employ video demonstrations captured in the wild with a handheld phone camera, yielding a fast and practical data generation pipeline:\nrecord\n→\n\\rightarrow\nreconstruct\n→\n\\rightarrow\nretarget\n→\n\\rightarrow\ntrain\n→\n\\rightarrow\nexecute\n, where\nreconstruct\ndenotes 3D pose estimation with temporal smoothing. Converting a recorded video into a retargeted reference motion takes minutes, so in practice, we can capture a new clip in the morning, train during the day, and run it on hardware that evening.\nOn Atlas, we execute a\nsoccer kick\nmotion and three\ndance\nsnippets (A–C). These sequences include extended single-foot support phases and multiple consecutive hops, requiring sustained balance with precise foot placement and timing. Despite visible artifacts in the references (pose jitter and foot skidding; Movie S2), we still achieve zero-shot sim-to-real transfer while preserving expressivity, without heavy motion post-processing (e.g., physics-aware trajectory optimization for high-fidelity dynamic retargeting); as reported in Table\n1\n, tracking errors remain surprisingly low (e.g.,\nMAE\n​\n(\n𝒒\n)\n\\mathrm{MAE}(\\bm{q})\nand\nMAD\n​\n(\nR\n)\n\\mathrm{MAD}(R)\nnear\n0.05\n0.05\nrad). We attribute this to a reward formulation that does not force tight adherence to the reference root trajectory: the policy is encouraged to track the global motion in a relaxed fashion, rejecting obvious artifacts while still solving the task. Moreover, our MDP and rewards do not require contact labels, so the policy is agnostic to noisy contact timings/schedules extracted from the ViCap reference.\nWe further demonstrate cross-embodiment transfer on Unitree’s G1 with an athletic\nballet sequence\nfeaturing a sustained aerial phase with both legs abducted in mid-air and extended single-foot support near the edge of stability, stressing balance, orientation regulation, and precise foot placement. We also evaluate scene-interactive\nbox\nskills on G1:\njump onto box\n,\nclimb up box\n, and\nclimb down box\n. These experiments involve whole-body contacts and push the system near its operational limits.\nInstead of providing the policy with the box’s precise location through perception or MoCap, we test its ability to execute these skills robustly using a minimalist, proprioceptive-only interface. To achieve this, we train the policy with slight randomizations in the initial relative pose between the robot and the box. At test time, the policy reliably handles this variability without additional sensing.\nFurthermore, these scene-interactive skills reflect a combination of challenges, including (i) compounded modeling mismatches arising from multi-contact interactions, (ii) discrepancies between the simulated box and the physical platform (notably compliance and friction), (iii) lack of box–robot relative-positioning feedback, and (iv) artifacts in the reconstructed references. Despite these factors, hardware executions are completed reliably, and the characteristic style of the source motions remains evident. As highlighted in Table\n1\n, errors remain reasonable overall and are comparable to those observed for the more challenging behaviors presented in the MoCap section. To further characterize repeatability and robustness on these challenging behaviors, we conduct additional variability testing. In Movie S6, we execute box climb up and box climb down five times consecutively, achieving five out of five successful runs under conditions kept as close as possible to the nominal training setup (i.e., the box height set to its nominal value of 0.75 m and the robot initialized near the nominal pose with respect to the box). In Movie S7, we stress-test the policy’s robustness by varying the initial robot–box relative pose around the nominal configuration. Since these policies are inherently invariant to lateral offsets relative to the box center, we randomize the robot’s initial offset in\nx\nx\nand yaw while keeping\ny\ny\nclose to the nominal value. All trials initialized within the training distribution succeed (\n±\n10\n\\pm 10\ncm in\nx\nx\nand\n±\n0.3\n\\pm 0.3\nrad in yaw), as highlighted in Figure S5. Beyond this range, we observe occasional successes, while failures occur for initial states outside the training distribution. We additionally test robustness to mass variability by attaching a 2 kg payload to the torso and still obtain successful executions for both box climb up and box climb down. Finally, we vary the box height beyond the randomized training range. Although training uses a nominal height of 0.75 m with randomization over\n[\n0.70\n,\n0.80\n]\n[0.70,0.80]\nm, box climb up executes successfully at 0.55 m, while box climb down succeeds at both 0.55 m and 0.95 m.\nKeyframe-Animated Skills for Humanoids and Quadrupeds on Hardware\nKeyframe animation broadens our motion library beyond natural human movement. For humanoids such as Atlas, it enables us to exploit robot-specific degrees of freedom not represented in human motion capture, such as continuous joints in the arms, legs, or spine. These joints enable configurations that human anatomy cannot achieve. For instance, we achieve a\nhandstand invert\nmotion by rotating the robot’s back–yaw joint while maintaining stable hand support (Movie S3).\nKeyframe animation is equally important for platforms that lack a human form, where collecting human-like demonstrations is inherently difficult. To assess generality under a larger morphology gap, we apply the same framework on Boston Dynamics’ Spot, where we demonstrate a\nhandstand balance\n(forelegs), a\ncontinuous backflip\n, a\nbarrel roll\n, and a playful\nhappy dog\nmotion.\nAlthough animation references are kinematically clean and temporally coherent, several sequences are dynamically aggressive or partially infeasible for the physical system. In these cases, the learned policy intentionally relaxes adherence to the reference—especially for base orientation and angular-rate profiles—to remain feasible, which increases reported means while preserving overall execution quality. This pattern is visible in Table\n1\nwhen contrasting\nMAE\n​\n(\n𝒒\n)\n\\mathrm{MAE}(\\bm{q})\nand\nMAD\n​\n(\nR\n)\n\\mathrm{MAD}(R)\nwith the corresponding maxima: for Atlas\nhandstand invert\n, the means are moderate while\nmax\n⁡\n(\n𝒒\n)\n\\max(\\bm{q})\nand\nmax\n⁡\n(\nR\n)\n\\max(R)\nspike during transient inversions; on Spot,\nbackflip\nand\nbarrel roll\nshow larger orientation and angular-velocity errors (see\nMAD\n​\n(\nR\n)\n\\mathrm{MAD}(R)\nand\nML2\n​\n(\n𝝎\n)\n\\mathrm{ML2}(\\bm{\\omega})\n) and high maxima, reflecting brief deviations from the reference for the sake of feasibility and stability.\nNotably, the policy’s robustness is highlighted on the Spot robot for the\nbarrel roll\nmotion, where it completes the motion even after the on-board IMU sensor saturates mid-maneuver.\n(a)\nWrench scaling.\n(b)\nFailure levels.\n(c)\nTrajectory-bin counts.\n(d)\nSampling probabilities.\n(e)\nAblation after 10 h training (\n≈\n\\approx\n7k iterations).\n(f)\nAblation after 20 h training (\n≈\n\\approx\n14k iterations).\nFigure 3\n:\nSimulation-based evaluation and ablation studies.\n(\na\n–\nd\n) A mid-training snapshot of the signals driving our adaptive curriculum: (\na\n) assistive wrench scaling, which is modulated by failure, (\nb\n) per-bin failure levels, (\nc\n) bin visitation counts, and (\nd\n) sampling probabilities. Higher failure rates increase the sampling probability, and over time, visitation counts rise where failures are frequent.\n(\ne\n–\nf\n) Success rates for the baseline and ablations after 10 h and 20 h of training under complete domain randomization. Bars show mean success; whiskers show min–max; internal lines mark median; dots denote p10; numbers under lower whiskers report the minimum. The plots show that the assistive curriculum and adaptive sampling are critical for performance and sample efficiency. Removing privileged information from the critic or using absolute actions significantly degrades robustness, while adding observation/reference windows hinders learning.\nSimulation-Based Evaluation and Ablation Studies\nWe train a single multi-skill policy for Atlas over 15 motions with diverse lengths and difficulties drawn from MoCap, ViCap, and keyframe animations, ranging from simple gaits (walking, squatting) to multi-contact and acrobatic sequences (army crawl, breakdancing, cartwheel-to-backflip). To inspect how the method operates during learning, Figure\n3\n(a–d) shows a representative mid-training snapshot of our adaptive sampling signals: failure levels per trajectory bin, the resulting sampling probabilities, the number of times each bin has been visited, and the assistive-wrench scaling applied when starting from that segment. Higher failure rates increase sampling probability and, over time, visitation counts rise where failures are frequent. The easiest bin is the animated squat (trajectory index 8), while the cartwheel-to-backflip sequence (trajectory index 13) is the hardest; the sampler thus allocates more training to the latter and less to the former, while modulating the assistive wrench accordingly.\nEvaluation proceeds by initializing each episode at the start of a randomly sampled reference trajectory and rolling it to completion. For each reference, we run 10000 rollouts under full domain randomization, sampling external pushes, observation noise, robot link masses, friction coefficients, and perturbations of the initial state. We quantify performance and robustness via ablations presented in Figure\n3\n(e–f), which report success rates after 10 h (\n≈\n\\approx\n7k iterations) and 20 h (\n≈\n\\approx\n14k iterations) of training. At 10 h, our method achieves the highest mean success and markedly better lower-tail performance across behaviors. By 20 h, several ablations narrow the mean gap, yet the baseline remains more robust, with higher p10 and minimum success values that lie closer to the mean.\nWe ablate, one at a time, curriculum, adaptive sampling, reference and observation windows, action space, and actor–critic observation design. Removing curriculum still converges, but its 20 h performance roughly matches our method at 10 h, indicating that a minimal variant without curriculum is feasible but less sample-efficient, particularly on motions with large base-orientation variability (e.g., trajectory index 13). Removing adaptive sampling decreases performance because the policy undersamples hard bins. The heatmaps support this mechanism, as sampling probabilities track failure levels and concentrate updates where failure is high, which the ablation cannot reproduce.\nTo better contextualize the ablations over the wrench-assist curriculum and the adaptive sampling strategy, we summarize the roles played by each component. The assistive wrench primarily serves as an exploration and stabilization aid for highly dynamic motions (e.g., the cartwheel-to-backflip sequence) that frequently terminate early in training; in these regimes, it reduces catastrophic failures, stabilizes learning, and typically improves sample efficiency when reset-based exploration (i.e., Reference State Initialization) alone is insufficient. For simpler motions with fewer early failures, we find the wrench can often be reduced or removed with limited impact. Adaptive sampling is most beneficial when training on long-horizon trajectories or large motion libraries, and when the goal is to track each phase of each motion well rather than optimizing average performance. Without adaptive sampling, training can under-emphasize rare or difficult trajectory segments, leading to persistent weaknesses on those segments and degraded lower-tail performance.\nUsing longer reference or observation windows—either 20 steps of history or 20 steps of future references (0.4 s each)—increases input dimensionality and redundancy, complicates credit assignment, and slows or prevents convergence under the same budget. This negative result may be specific to our hyperparameters and architecture; sequence-to-sequence models or different tuning could yield different conclusions, but we did not pursue such changes to keep the setup minimal and focused. We provide a finer-grained sweep over future-reference horizons and observation-history lengths (5, 10, 15, and 20 steps) in the Supplementary Materials (Figure S3), which reveals a gradual degradation in performance as the window length increases.\nMatching actor and critic inputs by stripping privileged observations from the critic degrades value estimation. The critic benefits from privileged signals such as the full root state, contact forces, key-body positions, and the assistive-wrench signal, which reflects curriculum-induced dynamics. Without these, value estimates become noisier, leading to weaker policy updates. Finally, absolute actions (as opposed to residual actions) yield the worst performance. Because episodes are initialized on the reference throughout training, small policy outputs—which typically occur during early stages of training—can induce large PD tracking errors and hence large joint torques, destabilizing rollouts. In addition, absolute actions impose a larger exploration burden: the policy must synthesize the full joint commands, whereas residual actions leverage the feedforward reference and learn only the required offsets, leading to faster and more stable learning.\nAdditional details on the reference motions used for ablation are provided in the Supplementary Materials (Table S1), along with a video showcasing evaluation rollouts from the multi-skill policy (Movie S4). We further report simulation-based robustness sweeps across domain-randomization factors in the Supplementary Materials (Figure S4).\nTable 2\n:\nSimulation-based comparison of MPC vs. a multi-skill RL policy.\nThe RL policy is trained on all Atlas motions in Table\n1\n, but evaluations are performed over a subset of these motions.

Evaluations use a subset of motions drawn from all three reference sources (MoCap, ViCap, and animation). For MPC, we extract contact schedules from each reference using a simple heuristic that considers the distance between the foot and the ground, as well as the foot’s velocity. This heuristic is relatively straightforward for animated sequences (e.g.,\nhandstand invert\n), but it becomes more error-prone for MoCap and particularly ViCap motions, where unrealistic foot sliding and noisy contact timings lead to mislabelled contacts and necessitate careful manual tuning. The MPC stack natively supports interaction with feet and hands, but not contacts beyond those end-effectors. As a result, motions that involve knee, torso, or forearm contacts (e.g.,\narmy crawl\n,\nforward roll\n,\ncrawl on all fours\n) fall outside its default capability and were excluded from the MPC comparison. In contrast, the learned policy does not require explicit contact labeling, is more tolerant of model mismatch and contact-timing errors, and readily accommodates interactions with arbitrary body parts.\nFor a quantitative comparison, Table\n2\nreports\nMAE\n​\n(\n𝒒\n)\n\\mathrm{MAE}(\\bm{q})\nand\nMAD\n​\n(\nR\n)\n\\mathrm{MAD}(R)\nfor MPC and RL.\nEmpirically, for\nwalk\n, MPC and RL perform nearly the same: the contact schedule is clean and easy to label, and the trajectory never pushes the robot beyond its operational bounds, which suits MPC. On the other hand, RL outperforms MPC on the more dynamic behaviors, namely\ncartwheel\nand\njog\n. In particular, for\njog\n, we observe MPC degradation tied to inconsistent contact annotation at the start of the reference despite extensive manual refinements. Several sequences fail under MPC (reported as “–” in the MPC columns):\ndance B\n(inaccurate contact sequence and sliding),\nhandstand invert\n(controller saturation on arm torque under a point-contact constraint), and\nroll on all fours\n(difficulty regulating extended toe-contact phases without knee collisions). The videos of the references augmented with contact labels, as well as rollouts from MPC and the RL policy, are provided in Movie S5.\nDISCUSSION\nFigure 4\n:\nOverview of\nZEST\n, which consists of three main stages.\n(1) Reference data:\nA diverse set of motions from MoCap, ViCap, and keyframe animation is processed; MoCap/ViCap references are kinematically retargeted to the target robot.\n(2) Training setup and MDP formulation:\nIn simulation, the policy is trained using only on-robot signals and the next target state from the reference, while a separate critic receives privileged information (e.g., true base velocity, contact forces) to accelerate learning. To handle long-horizon clips and scale beyond single skills, an adaptive sampling scheme is proposed: trajectories are segmented into fixed-duration bins; a per-bin difficulty level metric is updated via an EMA of failure scores; and a categorical sampler biases reset-state selection toward harder bins while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of easier behaviors. A model-based virtual assistive wrench is applied at the base to stabilize training for highly dynamic behaviors; the current bin’s difficulty level modulates its magnitude and is automatically annealed to zero as tracking improves.\n(3) Zero-shot deployment:\nThe trained policy is deployed directly to the physical robot without any fine-tuning.\nZEST\nbridges motion datasets and robust whole-body control on legged robots. In doing so, it delivers three core contributions. First, it establishes a generic and streamlined motion-imitation recipe that trains RL policies in a single stage from heterogeneous reference sources with various imperfections (high-fidelity MoCap, noisy ViCap, and non-physics-constrained animation) and deploys it on hardware zero-shot.\nZEST\navoids complexities such as contact labels, reference or observation windows, state-estimators, extensive reward shaping, and multi-stage training. Second, our work achieves a new state of the art in demonstrated hardware capabilities across multiple embodiments. On Atlas, we demonstrate, to our knowledge, the first dynamic multi-contact behaviors on a full-size humanoid. Concurrently, on the Unitree G1, we present the first physical motion transfer of highly dynamic skills, such as dancing and box climbing, directly from video. Third, while focused on Atlas, the same policy structure and training recipe carry over to distinct morphologies such as Boston Dynamics’ Spot and Unitree’s G1. Compared to a state-of-the-art whole-body MPC baseline, which prescribes contacts only at predefined end-effectors, the learned controller eliminates the need for contact schedules and motion-specific costs, is more robust to modeling and contact-timing mismatches, and accommodates interactions with arbitrary body parts (e.g., knees, torso, forearms).\nOn the other hand, several limitations remain and motivate our next steps. First, we do not evaluate the generalization of our multi-skill policy to motions outside the training set – unseen skills that are close to, but not identical with, the training distribution. Such tests would probe whether the policy is able to learn transferable control primitives as opposed to purely overfitting to specific references. We defer this generalization study to future work. Second, the current formulation is proprioceptive and assumes flat and non-slippery terrain; explicit perception of uneven or compliant environments is left for future work. Finally, sim-to-real hinges on reasonable modeling; while we provide a practical procedure involving PLA modeling and a principled selection of armature-dependent PD gains, fully automated system identification remains an open problem. Particularly challenging are complex phenomena that are difficult to capture with first-principles models, and are likely to necessitate data-driven methodologies.\nFurthermore, we outline several directions that extend the scope of this work. First, we will pursue general tracking of previously unseen motions via compact motion embeddings or with zero-/few-shot adaptations, paired with continual-learning strategies to expand libraries without catastrophic forgetting. In parallel, we plan to move beyond full-reference control toward partially conditioned interfaces. One approach is to train a teacher to track a large corpus with full references and then distill the knowledge to a student that accepts sparse, human-interpretable inputs. These inputs could include keyframes, short pose snippets, object and scene keyframes, or language commands, following the masked-conditioning paradigm explored in the literature on physics-based character control\n[\n55\n]\n. Additionally, we will explore high-level generative planners that map user commands to motion plans, which a general-purpose RL-based tracker can execute, thereby closing the loop between behavior synthesis and control, as demonstrated in recent character-control systems\n[\n36\n,\n37\n]\n.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nWe now present the technical details of\nZEST\n. This section details its architecture, as illustrated in Figure\n4\n, with a primary focus on the goal-conditioned MDP formulation. We describe the core components of this framework, including modeling, curation of the reference motion dataset, the training setup, and the policy deployment process on hardware.\nSystems and Modeling\nWe evaluated\nZEST\nusing three robots with different morphologies: the full-scale Boston Dynamics Atlas humanoid (\n30\n30\nDoF,\n1.8\n​\nm\n1.8\\mathrm{m}\n,\n100\n​\nk\n​\ng\n100\\mathrm{kg}\n), the smaller Unitree G1 humanoid (\n29\n29\nDoF,\n1.2\n​\nm\n1.2\\mathrm{m}\n,\n35\n​\nk\n​\ng\n35\\mathrm{kg}\n), and the Boston Dynamics Spot quadruped (\n12\n12\nDoF,\n33\n​\nk\n​\ng\n33\\mathrm{kg}\n). Our RL approach uses the Isaac Lab simulator\n[\n56\n]\n. However, a primary challenge for humanoids is to efficiently model the Parallel-Linkage Actuator (PLA), which is used in ankles, knees, and waists. While a crucial design for dynamic performance, simulating their closed-chain mechanisms results in stiff dynamics that are computationally expensive to calculate. To resolve the trade-off between simulation fidelity and computational efficiency, we developed a series of progressive approximations for the PLAs. A brief overview of these models is provided below, with the approach illustrated in Figure\n5\n. Detailed mathematical derivations are available in the Supplementary Materials (Section S2).\n1.\nLocally Projected Model (Massless-Links Approx.)\n: Our first approximation is motivated by the lightweight design of the PLA’s support links. We assume these links are massless while retaining the inertia of the motor armatures and the main kinematic chain of PLA. This yields a simulator-compatible model where the effective motor armature is configuration-dependent.\n2.\nDynamic Armature Model (Diagonal Approx.)\n: To handle coupled PLAs (e.g., a humanoid’s ankles), which produce non-diagonal armature matrices that standard simulators cannot handle, we use a Jacobi approximation. This method approximates the off-diagonal dynamic effects, introducing only a minor, transient error.\n3.\nNominal Armature Model (Fixed-Configuration Approx.)\n: Finally, to eliminate the computational overhead of updating armatures at every timestep (\n≈\n\\approx\n20% slowdown), we compute the armature values once at a single, nominal configuration and fix them. This provides a computationally cheap model and a principled basis for designing the robot’s PD controller gains.\nWhile the Spot model proposed in\n[\n57\n]\nwas sufficient for generating most behaviors, it proved insufficient for the more dynamic triple backflip behavior. To bridge the sim-to-real gap, we developed a more detailed actuator model that incorporates the robot’s power-limiting algorithm and simulates nonlinear effects, such as motor magnet saturation and torque losses resulting from transmission inefficiencies and friction. Static parameters of the model (e.g., rotor inertia, friction) were obtained from manufacturer specifications. The positive and negative work efficiencies were identified by optimizing the model against real-world data logged from the robot and randomly selected during training within ranges. See Supplementary Materials (Section S3) for derivations.\nFigure 5\n:\nProgressive simplification of proposed Parallel-Linkage Actuator models.\nIt illustrates our modeling approach using a representative humanoid leg, where a motor on the thigh actuates the knee via a four-bar linkage. We begin with\n(1) the Exact Model\n, which fully resolves the closed-loop dynamics. We then introduce a series of progressively simplified models.\n(2) The Locally Projected Model\nassumes massless support links.\n(3) The Dynamic/Nominal Armature Model\nuses a Jacobi approximation for coupled joints, and finally, the most efficient model calculates armature values at a single fixed configuration.\nReference Motion Pipeline\nOur framework learns from a diverse library of reference motions, derived from MoCap, ViCap, and keyframe animation. All human-centric data sourced through MoCap or ViCap is mapped to the target robot’s skeleton through kinematic retargeting. Crucially, we assume no contact labeling for any data source, relying solely on kinematic information. The following subsections provide a brief overview of our data sources and kinematic retargeting pipeline; comprehensive implementation details are deferred to the Supplementary Materials (Section S4).\nData Sources\nMoCap data, captured using Xsens\n[\n58\n]\nand Vicon\n[\n59\n]\nsystems, serves as our highest-fidelity source for natural human movements, requiring only minimal post-processing. To leverage the vast amount of motion available in casual videos, our ViCap pipeline reconstructs 3D human motion from a single camera. This process combines\nMegaSaM\n[\n60\n]\nfor robust camera motion and scene estimation with\nTRAM\n[\n61\n]\nfor human pose estimation, a pairing that we found significantly reduces artifacts, such as pose jitter and foot-skidding. Finally, we use Keyframe Animation to create motions that are not humanly possible or are intended for non-humanoid morphologies, such as the Spot quadruped.\nKinematic Retargeting\nTo transfer MoCap and ViCap data to a target robot, we solve a spacetime optimization\n[\n62\n]\n. The objective function comprises several weighted costs: tracking the root position and orientation of the source motion, aligning corresponding bones via alignment frames, and regularizing the output by penalizing joint velocities. During this process, we also jointly optimize for a uniform scale and time resampling of the source data to ensure any ballistic motions are physically consistent with real-world gravity. The optimization is subject to the robot’s forward kinematics and non-penetration constraints with itself and the ground.\nTraining Setup and MDP Formulation\nWe formulate\nZEST\nas a goal-conditioned MDP,\nℳ\n=\n(\n𝒮\n,\n𝒜\n,\n𝒢\n,\nP\n,\nr\n,\nγ\n)\n\\mathcal{M}=(\\mathcal{S},\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{G},P,r,\\gamma)\n. The state\ns\nt\n∈\n𝒮\ns_{t}\\in\\mathcal{S}\nrepresents the robot and environment states, and\na\nt\n∈\n𝒜\na_{t}\\in\\mathcal{A}\nis the continuous action corresponding to motor action. At time\nt\nt\n, the agent receives the observation,\no\nt\n=\nψ\n​\n(\ns\nt\n,\ng\nt\n)\no_{t}=\\psi(s_{t},g_{t})\nand the target,\ng\nt\n∈\n𝒢\ng_{t}\\in\\mathcal{G}\n, selects actions\na\nt\n∼\nπ\nθ\n(\n⋅\n|\no\nt\n,\ng\nt\n)\na_{t}\\!\\sim\\!\\pi_{\\theta}(\\,\\cdot\\,|\\,o_{t},g_{t})\n, obtains a reward\nr\nt\n=\nr\n​\n(\ns\nt\n,\na\nt\n,\ng\nt\n)\nr_{t}=r(s_{t},a_{t},g_{t})\n, and the system evolves to a new state\ns\nt\n+\n1\n∼\nP\n(\n⋅\n|\ns\nt\n,\na\nt\n)\ns_{t+1}\\!\\sim\\!P(\\,\\cdot\\,|\\,s_{t},a_{t})\n. The goal variable\ng\nt\ng_{t}\nencodes the reference target to be tracked and can be instantiated in several forms: (i) a time-indexed reference snippet\ns\n^\nt\n:\nt\n+\nH\n\\hat{s}_{t:t+H}\nwith\nH\n≥\n0\nH\\!\\geq\\!0\n(e.g., a single step or a short window); (ii) a latent embedding\nz\nt\n=\nf\n​\n(\ns\n^\nt\n:\nt\n+\nH\n)\nz_{t}=f(\\hat{s}_{t:t+H})\nof such a snippet; or (iii) a phase variable\nϕ\nt\n∈\n[\n0\n,\n1\n]\n\\phi_{t}\\in[0,1]\nplus a trajectory identifier in the case of multiple reference motions. The policy parameters\nθ\n\\theta\nare optimized to maximize the expected discounted return over a horizon\nT\nT\nJ\n​\n(\nθ\n)\n=\n𝔼\n​\n[\n∑\nt\n=\n0\nT\n−\n1\nγ\nt\n​\nr\n​\n(\ns\nt\n,\na\nt\n,\ng\nt\n)\n]\n,\nJ(\\theta)\\;=\\;\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\sum_{t=0}^{T-1}\\gamma^{t}\\,r(s_{t},a_{t},g_{t})\\right],\nwhere the expectation is over rollouts induced by\nP\nP\nand\nπ\nθ\n\\pi_{\\theta}\n, randomized initial states, and the goal distribution.\nTraining is conducted in Isaac Lab using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)\n[\n63\n]\nas the RL algorithm. To stabilize optimization and improve convergence, all observations are normalized using an empirical running-average scheme. The actor and critic networks are modeled as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with three hidden layers and ELU activations.\nTo accelerate training while preserving the hardware deployability, we utilize an asymmetric actor-critic architecture\n[\n64\n]\n. The critic is trained using extra, privileged information available only in simulations, which enables it to estimate the value function more accurately. In contrast, the policy is limited to the observations available during hardware deployment, ensuring it can be transferred without any state estimator. This approach prevents lag and bias from estimator fusion, sidesteps the fragile contact and terrain assumptions often required by state estimators, and eliminates the need for added complexity that is not captured during training. With the learning algorithm established, we now define the specifics of the MDP.\nActor and Critic Observations\nThe Actor, otherwise known as policy, receives proprioception information along with target references\n𝐨\nt\n=\n(\n𝐨\nprop\n,\n𝐨\nref\n)\n,\n\\mathbf{o}_{t}=(\\mathbf{o}_{\\text{prop}},\\ \\mathbf{o}_{\\text{ref}}),\nthe proprioceptive part\n𝐨\nprop\n=\n(\n𝝎\nI\n​\nT\nT\n,\n𝒈\nI\nT\n,\n𝒒\nj\n,\n𝒒\n˙\nj\n,\n𝒂\nt\n−\n1\n)\n{\\mathbf{o}_{\\text{prop}}=\\big({}_{T}\\bm{\\omega}_{IT},\\ {}_{T}\\bm{g}_{I},\\ \\bm{q}_{j},\\ \\dot{\\bm{q}}_{j},\\ \\bm{a}_{t-1}\\big)}\ncontains only instantaneous onboard measurements. We intentionally exclude quantities that require a state estimator, such as global base pose or linear velocity. Here,\n𝝎\nI\n​\nT\nT\n{}_{T}\\bm{\\omega}_{IT}\nis the absolute angular velocity of the torso-attached IMU frame\n{\n𝒯\n}\n\\{\\mathcal{T}\\}\n,\n𝒈\nI\nT\n{}_{T}\\bm{g}_{I}\nis the normalized gravity vector expressed in\n{\n𝒯\n}\n\\{\\mathcal{T}\\}\n, and\n(\n𝒒\nj\n,\n𝒒\n˙\nj\n,\n𝒂\nt\n−\n1\n)\n(\\bm{q}_{j},\\dot{\\bm{q}}_{j},\\bm{a}_{t-1})\ndenote joint positions, joint velocities, and the previous action. We hypothesize that including\n𝒂\nt\n−\n1\n\\bm{a}_{t-1}\nis sufficient to infer essential information, such as contact states and base linear velocity, under nominal terrain conditions without resorting to long observation histories; it also provides the minimal temporal context needed to enforce action smoothness.\nThe reference observations\n𝐨\nref\n=\n(\n𝒓\n^\nI\n​\nB\nz\nI\n,\n𝒗\n^\nI\n​\nB\nB\n,\n𝝎\n^\nI\n​\nB\nB\n,\n𝒈\n^\nI\nB\n,\n𝒒\n^\nj\n)\n{\\mathbf{o}_{\\text{ref}}=\\big({}_{I}\\hat{\\bm{r}}^{z}_{IB},\\ {}_{B}\\hat{\\bm{v}}_{IB},\\ {}_{B}\\hat{\\bm{\\omega}}_{IB},\\ {}_{B}\\hat{\\bm{g}}_{I},\\ \\hat{\\bm{q}}_{j}\\big)}\nencode the next target state extracted from the demonstration:\n𝒓\n^\nI\n​\nB\nz\nI\n{}_{I}\\hat{\\bm{r}}^{z}_{IB}\nis the base height;\n𝒗\n^\nI\n​\nB\nB\n{}_{B}\\hat{\\bm{v}}_{IB}\nand\n𝝎\n^\nI\n​\nB\nB\n{}_{B}\\hat{\\bm{\\omega}}_{IB}\nare the absolute linear and angular base velocities expressed in the base frame\n{\nℬ\n}\n\\{\\mathcal{B}\\}\n;\n𝒈\n^\nI\nB\n{}_{B}\\hat{\\bm{g}}_{I}\nis the gravity direction in\n{\nℬ\n}\n\\{\\mathcal{B}\\}\n; and\n𝒒\n^\nj\n\\hat{\\bm{q}}_{j}\nare the reference joint positions. We deliberately avoid future-reference windows beyond this immediate next target as our ablations showed no benefit for performance or convergence speed.\nThe Critic receives the policy observations in addition to extra signals referred to as privileged information. This privileged input includes the base linear velocity, base height, end-effector positions, velocities, and contact forces, as well as curriculum-related signals. Additional details are provided in the Supplementary (Table S3).\nActions and Joint-Level Control\nThe policy outputs residual actions\n𝒂\nt\n\\bm{a}_{t}\n, which are added to the reference joint positions before sending them as position targets to the joint-level PD controllers:\n𝒒\nj\ncmd\n=\n𝒒\n^\nj\n+\n𝚺\n​\n𝒂\nt\n,\n\\bm{q}^{\\mathrm{cmd}}_{j}=\\hat{\\bm{q}}_{j}+\\bm{\\Sigma}\\,\\bm{a}_{t},\nwhere\n𝚺\n\\bm{\\Sigma}\nis a positive-definite diagonal matrix of per-DoF action scales. These scales set the amplitude of residual corrections and exploration on each axis and reflect whether additional feedforward torque is needed for reference tracking: actuators that require more assistance (e.g., hips and knees) receive larger scales, whereas those adequately handled by the PD control loop alone (e.g., the robot’s head and wrists) use smaller scales. The PD gains are chosen by modeling each joint as an independent second-order system:\nI\n​\nθ\n′′\n​\n(\nt\n)\n+\nK\nd\n​\nθ\n′\n​\n(\nt\n)\n+\nK\np\n​\nθ\n​\n(\nt\n)\n=\n0\n,\nI\\,\\theta^{\\prime\\prime}(t)+K_{d}\\,\\theta^{\\prime}(t)+K_{p}\\,\\theta(t)=0,\nwhere\nI\nI\nis the nominal armature value (refer to the Modeling section) about that axis. The gains\nK\np\nK_{p}\nand\nK\nd\nK_{d}\nare heuristically tuned to achieve a critically damped response with a desired natural frequency\nω\nn\n>\n0\n\\omega_{n}>0\n,\nK\np\n=\nI\n​\nω\nn\n2\n,\nK\nd\n=\n2\n​\nI\n​\nω\nn\n.\nK_{p}=I\\,\\omega_{n}^{2},\\qquad K_{d}=2\\,I\\,\\omega_{n}.\nIn practice, we set\nω\nn\n\\omega_{n}\nto balance between responsiveness and robustness. It is set high enough for fast tracking, but not so high that the loop becomes brittle during deployment or that simulation requires very small time steps to resolve stiff dynamics with fast transients, which would in turn increase training times. The same PD gains are used in simulation and on hardware to minimize sim-to-real mismatch.\nReward Terms\nThe total reward combines three main components: a tracking reward, a regularization reward, and a survival reward,\nr\ntotal\n=\nr\ntrack\n+\nr\nreg\n+\nr\nsurvival\n.\nr_{\\text{total}}\\;=\\;r_{\\text{track}}+r_{\\text{reg}}+r_{\\text{survival}}.\n(1)\nAll terms are deliberately kept generic: nothing is task- or motion-specific, and the reward setup does not rely on reference contact labels from the demonstrations, making it broadly applicable across behaviors. The tracking reward measures how well the policy follows the reference motion. It can be expressed in different forms, such as a quadratic penalty or a decaying exponential kernel; in our case, we adopt the latter, which yields a dense, bounded shaping signal that emphasizes accuracy near the reference and varies smoothly with the tracking error:\nr\ntrack\n=\n∑\ni\nc\nt\ni\n​\nexp\n⁡\n(\n−\nκ\n​\n‖\n𝐞\ni\n‖\n2\nσ\ni\n2\n)\n,\nr_{\\text{track}}\\;=\\;\\sum_{i}c_{t_{i}}\\exp\\!\\Bigl(-\\,\\kappa\\frac{\\|\\mathbf{e}_{i}\\|^{2}}{\\sigma_{i}^{2}}\\Bigr),\n(2)\nwhere\nc\nt\ni\nc_{t_{i}}\nis the reward weight for term\ni\ni\n, and\n𝐞\ni\n\\mathbf{e}_{i}\ndenotes the error between the current and reference values for quantities such as base linear velocity, base angular velocity, base pose, joint positions, and keybody poses. The regularization component, denoted\nr\nreg\nr_{\\text{reg}}\n, aggregates penalties that encourage smooth and physically feasible behavior. Concretely, we penalize rapid changes in actions across time steps, large joint accelerations, and violations of joint position and torque limits. The survival reward is a constant positive term granted at each step,\nr\nsurvival\n=\nc\nsurvival\nr_{\\text{survival}}=c_{\\text{survival}}\n, which discourages premature termination by rewarding longer episodes. Full functional forms and hyperparameters for all reward terms are provided in the Supplementary Materials (Table S4).\nEarly Terminations\nTo steer exploration toward promising states and avoid wasting samples on highly undesirable trajectories, we trigger early termination under conditions such as contact forces exceeding a predefined threshold or a large deviation of the agent from the reference.\nDomain Randomization\nTo ensure robust zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, we employ domain randomization to prevent the policy from overfitting to the nominal simulation model. Our domain randomization strategy includes injecting Gaussian noise into observations, applying random impulsive pushes to the robot at random times, varying surface friction coefficient, and slightly randomizing link masses around their nominal values. We used these randomizations carefully, as excessive variability can degrade performance by making policies overly conservative or aggressive. The details of the domain randomization’s hyperparameters can be found in the Supplementary (Table S5).\nAdaptive Reference State Initialization\nTo initialize our environment during training, we first adopt the Reference State Initialization (RSI) strategy introduced in\n[\n29\n]\n. At each reset, a random phase\nϕ\ninit\n∼\n𝒰\n​\n(\n0\n,\n1\n)\n\\phi_{\\text{init}}\\!\\sim\\!\\mathcal{U}(0,1)\nis sampled. Then the environment is initialized at the corresponding reference state\ns\n^\n​\n(\nϕ\ninit\n)\n\\hat{s}(\\phi_{\\text{init}})\n. RSI exposes the policy to relevant states along the trajectory from the outset, decouples episode length from demonstration length, and improves sample efficiency. Additionally, when a rollout reaches the end of a demonstration, we insert a brief dwell and then reset by timeout (not failure), which further increases the number of informative transitions.\nWhile uniform RSI is generally effective, with long-horizon trajectories or large sets of trajectories, it can be inefficient because it blindly samples phases, oversampling already-mastered regions and undersampling difficult segments. To bias sampling toward where learning is most needed, we use an adaptive RSI scheme: all demonstrations are partitioned into fixed\nN\nN\n-step bins, and each bin\nb\nb\nmaintains a failure level\nf\nb\nf_{b}\nderived from recent tracking performance (based on a similarity score metric) and updated with an EMA filter. At reset, a bin index\nk\nk\nis drawn from a categorical distribution whose logits are proportional to\n{\nf\nb\n}\n\\{f_{b}\\}\n, and a phase is then sampled uniformly within the selected bin to obtain\nϕ\ninit\n\\phi_{\\text{init}}\n; a small floor probability is retained for every bin to prevent forgetting previously acquired skills. This procedure increases sampling density on difficult motions and difficult phases while preserving global coverage; additional implementation details are provided in the Supplementary (Section S5).\nAssistive Wrench Automatic Curriculum\nWhile the framework presented so far is sufficient to track most motions in our library, skills with highly dynamic base rotations and large angular rates (e.g., handstands, cartwheels, backflips) tend to trigger immediate early terminations under RSI alone and converge significantly slower compared to simpler behaviors such as walking and running. To address this, we employ an automatic assistive-wrench curriculum, serving as a continuation strategy that gradually increases task difficulty: a virtual spatial wrench is applied at the base and annealed as tracking improves, analogous to a gymnastics coach providing diminishing support to their student. Similar assistive-force curricula have been explored in previous related works\n[\n65\n,\n66\n,\n67\n,\n68\n]\n. The assistive wrench is computed in a model-based fashion using a PD term on the base pose tracking error, together with a feedforward component that compensates nominal torso dynamics. To keep assistance partially supportive while still compelling the agent to learn the skill for itself, we scale the assistive wrench by a gain\nβ\n∈\n(\n0\n,\nβ\nmax\n)\n{\\beta\\!\\in\\!(0,\\beta_{\\text{max}})}\nwith\nβ\nmax\n<\n1.0\n{\\beta_{\\text{max}}<1.0}\n. The annealing schedule is driven automatically by the per-bin failure levels introduced in the adaptive RSI procedure: bins with higher failure receive stronger assistance initially and are relaxed more aggressively as tracking improves. Assistance decays quickly and ultimately vanishes once a target tracking performance is reached. Additional details are provided in the Supplementary (Section S6).\nHardware Deployment Pipeline\nAn important yet often overlooked aspect of embodied intelligence is the hardware deployment pipeline. Since our research involves frequent testing on physical robots, we created an efficient, automated, framework- and hardware-agnostic pipeline to ensure safe and consistent releases across multiple platforms. This pipeline follows a three-stage workflow. First, during training, policy checkpoints are exported in ONNX format and logged to a registry, along with detailed metadata that captures all relevant configurations. For validation, these artifacts are retrieved, and the metadata is used to automatically configure the controller in our\nevaluation simulator\n[\n69\n]\n, which mirrors the hardware’s software stack. Once a policy performs as expected, it is deployed to the physical robot using the exact same automated process, guaranteeing consistency and eliminating manual setup errors. It is worth noting that while some deployment workflow is necessary for hardware testing, the learned policy is not tied to this specific pipeline; we include it primarily to accelerate iteration and reduce incidental sources of error during sim-to-sim evaluation and hardware testing.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Merritt Moore for the MoCap data collection.

Implementation Details: Actuator Modeling\nThe PLA systems in humanoid robots are essential hardware components that help reduce limb inertia by positioning the actuators closer to the body, which enhances dynamic performance. Nonetheless, enforcing their loop-closure constraints leads to large internal forces, making the simulation of dynamics stiff and substantially increasing the computational cost of the iterative Temporal Gauss-Seidel solver used for numerical integration. Since an entirely accurate model is too slow for large-scale RL training, we tackle this trade-off between fidelity and efficiency by developing a series of progressive approximations to model the PLAs.\nThis section details the formulation of our progressive PLA approximation models and provides an experimental validation of their accuracy. It concludes the section by showcasing the importance of considering configuration-dependent torque limits of the PLA actuators.\nProjected Model\nHere, we formulate an analytically exact\nProjected Model\nto circumvent the numerical constraint enforcement used in standard simulators. We begin by deriving the general equation of motion for a class of systems that contain a closed-kinematic chain. An instance of such a mechanism is the four-bar linkage, illustrated in Figure 4, where the primary kinematic chain consists of the floating base, thigh, shank, and their connecting joints. The PLA’s actuation is provided by a motor mounted on the thigh, which drives the knee joint through a four-bar linkage. Our objective is to project the dynamics of the PLA’s support links onto the main kinematic chain. To analyze the dynamics of PLA, we conceptually decompose its closed-loop structure into two overlapping open kinematic chains: a\nmain chain\n,\nℳ\n\\mathcal{M}\n, and a\nsupport chain\n,\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\n, as illustrated in Figure.\nS1\n.\n•\nThe\nmain chain\n,\nℳ\n\\mathcal{M}\n, is comprised of the robot’s primary kinematic tree, the PLA’s parent link, and its unactuated branch.\n•\nThe\nsupport chain\n,\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\n, consists of the PLA’s support links, which also originate from the same parent link.\nA central assumption of this decomposition is that while the parent link is fully modeled with its physical mass in chain\nℳ\n\\mathcal{M}\n, it is considered massless in the support chain,\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\n, to avoid double-counting inertial properties. We will further assume that the velocity of the PLA joints in the support kinematic chain, including the actuated joints\n𝐪\ni\n\\mathbf{q}_{i}\nand dependent joints,\n𝐪\nd\n\\mathbf{q}_{d}\n, can be calculated based on the velocity of the PLA joints in the main kinematic chain,\n𝐪\no\n\\mathbf{q}_{o}\n,\n[\n𝐪\n˙\nd\n𝐪\n˙\ni\n]\n=\n[\n𝚪\nd\n​\n(\n𝐪\no\n)\n𝚪\ni\n​\n(\n𝐪\no\n)\n]\n​\n𝐪\n˙\no\n,\n\\begin{bmatrix}\\dot{\\mathbf{q}}_{d}\\\\\n\\dot{\\mathbf{q}}_{i}\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}\\bm{\\Gamma}_{d}(\\mathbf{q}_{o})\\\\\n\\bm{\\Gamma}_{i}(\\mathbf{q}_{o})\\end{bmatrix}\\dot{\\mathbf{q}}_{o},\n(3)\nwhere\n𝚪\nd\n\\bm{\\Gamma}_{d}\nand\n𝚪\ni\n\\bm{\\Gamma}_{i}\ndenote the kinematic mappings from the main chain joint velocities to the dependent and actuated joints, respectively.\nTo simplify our derivation, we focus on a scenario where the parent joints are unactuated and the entire system is free from external forces, with actuation occurring only through the PLA. While extending this analysis to a more general case is straightforward, we will not cover it here to keep the discussion concise. The dynamics of the main chain and auxiliary chain can then be expressed as follows:\n𝐌\nℳ\n\\displaystyle\\mathbf{M}_{\\mathcal{M}}\n[\n𝐪\n¨\np\n𝐪\n¨\no\n]\n+\n𝐡\nℳ\n=\n𝐉\nℳ\n⊤\n​\n𝐅\n\\displaystyle\\begin{bmatrix}\\ddot{\\mathbf{q}}_{p}\\\\\n\\ddot{\\mathbf{q}}_{o}\\end{bmatrix}+\\mathbf{h}_{\\mathcal{M}}=\\mathbf{J}_{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\top}\\mathbf{F}\n(4)\n𝐌\n𝒮\n\\displaystyle\\mathbf{M}_{\\mathcal{S}}\n[\n𝐪\n¨\np\n𝐪\n¨\nd\n𝐪\n¨\ni\n]\n+\n𝐡\n𝒮\n=\n[\n0\n0\n𝝉\ni\n]\n−\n𝐉\n𝒮\n⊤\n​\n𝐅\n,\n\\displaystyle\\begin{bmatrix}\\ddot{\\mathbf{q}}_{p}\\\\\n\\ddot{\\mathbf{q}}_{d}\\\\\n\\ddot{\\mathbf{q}}_{i}\\end{bmatrix}+\\mathbf{h}_{\\mathcal{S}}=\\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\\n0\\\\\n\\bm{\\tau}_{i}\\end{bmatrix}-\\mathbf{J}_{\\mathcal{S}}^{\\top}\\mathbf{F},\n(5)\nwhere\n𝐌\nℳ\n\\mathbf{M}_{\\mathcal{M}}\nand\n𝐡\nℳ\n\\mathbf{h}_{\\mathcal{M}}\nare the mass matrix and the nonlinear forces of the main chain, and\n𝐌\n𝒮\n\\mathbf{M}_{\\mathcal{S}}\n,\n𝐡\n𝒮\n\\mathbf{h}_{\\mathcal{S}}\ndenote those of the support chain.

This structural incompatibility prevents its direct application, leading us to create subsequent approximate models that are tailored to be compatible with simulators.\nLocally Projected Model: Massless-Links Approximation\nOur first approximation is motivated by the lightweight design of the support links in the parallel kinematic chain of PLAs. We assume that these support links are massless while still accounting for the full inertia of the motor armatures and the main kinematic chain of PLA. By treating the support links as massless and considering the Coriolis forces,\n𝐡\n𝒮\n\\mathbf{h}_{\\mathcal{S}}\n, to be negligible, we can derive:\n(\n𝐌\nℳ\n+\n[\n0\n0\n0\n𝐌\no\n]\n)\n​\n[\n𝐪\n¨\np\n𝐪\n¨\no\n]\n+\n𝐡\nℳ\n+\n[\n0\n𝐡\n0\n]\n=\n[\n0\n𝝉\no\n]\n,\n\\Big(\\mathbf{M}_{\\mathcal{M}}+\\begin{bmatrix}0&0\\\\\n0&\\mathbf{M}_{o}\\end{bmatrix}\\Big)\\begin{bmatrix}\\ddot{\\mathbf{q}}_{p}\\\\\n\\ddot{\\mathbf{q}}_{o}\\end{bmatrix}+\\mathbf{h}_{\\mathcal{M}}+\\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\\n\\mathbf{h}_{0}\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\\n\\bm{\\tau}_{o}\\end{bmatrix},\n(9)\nwhere\n𝐌\no\n​\n(\n𝐪\no\n)\n=\n𝚪\ni\n⊤\n​\n𝐈\ni\n​\n𝚪\ni\n\\mathbf{M}_{o}(\\mathbf{q}_{o})=\\bm{\\Gamma}_{i}^{\\top}\\mathbf{I}_{i}\\bm{\\Gamma}_{i}\nis the locally projected mass matrix, under the assumption that\n𝐌\n𝒮\n=\nDiag\n​\n(\n0\n,\n𝐈\ni\n)\n\\mathbf{M}_{\\mathcal{S}}=\\text{Diag}(0,\\mathbf{I}_{i})\nis diagonal and only encodes the PLA actuator armature values, with\n𝐈\ni\n\\mathbf{I}_{i}\nrepresenting the motor armatures of the PLA.

In this model, the armature values (inertia terms added to the diagonal of the mass matrix) depend on the configuration. In a simulator like Isaac Lab, this can be implemented by updating the armature values at each simulation step using a lookup table.\nDynamic Armature Model: Diagonal Approximation\nAlthough the\nLocally Projected Model\nis local, meaning that the dynamics of the PLA actuators only affect themselves and are solely a function of the PLA’s output joint, it should be noted that\n𝐌\no\n\\mathbf{M}_{o}\nis not necessarily diagonal even though\n𝐈\n𝒾\n\\mathbf{I}_{\\mathcal{i}}\nis diagonal. Since standard simulators cannot accommodate off-diagonal terms, this model faces limitations when applied to coupled PLAs, such as those found in the ankles of Atlas and G1, where two actuators simultaneously drive the ankle pitch and roll joints. To resolve this, we propose our second approximation, which we refer to as the\nDynamic Armature Model\n. To derive this model, we decompose\n𝐌\no\n\\mathbf{M}_{o}\ninto two components:\nD\no\nD_{o}\n, which is a diagonal matrix, and\nO\no\nO_{o}\n, which represents the off-diagonal elements. We then define the model as follows:\n(\n𝐌\nℳ\n+\n[\n0\n0\n0\nD\no\n]\n)\n​\n[\n𝐪\n¨\np\n𝐪\n¨\no\n]\n+\n𝐡\nℳ\n+\n[\n0\n𝐡\n0\n+\nO\no\n​\n𝐪\n¨\no\n]\n=\n[\n0\n𝝉\no\n]\n.\n\\Big(\\mathbf{M}_{\\mathcal{M}}+\\begin{bmatrix}0&0\\\\\n0&D_{o}\\end{bmatrix}\\Big)\\begin{bmatrix}\\ddot{\\mathbf{q}}_{p}\\\\\n\\ddot{\\mathbf{q}}_{o}\\end{bmatrix}+\\mathbf{h}_{\\mathcal{M}}+\\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\\n\\mathbf{h}_{0}+O_{o}\\ddot{\\mathbf{q}}_{o}\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\\n\\bm{\\tau}_{o}\\end{bmatrix}.\n(10)\nIn the next step, instead of using\n𝐪\n¨\no\n\\ddot{\\mathbf{q}}_{o}\n, we will use the previous joint acceleration of the PLA, denoted as\n𝐪\n¨\no\n′\n\\ddot{\\mathbf{q}}_{o}^{{}^{\\prime}}\n.\n(\n𝐌\nℳ\n+\n[\n0\n0\n0\nD\no\n]\n)\n​\n[\n𝐪\n¨\np\n𝐪\n¨\no\n]\n+\n𝐡\nℳ\n+\n[\n0\n𝐡\n0\n+\nO\no\n​\n𝐪\n¨\no\n′\n]\n=\n[\n0\n𝝉\no\n]\n.\n\\Big(\\mathbf{M}_{\\mathcal{M}}+\\begin{bmatrix}0&0\\\\\n0&D_{o}\\end{bmatrix}\\Big)\\begin{bmatrix}\\ddot{\\mathbf{q}}_{p}\\\\\n\\ddot{\\mathbf{q}}_{o}\\end{bmatrix}+\\mathbf{h}_{\\mathcal{M}}+\\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\\n\\mathbf{h}_{0}+O_{o}\\ddot{\\mathbf{q}}_{o}^{{}^{\\prime}}\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\\n\\bm{\\tau}_{o}\\end{bmatrix}.\n(11)\nThe\nDynamic Armature Model\nprovides a Jacobi approximation of the\nLocally Projected Model\n, representing the PLA dynamics as two components: a configuration-dependent diagonal armature and a fictitious torque. This fictitious torque, which accounts for the off-diagonal dynamic effects, is calculated using the PLA joint acceleration from the previous timestep. This approximation introduces only a transient error, provided the system’s mass matrix is diagonally dominant. We have empirically verified that this condition holds for the Atlas ankle by sweeping its whole workspace.\nNominal Armature Model: Fixed-Configuration Approximation\nThus far, our approximations have produced a compatible model with minimal error. However, the suggested configuration-dependent armature matrix creates a practical bottleneck. Updating armature values at each simulation step incurs a significant computational overhead (approximately 20% in Isaac Lab). To address this issue, we introduce our final and strongest approximation, the\nNominal Armature Model\n. This model computes the joint armatures once at a single, well-chosen nominal configuration and then fixes these values throughout training, denoted by\nD\n¯\no\n\\bar{D}_{o}\nand\nO\n¯\no\n\\bar{O}_{o}\n. The dynamics of the\nNominal Armature Model\nare as follows:\n(\n𝐌\nℳ\n+\n[\n0\n0\n0\nD\n¯\no\n]\n)\n​\n[\n𝐪\n¨\np\n𝐪\n¨\no\n]\n+\n𝐡\nℳ\n+\n[\n0\n𝐡\n0\n+\nO\n¯\no\n​\n𝐪\n¨\no\n′\n]\n=\n[\n0\n𝝉\no\n]\n,\n\\Big(\\mathbf{M}_{\\mathcal{M}}+\\begin{bmatrix}0&0\\\\\n0&\\bar{D}_{o}\\end{bmatrix}\\Big)\\begin{bmatrix}\\ddot{\\mathbf{q}}_{p}\\\\\n\\ddot{\\mathbf{q}}_{o}\\end{bmatrix}+\\mathbf{h}_{\\mathcal{M}}+\\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\\n\\mathbf{h}_{0}+\\bar{O}_{o}\\ddot{\\mathbf{q}}_{o}^{{}^{\\prime}}\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\\n\\bm{\\tau}_{o}\\end{bmatrix},\n(12)\nThis model enables adding the projected armature (of the motors on the closed kinematic chain) to the main kinematic tree when training is initialized. Crucially, this single set of nominal armature values serves a dual purpose: it simplifies the simulation dynamics and it provides a principled basis for designing the fixed PD gains of our low-level controller.\nPLA Models Evaluation\nTo quantify the accuracy of our approximations, we compare them to the actual model. In addition to the models mentioned above, we also evaluate a baseline known as the\nSimplest Model\n, which excludes all fictitious torque from the\nNominal Armature\nmodel.\nThe tests are conducted using the Atlas ankle, which is commanded to follow a 5 Hz sinusoidal trajectory in both pitch and roll, with an amplitude of half the joint position limit. To measure performance, we calculate the joint acceleration of each approximate model and determine the error relative to the actual model. This error is normalized at each timestep, and we report the final Mean Squared Error (MSE) for each model in Table\nS2\n.\nThe\nLocally Projected\n,\nDynamic Armature\nand\nNominal Armature\nmodels all demonstrate behaviors that closely match those of the exact model, indicating that the assumption of massless support links and the Jacobi approximation are valid. Although the\nSimplest Model\nshows relatively larger errors, these errors primarily manifest as a shift in the motion, and the resulting motion is quite similar to that of the actual model. Given that the motion of the\nSimplest Model\nis qualitatively similar, its simplicity makes it an attractive option, especially since the RL policy could learn to compensate for these model discrepancies. As a result, in some of the training runs, we opted to use this model.\nImpact of PLA Modeling on Sim-To-Real Transfer\nTo better isolate the effect of PLA modeling on sim-to-real transfer, we performed a controlled comparison that holds the remainder of the pipeline fixed while varying only the armature model, which is also used to compute the joint-level PD gains. Specifically, we compare our\nnominal armature model\nfor the Unitree G1 robot, which accounts for the parallel linkages at the waist and ankle, against an\nunprojected\nvariant that ignores these linkages. For both models, we use the same PD gain design recipe and hyperparameters (i.e., the same natural frequency and damping ratio), and we keep all other training components identical. In simulation, the two setups exhibit similar training curves and comparable success during rollout evaluation. On hardware, however, the difference becomes clear: across three representative behaviors—namely the cartwheel motion, the ping-pong sequence, and the box climb down—the policy using the nominal armature model transfers reliably, whereas the policy trained with unprojected armatures consistently fails during execution. Qualitative comparisons are provided in Movie S8.\nPLA Torque Limits\nThe equation (\n8\n) defines the relationship between the input torque and the output torque of the PLA. This mapping is dependent on the configuration, meaning that the output torque limits are not simply box limits, even though the input space does have box limits. An approximation approach is to use box limits. However, this can lead to either overly conservative or overly optimistic results. Figure\nS2\nillustrates the configuration-dependent torque limits on the Atlas ankle at specific joint roll and pitch angles, compared to the fixed boundary approximation. We sweep the ankle pitch–roll joint space over its position limits. At each pitch–roll joint pair, we calculate the transmission Jacobian\n𝚪\ni\n\\bm{\\Gamma}_{i}\n(eq.(\n3\n)) and apply this linear transformation to the box limit in the motor space, resulting in a sequence of parallelograms. As shown, the fixed limits significantly underestimate the possible torque output.\nSection S3. Implementation Details: Spot Modeling\nTo bridge the sim-to-real gap for the more challenging continuous backflip behavior, we incorporated a more accurate model of Spot’s power system and actuators in simulation.\nFirst, we modeled Spot’s power system. Spot employs a power-limiting algorithm that sums the requested mechanical power and resistive losses across all actuators and selectively saturates the commanded torque to maintain the total system power within defined limits. We replicated this algorithm in simulation so that policies would experience the same constraints during training\n2\n2\n2\nFurther details of this algorithm cannot be provided, as they involve proprietary industrial information.\n. Second, we modeled the motor and transmission efficiencies. At high currents, the motor constant of an electric motor decreases. We modeled this magnet saturation effect using the following equation:\nτ\no\n​\nu\n​\nt\n=\nτ\ni\n​\nn\n1\n+\nk\n​\n|\nτ\ni\n​\nn\n|\n,\n\\tau_{out}=\\frac{\\tau_{in}}{1+k|\\tau_{in}|},\nwith\nτ\no\n​\nu\n​\nt\n\\tau_{out}\ndenoting output torque,\nτ\ni\n​\nn\n\\tau_{in}\ninput torque, and\nk\nk\na derating constant. Torque losses from transmission inefficiencies and friction were modeled using the following equation:\nτ\no\n​\nu\n​\nt\n=\nη\n​\n(\nτ\ni\n​\nn\n−\nI\n​\nα\n)\n−\nK\nc\n​\ntanh\n⁡\n(\ns\n​\nω\n)\n−\nK\nv\n​\nω\n,\n\\tau_{out}=\\eta(\\tau_{in}-I\\alpha)-K_{c}\\tanh{(s\\omega)}-K_{v}\\omega,\nwhere\nI\nI\nis the rotor inertia,\nα\n\\alpha\nthe joint acceleration,\nK\nc\nK_{c}\nthe Coulomb friction constant,\ns\ns\na smoothing factor,\nω\n\\omega\nthe joint velocity,\nK\nv\nK_{v}\nthe viscous friction constant, and\nη\n\\eta\nthe transmission efficiency. Two values of\nη\n\\eta\nare used, depending on whether the motor performs positive or negative work. The complete actuator model is thus expressed as:\nτ\no\n​\nu\n​\nt\n=\nη\n​\n(\nτ\ni\n​\nn\n1\n+\nk\n​\n|\nτ\ni\n​\nn\n|\n−\nI\n​\nα\n)\n−\nK\nc\n​\ntanh\n⁡\n(\ns\n​\nω\n)\n−\nK\nv\n​\nω\n.\n\\tau_{out}=\\eta\\Big(\\frac{\\tau_{in}}{1+k|\\tau_{in}|}-I\\alpha\\Big)-K_{c}\\tanh{(s\\omega)}-K_{v}\\omega.\nThe actuator model output was low-pass filtered for simulation stability. Parameters\nk\nk\n,\nI\nI\n,\nK\nc\nK_{c}\n,\ns\ns\n, and\nK\nv\nK_{v}\nwere sourced directly from the manufacturer’s specifications. To define the randomization range for\nη\n\\eta\n, we recorded joint torques during dynamic maneuvers (such as a continuous backflip) and estimated the parameters through optimization. The minimum and maximum values set the domain randomization ranges for each actuator type.\nSection S4. Implementation Details: Motion Dataset\nIn this section, we briefly present the three data sources used in this project.\nMoCap Data\nMoCap was used to gather high-quality motion references of a human using a combination of Xsens and Vicon systems. Human skeletons from different data sources can vary in animation bone layout, naming, and proportions due to differences in software conventions and variations in morphology among actors. Retargeting is performed in two stages to convert these into robot trajectories.\nIn the first stage, animation of skeletons is exported to\n.bvh\nformat and retargeted to a target skeleton with human-like kinematics and spherical joints, but proportions similar to the target robot. Alignment frames are placed on the source skeleton bones corresponding to the head, torso, upper arms, lower arms, hands, pelvis, knees, and feet. Optimization is used to minimize spacetime constraint violations between those frames and their counterparts on the target skeleton by solving for the target skeleton’s joint poses at all timesteps. We also jointly optimize a uniform scaling of the source data, resampling time inversely with the scale to preserve a gravitational constant of\n9.81\n​\nm/s\n2\n9.81\\,\\text{m/s}^{2}\nin ballistic motion. The second stage applies kinematic retargeting, mapping the resulting motions to the target robot.\nViCap Data\nTo leverage the vast amount of motion data available in online videos, we use a custom 3D motion extraction pipeline to reconstruct global human motion, including full-body poses and joint angles, from monocular video recordings (e.g., from a cellphone). While this process yields detailed, high-fidelity motion, the resulting data is prone to more artifacts than MoCap. The process consists of two main stages. In the first stage, we utilize\nMegaSaM\nto recover the camera trajectory in the world frame, as well as the underlying scene structure and the global metric scale. In the second stage, we estimate human motion as an\nSMPL\nmodel in the camera frame using\nTRAM\n, and then map these poses to world coordinates using the transformation derived from\nMegaSaM\n. While the original\nTRAM\nimplementation integrates these two steps, we found that substituting the first stage with\nMegaSaM\nsignificantly reduces artifacts such as character misorientation, sliding, and floating. Finally, the extracted\nSMPL\nmotion is retargeted to either the Atlas or G1 through kinematic retargeting. Before this process, the\nSMPL\nskeleton is uniformly scaled to match the target robot, with the scaling factor chosen by matching the\nSMPL\nthigh bone length to that of the robot.\nKeyframe Animation\nWe utilize keyframe animation for two primary purposes: first, to create movements that are not achievable by humans, such as utilizing the continuous rotation joint of the robot; and second, to generate motions for non-humanoid morphologies, like the Spot quadruped, where collecting real-world animal data is challenging. As these motions are authored with the target robot’s kinematics in mind, they typically do not require any retargeting.\nSection S5.

Simultaneously, the adaptive RSI scheme increases the sampling frequency of challenging bins until their failure levels subside while preserving coverage via the sampler’s floor probability, yielding a simple, performance-coupled continuation scheme that is guaranteed to decay assistance to zero at the desired similarity threshold.\nFigure S1\n:\nIllustration of main chain and support chain.

Curves show the mean success rate, the 10th percentile (p10),\nand the minimum across multiple trajectories. Overall, increasing the future-reference horizon tends to\nreduce performance, with degraded lower-tail behavior (p10/min) at longer horizons. Increasing observation\nhistory is even more detrimental: performance drops more sharply, especially in the lower tail, as history\nlength grows, indicating that stacking past observations is harmful in this setting.\n(a)\nPushes.\n(b)\nMass.\n(c)\nFriction.\n(d)\nObservation noise.\n(e)\nInitial state.\n(f)\nActuator delay.\nFigure S4\n:\nRobustness to model uncertainty and disturbances.\nWe evaluate a single policy under controlled robustness stress tests and report normalized success statistics\n(mean, p10, and minimum over multiple trajectories), divided by the nominal (no-randomization) performance so that\nthe baseline at randomization level 0 equals 1.0. Unless noted otherwise, the policy was trained with\nrandomization level 1, and levels 2–3 extrapolate beyond the training distribution.\nActuator delay\nhas the strongest effect in this suite; importantly, delay randomization was\nnot\nincluded\nduring training, yet performance remains acceptable for modest delays (randomization levels 1–3, corresponding to\nuniformly sampled delays of 0–1, 0–2, and 0–3 control steps), suggesting that other training randomizations\n(e.g., observation/action noise and dynamics randomization) provide indirect robustness to latency.\nAmong the randomizations used during training,\ninitial-state perturbations\nhave the largest impact, producing\nthe steepest drop in both mean and lower-tail performance. We attribute this primarily to the fact that aggressive\ninitial-state perturbations can spawn the robot in self-colliding configurations (e.g., arm–torso collisions) that are\neffectively irreversible under the controller, leading to a higher probability of early failure.\nPush disturbances\nand\nfriction variation\nexhibit the next strongest degradation, particularly in the tail\n(p10/min), reflecting reduced robustness under aggressive external forces and contact parameter shifts.\nIn contrast,\nmass variation\nand\nobservation noise\nhave comparatively mild effects over the tested range,\nsuggesting the learned controller is largely invariant to these sources.\n(a)\nBox climb up.\n(b)\nBox climb down.\nFigure S5\n:\nRobustness maps for box-climbing policies from varied initial conditions (top-down view).\nEach trial is drawn at its initial planar offset\n(\nΔ\n​\nx\n,\nΔ\n​\ny\n)\n(\\Delta x,\\Delta y)\nrelative to the box, with heading indicated by a short arrow oriented by the initial yaw\nΔ\n​\nψ\n\\Delta\\psi\n; green indicates success and red indicates failure.\nAxes follow the manuscript convention:\nx\nx\npoints upward and\ny\ny\npoints left.\nThe box footprint is shown as a light rectangle (80 cm along\nx\nx\nand 120 cm along\ny\ny\n); in this zoomed view, only the portion of the footprint within the plotted window is visible.\nThe dashed black square indicates the training randomization range\nΔ\n​\nx\n,\nΔ\n​\ny\n∈\n[\n−\n10\n,\n10\n]\n\\Delta x,\\Delta y\\in[-10,10]\ncm, and the dashed blue arc indicates yaw randomization\nΔ\n​\nψ\n∈\n[\n−\n0.3\n,\n0.3\n]\n\\Delta\\psi\\in[-0.3,0.3]\nrad.\nLeft\n: nominal robot start is defined at\n(\n0\n,\n0\n)\n(0,0)\nwith the box center located 60 cm ahead along\n+\nx\n+x\n.\nRight\n: nominal robot start is aligned with the box center at\n(\n0\n,\n0\n)\n(0,0)\n.

    "preview_text": "Achieving robust, human-like whole-body control on humanoid robots for agile, contact-rich behaviors remains a central challenge, demanding heavy per-skill engineering and a brittle process of tuning controllers. We introduce ZEST (Zero-shot Embodied Skill Transfer), a streamlined motion-imitation framework that trains policies via reinforcement learning from diverse sources -- high-fidelity motion capture, noisy monocular video, and non-physics-constrained animation -- and deploys them to hardware zero-shot. ZEST generalizes across behaviors and platforms while avoiding contact labels, reference or observation windows, state estimators, and extensive reward shaping. Its training pipeline combines adaptive sampling, which focuses training on difficult motion segments, and an automatic curriculum using a model-based assistive wrench, together enabling dynamic, long-horizon maneuvers. We further provide a procedure for selecting joint-level gains from approximate analytical armature values for closed-chain actuators, along with a refined model of actuators. Trained entirely in simulation with moderate domain randomization, ZEST demonstrates remarkable generality. On Boston Dynamics' Atlas humanoid, ZEST learns dynamic, multi-contact skills (e.g., army crawl, breakdancing) from motion capture. It transfers expressive dance and scene-interaction skills, such as box-climbing, directly from videos to Atlas and the Unitree G1. Furthermore, it extends across morphologies to the Spot quadruped, enabling acrobatics, such as a continuous backflip, through animation. Together, these results demonstrate robust zero-shot deployment across heterogeneous data sources and embodiments, establishing ZEST as a scalable interface between biological movements and their robotic counterparts.\n\nZEST: Zero-shot Embodied Skill Transfer for\nAthletic Robot Control\nJean-Pierre Sleiman\nHe Li\nAlphonsus Adu-Bredu\nRobin Deits\nArun Kumar\nKevin Bergamin\nMohak Bhardwaj\nScott Biddlestone\nNicola Burger\nM",

            "answer": "## ZEST论文分析：基于前作的技能迁移发展脉络梳理\n\n本文提出的**ZEST (Zero-shot Embodied Skill Transfer)** 框架，是机器人运动模仿与控制领域长期发展的一个集大成者和重要突破。其核心目标是将多样化的运动数据（动捕、视频、动画）转化为可在机器人上**零样本部署**的鲁棒控制策略，并跨越不同的机器人形态。\n\n为了深入理解ZEST的创新，我们需梳理其技术脉络，它主要建立在**三个并行且相互交织的发展方向**之上：\n\n### 方向一：从“离线规划，在线跟踪”到“数据驱动的端到端控制”\n\n这个方向关注**控制范式的根本转变**。\n\n1.  **传统模型基范式 (Model-based “Plan offline, track online”)**\n    *   **代表工作**：波士顿动力Atlas的跑酷/舞蹈（基于MPC和全身优化控制器）、使用扶手爬楼梯的人形机器人、展示特技的四足机器人等。\n    *   **核心**：通过离线轨迹优化（常为多接触）生成动态可行的行为，再由通用的模型基控制器（如MPC）在线跟踪。\n    *   **优点**：通用性强、可解释性好。\n    *   **局限**：**严重依赖精确的环境建模、状态估计和高质量的参考轨迹**。对于接触复杂、不确定性高的场景（如全身接触、滑动），设计稳定控制器极其困难。\n\n2.  **强化学习范式 (Reinforcement Learning)**\n    *   **代表工作**：在复杂地形上鲁棒导航的四足机器人、高速奔跑、极限跑酷、灵巧操作等。\n    *   **改进**：RL通过与环境交互，**隐式地学习管理复杂的接触动力学**，无需预定义接触时序，简化了控制设计。利用高保真仿真和零样本迁移技术，实现了卓越的敏捷性和鲁棒性。\n    *   **局限**：**样本效率低、对奖励函数设计高度敏感**（“白板”RL）。不当的奖励设计会导致策略利用漏洞，产生不自然或过于激进的行为。\n\n3.  **数据引导的RL范式 (Data-guided RL)**\n    *   **代表工作**：`DeepMimic`（用动捕数据正则化策略）、`AMP`（对抗性运动先验）、`CALM`（可引导的潜在技能模型）。\n    *   **改进**：引入**运动数据作为先验**来正则化策略学习，引导控制器产生更自然的运动，**大幅减少了对复杂奖励工程的需求**。数据（无论是显式参考片段还是对抗性先验）成为简化设计、提升运动质量和扩展行为库的强大工具。\n    *   **局限**：这些工作主要在**仿真环境**中取得突破，忽略了执行器的真实物理极限（扭矩、速度），且通常需要全局状态或历史观测，增加了部署复杂度。\n\n4.  **ZEST的贡献 (本工作)**\n    *   **改进与整合**：ZEST继承了数据引导RL的思想，但**将其推向了一个极其精简和统一的硬件部署框架**。\n        *   **统一处理异构数据**：首次在**单一框架**内，成功处理了高保真动捕、带噪声的单目视频重建、以及非物理约束的动画数据，并实现了零样本硬件迁移。\n        *   **消除复杂组件**：**刻意避免了**接触标签、长时参考/观测窗口、外部状态估计器、复杂的多阶段训练流程和大量的奖励塑形。\n        *   **关注真实物理**：通过改进的**执行器建模**（特别是并联连杆机构PLA）和基于模型推导的**PD增益调参**，使仿真更贴近真实硬件，这是零样本迁移成功的关键基础。\n\n### 方向二：从“仿真技能”到“零样本的物理机器人技能”\n\n这个方向关注**跨越仿真到现实鸿沟 (Sim-to-Real Gap)** 的实践。\n\n1.  **早期仿真到现实的尝试**\n    *   **代表工作**：`VideoMimic`（利用日常视频训练全身策略）、`ASAP`（通过“真实-仿真-真实”管道和增量动作模型减小鸿沟）、`KungfuBot`（通过多步运动处理实现动态运动）。\n    *   **改进**：开始利用**更易获取的数据源（如视频）**，并设计专门的流程（如运动后处理、增量学习）来应对数据噪声和模型不匹配。\n    *   **局限**：**流程复杂、多阶段、且常针对特定机器人或行为**。依赖于手工组件，如接触标注、特定的奖励项，可扩展性和通用性受限。\n\n2.  **基于优化轨迹的模仿**\n    *   **代表工作**：`Opt-Mimic`、`DTC`（训练策略来模仿优化后的规划轨迹）。\n    *   **改进**：结合了轨迹优化的**精确性**和RL跟踪控制器的**鲁棒性**。\n    *   **局限**：仍然需要**生成高质量的优化轨迹作为参考**，这本身可能就是一个计算密集型或需要领域知识的过程。\n\n3.  **大规模模仿与师生蒸馏**\n    *   **代表工作**：`OmniH2O`（将运动学姿态作为通用接口）、`HOVER`（通过掩码命令空间蒸馏教师策略）、`GMT`（自适应采样 + 混合专家教师）。\n    *   **改进**：通过**在大规模、多样化的运动数据集上预训练“教师”策略**，然后蒸馏到仅使用本体感知的“学生”策略，实现了**高性能、多模态的统一控制**。\n    *   **局限**：虽然性能强大，但**管道通常涉及多阶段训练和复杂的网络架构**（如混合专家），且对特定平台的数据集依赖较强。\n\n4.  **ZEST的贡献 (本工作)**\n    *   **改进与整合**：ZEST追求**极简与通用**，在保持高性能的同时，大幅简化了流程。\n        *   **单阶段、最小化配方**：使用简单的**前馈网络**，在**单一阶段**内从异构数据训练策略，**超参数集在每类机器人上固定**。\n        *   **创新的训练技术**：\n            *   **自适应参考状态初始化**：根据失败率偏置采样，专注于难学的运动片段，解决了长时程、多技能学习中的灾难性遗忘问题。\n            *   **自动辅助力矩课程**：对高动态行为（如空翻）施加基于模型的虚拟辅助力矩，并随性能提升自动衰减，稳定了训练，无需手工设计课程。\n        *   **跨平台验证**：**同一套方法**在**全尺寸人形Atlas**、**小型人形Unitree G1**和**四足Spot**上均验证成功，展示了前所未有的**跨形态通用性**。特别是在Atlas上实现了**首个动态多接触行为**（如陆军爬行、霹雳舞），在G1上实现了**首个从视频到复杂动态技能**（如跳舞、爬箱）的迁移。\n\n### 方向三：从“特定形态控制”到“通用运动表示与接口”\n\n这个方向关注**控制策略与机器人形态、任务指令之间的解耦**。\n\n1.  **形态特定的控制器**\n    *   **早期大多数工作**：控制器和策略通常为**特定机器人平台（甚至特定行为）** 量身定制，调整参数和奖励结构无法直接迁移。\n\n2.  **运动重定向与通用接口**\n    *   **代表工作**：`DOC`（将运动重定向到腿式机器人）、`OmniH2O`（姿态作为接口）、`MaskedMimic`（掩码运动修复作为通用控制接口）。\n    *   **改进**：探索将**运动学信息**作为一种与底层控制器解耦的**通用接口**。允许高级规划或用户指令（如关键帧、语言）生成运动目标，由底层通用跟踪器执行。\n    *   **局限**：如何设计一个**既通用又高性能、且能处理复杂物理交互**的底层跟踪器，仍然是一个挑战。\n\n3.  **ZEST的贡献 (本工作)**\n    *   **改进与整合**：ZEST本身是一个强大的**底层通用运动跟踪器**，为构建更高级的通用接口奠定了基础。\n        *   **作为理想的“执行层”**：ZEST证明了，一个训练良好的策略可以**仅凭下一时刻的参考状态和当前本体感知**，鲁棒地跟踪来自任何来源的复杂运动。这使其非常适合作为**分层架构中的底层执行器**。\n        *   **为未来接口铺路**：论文在讨论中指出，未来方向包括将ZEST与**紧凑运动嵌入**、**稀疏人类可解释输入**（关键帧、语言指令）以及**高级生成式规划器**结合。ZEST的成功意味着，只要高级模块能产生合理的运动参考，它就能可靠地执行，从而**闭环行为合成与控制**。\n\n### 总结与发展脉络图\n\n```\n发展主线：控制范式演进 + Sim-to-Real实践 + 接口通用化\n|\n|-- [范式] 模型基离线规划+在线跟踪 (Atlas经典控制)\n|   |-- 优点：可解释，通用\n|   `-- 瓶颈：依赖精确模型，难以处理复杂接触/不确定性\n|\n|-- [范式] 数据驱动RL (四足跑酷、灵巧手",

            "answer": "## ZEST 论文分析：与前作的对比及主要改进\n\nZEST 建立在作者团队及领域内一系列前期工作的基础上，其核心创新在于**整合、简化并泛化**了从异构数据源到机器人硬件零样本部署的运动模仿流程。以下表格详细梳理了其关键前作，并重点对比了 ZEST 的具体改进。\n\n### 前作梳理与对比分析\n\n| 前作名称 / 类别 | 核心方法 / 贡献 | 与 ZEST 的主要区别 | ZEST 的主要改进 / 具体改动 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **DeepMimic (Peng et al., 2018)** | **开创性工作**：在计算机图形学中，使用 MoCap 数据作为先验，通过单一奖励结构训练策略模仿运动片段，引导策略产生自然运动。 | 1. **领域**：专注于模拟角色控制，未涉及真实机器人部署。<br>2. **数据源**：仅使用高质量 MoCap。<br>3. **训练**：采用均匀的参考状态初始化（RSI），未针对长序列或难样本优化。 | 1. **跨领域到真实机器人**：将模仿学习框架系统性地应用于 Atlas、G1、Spot 等多款真实机器人，并实现**零样本硬件部署**。<br>2. **数据源泛化**：处理 **MoCap、ViCap（单目视频）、动画** 三种异构且质量不一的数据源，证明了框架对数据噪声和物理不可行性的鲁棒性。<br>3. **自适应采样**：引入**基于分段的失败水平评估和分类采样器**，主动将训练重心集中在难以学习的运动片段上，解决了长时程技能学习中的样本效率问题。 |\n| **AMP / ASE (Peng et al., 2021, 2022)** | **对抗模仿学习**：用判别器替代直接模仿奖励，通过匹配示范数据的状态转移分布来鼓励自然运动风格。引入了技能嵌入以提高可重用性和可控性。 | 1. **奖励机制**：依赖对抗训练，需要训练额外的判别器网络，增加了复杂度。<br>2. **部署焦点**：主要目标是在模拟中生成多样、风格化的运动，对 sim-to-real 的挑战（如执行器极限、状态估计）考虑较少。 | 1. **简化的奖励设计**：摒弃了对抗性奖励，回归使用**单一的、通用的、基于指数的跟踪奖励函数**。该奖励不依赖接触标签，避免了对抗训练的不稳定性和模式崩溃问题，使训练流程更稳定、易复现。<br>2. **面向硬件的设计**：策略观测**仅包含本体感知和下一时刻参考**，无需状态估计器或观测历史窗口。动作输出为**残差关节目标**，降低了学习难度，并利用调谐的 PD 控制器保证基础稳定性。 |\n| **VideoMimic (Allshire et al., 2025)** | **视频到行为**：通过“真实-模拟-真实”流程，利用日常视频训练全身策略执行上下文技能。 | 1. **技能复杂度**：主要关注**类 locomotion 的行为**（如走路、搬东西）。<br>2. **流程**：可能涉及多阶段或特定于任务的组件。 | 1. **技能复杂度提升**：实现了从视频到**动态、多接触、场景交互技能**的零样本转移，例如 **G1 机器人的盒子攀爬**。这涉及间歇性全身接触和与环境的强交互，远比单纯 locomotion 复杂。<br>2. **流程统一与简化**：提出了一个**统一的、单阶段的训练流程**，避免了 VideoMimic 可能需要的复杂多阶段 pipeline 或针对视频数据的特殊处理模块。 |\n| **ASAP (He et al., 2025a)** | **模拟与物理对齐**：通过从人类视频预训练运动跟踪策略，在硬件上收集轨迹，并学习一个“增量动作”模型来减小 sim-to-real 差距。 | 1. **方法**：采用**两阶段**方法：先模仿，再通过真实数据微调一个动力学模型。<br>2. **依赖**：需要在实际机器人上收集数据来弥合差距。 | 1. **端到端零样本**：**完全在仿真中训练**，仅使用适度的域随机化，然后直接零样本部署。无需在真实机器人上收集任何交互数据或训练额外的补偿模型。<br>2. **自动课程学习**：引入了**基于模型的辅助力矩自动课程**。该虚拟力矩作用于机器人躯干，其大小根据分段难度自动调整并衰减，稳定了高动态动作（如空翻）的训练，替代了手工设计的课程。 |\n| **GMT (Chen et al., 2025)** | **通用运动跟踪**：结合自适应采样和混合专家（MoE）教师模型，提炼出能跟踪广泛运动的学生策略。 | 1. **架构**：采用**教师-学生蒸馏**框架，结构相对复杂。<br>2. **泛化**：专注于在已见运动上的跟踪性能。 | 1. **极简架构**：策略是一个简单的**前馈神经网络**，输入仅为当前本体感知和下一参考状态。去除了复杂的 MoE 教师、蒸馏过程和历史观测窗口。<br>2. **建模改进**：提供了针对**并联连杆执行器（PLA）** 的渐进式简化建模方法，并从近似解析的臂值中推导出关节级 PD 增益，这显著提升了仿真建模精度，是零样本转移成功的关键基础。 |\n| **Opt-Mimic / DTC (Fuchioka et al., 2023; Jenelten et al., 2024)** | **模仿优化轨迹**：训练策略来模仿基于模型优化器生成的轨迹，结合了优化的精确性和RL的鲁棒性。 | 1. **参考来源**：依赖**模型优化器**生成参考轨迹，这本身是一个计算密集型且需要接触规划的过程。<br>2. **灵活性**：参考轨迹是确定性的，策略对新情况的泛化能力可能受限。 | 1. **数据源无关**：直接从**人类或动画数据**学习，完全绕过复杂的轨迹优化和接触规划步骤。这大大降低了获取多样化技能数据的门槛。<br>2. **免除接触标签**：ZEST 的奖励函数不依赖于参考运动中的任何接触标签，使其能够自然地处理手、膝、躯干等多体接触，而基于优化的方法通常需要预定义接触序列。 |\n\n### 总结：ZEST 的核心创新与改进\n\nZEST 并非从零开始发明新技术，而是通过**战略性整合与系统性简化**，实现了性能与通用性的飞跃：\n\n1.  **统一的异构数据接口**：首次在**同一框架内**无缝处理高保真 MoCap、带噪声的 ViCap 和物理不可行的动画数据，并将它们零样本转移到**不同形态**（人形 Atlas/G1、四足 Spot）的机器人上。\n2.  **极简且鲁棒的训练配方**：\n    - **移除复杂组件**：明确避免了接触标签、未来参考窗口、观测历史、状态估计器、多阶段训练和精细的奖励塑形。\n    - **核心增强技术**：保留了两个高效组件——**自适应分段采样**和**自动辅助力矩课程**——并使其自动化、通用化。\n3.  **面向硬件的建模与设计**：\n    - **改进的 PLA 建模**：提供了从精确到实用的渐进式执行器模型，为仿真保真度打下基础。\n    - **基于模型的增益调谐**：从执行器臂值推导 PD 增益，减少了 sim-to-real 的控制器参数差距。\n    - **最小化观测**：策略仅需当前本体感和下一目标，最大化部署可行性和鲁棒性。\n4.  **实证能力的突破**：\n    - 在 **Atlas** 上实现了首个**动态多接触技能**（如陆军爬行、霹雳舞）。\n    - 在 **G1** 上实现了首个从**视频到复杂场景交互技能**（如盒子攀爬）的零样本转移。\n    - 在 **Spot** 上实现了从动画到高动态技能（如连续后空翻）的跨形态转移。\n\n**总而言之，ZEST 的核心价值在于将运动模仿从一项需要大量领域专业知识、针对特定机器人和数据源进行精心调优的“手艺”，转变为一个标准化、可扩展、高性能的“流水线”，极大地降低了将生物运动转化为机器人鲁棒技能的壁垒。**",

            "answer": "## ZEST论文评价指标与数据集分析\n\n### 一、 评价指标\n\n论文在硬件实验和仿真实验中使用了多种量化指标来评估策略的跟踪性能和鲁棒性。具体指标如下表所示：\n\n| 指标名称 | 符号表示 | 计算方式 | 物理意义 | 评估场景 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **关节位置平均绝对误差** | MAE(𝒒) | $\\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\|\\bm{q}_t - \\hat{\\bm{q}}_t\\|_1$ | 衡量策略输出关节角度与参考轨迹关节角度的平均偏差。值越小，关节跟踪越精确。 | 硬件实验 (表1) |\n| **基座姿态平均角距离** | MAD(R) | $\\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\text{dist}(\\bm{R}_t, \\hat{\\bm{R}}_t)$，其中dist为旋转矩阵间的测地距离（如轴角表示的模长）。 | 衡量机器人基座（躯干）的实际朝向与参考朝向之间的平均角度误差。排除偏航角（yaw），因其在IMU上存在显著漂移。 | 硬件实验 (表1) |\n| **基座角速度平均L2误差** | ML2(𝝎) | $\\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\|\\bm{\\omega}_t - \\hat{\\bm{\\omega}}_t\\|_2$ | 衡量基座实际角速度与参考角速度之间的平均欧氏距离误差。 | 硬件实验 (表1) |\n| **关节位置最大误差** | max(𝒒) | $\\max_{t} \\|\\bm{q}_t - \\hat{\\bm{q}}_t\\|_\\infty$ | 整个运动过程中，关节角度偏离参考值的最大瞬时误差。反映极端情况下的跟踪性能。 | 硬件实验 (表1) |\n| **基座姿态最大误差** | max(R) | $\\max_{t} \\text{dist}(\\bm{R}_t, \\hat{\\bm{R}}_t)$ | 整个运动过程中，基座姿态偏离参考值的最大瞬时角度误差。 | 硬件实验 (表1) |\n| **成功率** | Success Rate | 在大量随机化 rollout 中，成功完成整个参考轨迹的比率。成功定义为未触发早期终止条件（如摔倒、严重偏离）。 | 综合衡量策略在存在干扰和模型不确定性下的鲁棒性和泛化能力。 | 仿真消融实验 (图3e-f) |\n| **性能分位数 (p10, 最小值)** | p10, Min | 在多次实验或不同随机种子下，成功率的第10个百分位数和最小值。 | 评估策略的**最差情况性能**和**鲁棒性下限**，比平均成功率更能反映可靠性。 | 仿真消融实验 (图3e-f) |\n\n**指标使用细节：**\n1.  **硬件实验（表1）**：对每个技能进行多次独立试验，报告上述误差指标的均值。同时标注技能是否为**多接触**（即除脚外，手、膝、躯干等部位是否与地面接触）。\n2.  **仿真实验**：\n    *   **消融研究（图3）**：主要使用**成功率**，并辅以**p10**和**最小值**，以证明自适应采样和辅助力矩课程学习的有效性。\n    *   **与MPC对比（表2）**：使用与硬件实验相同的 **MAE(𝒒)** 和 **MAD(R)**，在仿真环境中公平比较RL策略与基于模型的MPC控制器的跟踪精度。\n3.  **指标选择逻辑**：选择这些指标是因为它们直接反映了运动模仿的核心目标——**精确跟踪参考运动**。同时，通过分析多接触技能与纯足式技能之间的误差差异（例如，前滚翻的MAD(R)误差远大于步行），可以验证框架处理复杂接触动态的能力。\n\n### 二、 数据集（参考运动来源）\n\nZEST框架的核心优势之一是能够从**异构数据源**中学习。论文使用了三类数据源，其细节和处理流程如下：\n\n| 数据源类型 | 简称 | 获取方式 | 特点与挑战 | 论文中应用的技能示例 (机器人平台) | 后处理关键步骤 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **运动捕捉数据** | MoCap | 使用Xsens（惯性）和Vicon（光学）系统采集真人运动。 | **高保真、自然**，包含丰富的人类运动细微特征。是质量最高的数据源。 | 陆军爬行、滚地、霹雳舞、前滚翻、侧手翻（Atlas）；乒乓球、侧手翻（G1） | 1. **运动重定向**：通过时空优化，将源骨骼运动映射到目标机器人骨骼，优化目标包括跟踪根轨迹、对齐骨骼、正则化关节速度。<br>2. **物理一致性调整**：联合优化统一缩放因子和时间重采样，确保弹道运动符合真实重力。 |\n| **视频捕捉数据** | ViCap | 使用手机等单目摄像头录制视频，通过计算机视觉算法重建3D人体运动。 | **便捷、数据量大**，但**噪声大**，存在姿态抖动、脚部滑动等伪影。 | 舞蹈片段、足球踢（Atlas）；芭蕾序列、跳上/爬上/爬下箱子（G1） | 1. **运动重建**：结合 **MegaSaM**（恢复相机轨迹与场景）和 **TRAM**（估计SMPL人体姿态），显著减少了角色漂移和滑动伪影。<br>2. **缩放与重定向**：将SMPL模型统一缩放到机器人尺寸，然后进行与MoCap类似的运动重定向。**不依赖接触标签**。 |\n| **关键帧动画数据** | Animation | 人工制作或算法生成，针对目标机器人形态设计。 | **运动学干净、时序连贯**，但可能**动态不可行**（超出机器人物理极限）。可用于创造非人类运动。 | 手倒立翻转（Atlas）；手倒立平衡、连续后空翻、桶滚、快乐小狗（Spot） | **通常无需重定向**，因为动画是直接针对目标机器人骨架制作的。主要挑战在于让策略学会放松跟踪不可行的部分（如过快的角速度），以保持稳定性。 |\n\n**数据集使用细节与流程：**\n1.  **统一处理流程**：无论数据源如何，最终都转化为机器人关节空间的时间序列参考轨迹 `{𝒒̂_j(t), 𝒗̂_IB(t), 𝝎̂_IB(t), ...}`。\n2.  **核心特点**：ZEST**不依赖任何接触标签**。策略必须从运动学数据中自行推断接触时序和模式，这大大简化了数据准备流程并增强了泛化能力。\n3.  **数据到部署的快速闭环**：特别是ViCap流程，实现了“**上午录制 -> 白天训练 -> 晚上硬件执行**”的快速迭代，展示了该框架的实用性和高效性。\n4.  **多平台适用性**：同一套数据处理和训练方法适用于Atlas、G1和Spot这三个形态、尺寸、重量迥异的机器人，证明了方法的通用性。\n\n### 总结\nZEST论文通过一套**精心设计的定量指标**（聚焦跟踪误差和鲁棒性）和**多元化的参考运动数据集**（覆盖高保真、噪声和虚拟数据），全面、客观地评估了其框架的性能。实验结果不仅展示了在各项指标上的优异表现，更重要的是验证了其**处理异构、不完美数据并实现零次模拟到真实转移**的核心创新点。表格中展示的具体技能和误差值为这些结论提供了坚实的实证支持。",

            "answer": "## 论文实验数据集、评估指标与性能分析\n\n### 一、 实验数据集\n论文在**三种异构数据源**上进行了广泛的实验，涵盖了从高精度到日常视频的多种运动数据：\n\n1.  **运动捕捉数据**\n    *   **来源**：使用 Xsens 和 Vicon 系统采集。\n    *   **特点**：高保真度、自然的人类运动数据，仅需最小化后处理。\n    *   **示例技能**：行走、慢跑、前滚翻、四足滚动、四足爬行、匍匐前进、侧手翻、霹雳舞片段、乒乓球挥拍。\n\n2.  **视频捕捉数据**\n    *   **来源**：使用手持手机等单目摄像头在自然场景下录制，通过 `MegaSaM`（相机与场景估计）和 `TRAM`（人体姿态估计）进行3D运动重建。\n    *   **特点**：数据易得，但存在姿态抖动、脚部滑动等噪声和伪影。\n    *   **示例技能**：足球踢球、舞蹈片段（A-C）、芭蕾序列、跳上/爬上/爬下箱子。\n\n3.  **关键帧动画数据**\n    *   **来源**：人工制作。\n    *   **特点**：运动学上干净、时序连贯，但可能不符合物理约束（如动力学不可行）。\n    *   **用途**：生成人类无法完成的动作（如利用机器人连续关节）或为非人形形态（如四足机器人）设计动作。\n    *   **示例技能**：倒立翻转、倒立平衡、连续后空翻、桶滚、“快乐小狗”动作。\n\n### 二、 主要评估指标\n论文采用了一套**定量与定性相结合**的评估体系，核心定量指标如下：\n\n| 指标 | 全称 | 含义 | 评估对象 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **MAE(𝒒)** | 平均绝对误差 | 关节位置跟踪误差（弧度） | 运动跟踪精度 |\n| **MAD(R)** | 平均角距离 | 基座（躯干）方向跟踪误差（弧度） | 身体姿态稳定性 |\n| **ML2(𝝎)** | 平均L2误差 | 基座角速度跟踪误差 (rad/s) | 动态运动平滑性 |\n| **max(𝒒)** | 最大关节位置误差 | 单次试验中关节位置的最大偏差（弧度） | 极端情况下的跟踪鲁棒性 |\n| **max(R)** | 最大方向误差 | 单次试验中基座方向的最大偏差（弧度） | 极端姿态下的稳定性 |\n\n**注**：\n*   所有指标均在**硬件成功试验**上计算，**值越低表示性能越好**。\n*   基座方向误差仅计算横滚和俯仰，排除了因IMU漂移而难以直接观测的偏航角。\n*   论文还通过**成功率**（在随机化仿真中完成整个动作序列的比率）进行了大规模的仿真消融实验。\n\n### 三、 性能提升与核心成果\nZEST框架的性能提升主要体现在其**泛化能力、鲁棒性和简化流程**上，而非针对单一指标的绝对提升。其主要成果对比如下：\n\n| 对比维度 | ZEST 的表现 | 传统或基线方法的局限 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **数据源泛化** | **统一框架**处理MoCap、ViCap、Animation三种质量不一的数据，均能实现零样本硬件部署。 | 通常需要为不同数据源设计特定管道，对高噪声视频数据鲁棒性差。 |\n| **跨平台泛化** | 同一套方法和超参数应用于**Atlas人形机器人、Unitree G1人形机器人、Spot四足机器人**。 | 控制器通常与特定机器人平台或形态紧密耦合，迁移成本高。 |\n| **技能复杂度** | 实现了**全尺寸人形机器人（Atlas）上首次动态多接触技能**（如匍匐前进、霹雳舞），以及**从视频到人形机器人（G1）的首次动态技能迁移**（如跳舞、爬箱）。 | 传统模型预测控制等方法难以处理膝、肘、躯干等多点接触，依赖精确的接触时序标注，对模型误差敏感。 |\n| **流程简化** | **避免使用**：接触标签、冗长的参考/观测窗口、外部状态估计器、复杂的奖励函数工程、多阶段训练。**策略网络仅为简单的前馈MLP**。 | 现有方法通常依赖上述一个或多个复杂组件，增加了调试和部署的复杂性。 |\n| **仿真到现实转移** | 在**中等程度的域随机化**下训练，策略能够**零样本**部署到物理硬件，表现出对模型误差和扰动的鲁棒性。 | 对于接触丰富、接近驱动极限的动态技能，仿真到现实的差距通常很大，需要额外的微调或自适应策略。 |\n| **与MPC基线对比** | 在仿真对比中，对于动态行为（如侧手翻、慢跑），ZEST的RL策略在关节跟踪误差上表现**优于或持平**MPC。MPC在需要膝/躯干接触或接触时序不清晰的动作上**失败**。 | MPC虽然对行走等简单、接触清晰的动作表现良好，但其性能严重依赖精确的接触时序标注和建模，无法处理任意身体部位的接触。 |\n\n**关键性能数据示例（来自论文表1）**:\n*   **Atlas 行走**: MAE(𝒒) = 0.057 rad, MAD(R) = 0.030 rad。\n*   **Atlas 匍匐前进**: MAE(𝒒) = 0.103 rad, MAD(R) = 0.075 rad （尽管是多接触复杂技能，误差仍在可控范围）。\n*   **G1 爬箱**: MAE(𝒒) = 0.073-0.108 rad， 在初始位置、箱子高度、机器人质量变化下仍能成功执行，展示了**卓越的鲁棒性**。\n\n### 总结\nZEST的核心性能提升在于**建立了一个极其简化却异常强大的通用管道**，能够将多种不完美的运动数据源，直接转化为可在多种机器人平台上零样本执行的、鲁棒的全身控制策略。它突破了传统方法在**处理复杂多接触技能**和**依赖繁琐手工模块**方面的瓶颈，为实现敏捷、拟人的机器人技能库提供了一种可扩展的解决方案。",

            "question": "论文的主要局限性有哪些？未来可能的改进方向是什么？",
            "answer": "## 论文主要局限性分析\n\n根据论文“DISCUSSION”和“MATERIALS AND METHODS”等章节的论述，ZEST框架目前存在以下主要局限性：\n\n### 1. **泛化能力未经验证**\n   - **问题**：论文明确指出，**未评估多技能策略对训练集外新动作的泛化能力**。当前策略是针对特定技能进行专门训练的（每个实验使用一个专门策略）。虽然训练了一个多技能策略用于仿真分析，但并未在硬件上部署，也未测试其能否执行与训练动作相似但不同的新技能。\n   - **影响**：这引发了一个关键问题：策略是学习到了可迁移的通用控制基元，还是仅仅过拟合到了具体的参考轨迹。这限制了其作为“通用接口”的宣称。\n\n### 2. **感知与环境交互的局限性**\n   - **假设**：当前框架是**纯本体感知的**，假设地面平坦且不滑。\n   - **问题**：缺乏对**不平坦、柔软或动态环境**的显式感知能力。对于需要在复杂、非结构化环境中进行场景交互的任务（如论文中展示的爬箱子），策略依赖于训练时的随机化来应对初始位姿变化，而非实时的环境感知。\n   - **影响**：这限制了机器人在真实世界复杂环境（如野外、有障碍物的室内）中的实际应用。\n\n### 3. **仿真到现实的依赖性与系统辨识挑战**\n   - **问题**：零样本迁移的成功**高度依赖于合理的仿真建模**。论文虽然提出了并联连杆驱动器（PLA）的渐进简化模型和基于标称电枢值选择PD增益的实用流程，但指出**完全自动化的系统辨识仍然是一个开放性问题**。\n   - **具体挑战**：难以用第一性原理模型捕获的**复杂物理现象**（如复杂的摩擦、接触柔顺性、执行器非线性动力学）可能仍需数据驱动的方法来解决。不准确的建模会扩大“仿真到现实”的差距。\n\n### 4. **策略的专业化与扩展性矛盾**\n   - **问题**：为了在固定时间预算内获得最佳跟踪性能，硬件部署采用了**为每个目标技能训练专用策略**的方案，而非使用单一的多技能通用策略。\n   - **影响**：这在一定程度上与“统一、通用”的目标相悖，增加了管理大量技能策略的复杂性，并且可能无法利用技能间的共性。\n\n---\n\n## 未来可能的改进方向\n\n论文在“DISCUSSION”末尾明确规划了未来的研究方向，主要包括：\n\n### 1. **提升泛化与扩展性**\n   - **目标**：实现对**未见动作的通用跟踪**。\n   - **方法**：\n     - 使用**紧凑的运动嵌入**或**零样本/少样本自适应**技术。\n     - 结合**持续学习策略**，以便在不发生灾难性遗忘的情况下扩展动作库。\n\n### 2. **开发更高级、更灵活的交互接口**\n   - **目标**：超越完全参考轨迹控制，转向**部分条件化的接口**。\n   - **方法**：\n     - **师生蒸馏**：先训练一个能跟踪大型动作库的“教师”策略（使用完整参考），然后将知识蒸馏到一个接受**稀疏、人类可解释输入**的“学生”策略中。\n     - **输入形式**：关键帧、短姿势片段、物体和场景关键帧，或**语言指令**。这借鉴了物理角色控制中的**掩码条件范式**。\n\n### 3. **集成高层生成式规划器**\n   - **目标**：在行为合成与控制之间形成闭环。\n   - **方法**：探索能够将用户命令映射为运动计划的**高层生成式规划器**（如扩散模型），然后由通用的、基于RL的跟踪器来执行。这将实现更自主、更灵活的机器人行为生成。\n\n### 4. **增强环境感知与适应性**\n   - **隐含方向**：虽然未在“未来工作”中明确列出，但基于其感知局限性，自然的延伸是**集成视觉或其他外感知传感器**，使策略能够感知和理解非平坦地形、移动障碍物和未知物体，从而在更广泛的环境中可靠运行。\n\n### 5. **深化仿真建模与系统辨识**\n   - **隐含方向**：继续推进数据驱动的仿真建模方法，以更自动化和精准地捕获机器人硬件的复杂动力学，进一步缩小仿真到现实的差距。\n\n**总结**：ZEST在零样本运动模仿迁移方面取得了显著突破，但其当前形式在**泛化性、环境感知的自主性以及技能管理的可扩展性**方面存在局限。未来的工作将重点围绕**学习通用表征、开发高级人机交互接口、以及结合生成式规划**来构建一个更强大、更智能的机器人运动控制系统。",
