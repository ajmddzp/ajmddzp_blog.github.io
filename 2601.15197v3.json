    "abstract": "视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型在机器人操作任务中展现出潜力，但常难以泛化至新指令或复杂多任务场景。我们发现在当前训练范式中存在一个关键缺陷：目标驱动的数据收集会导致数据集偏差。在此类数据集中，仅凭视觉观察即可高度预测语言指令，导致指令与动作之间的条件互信息趋近于零，我们将此现象称为信息坍缩。其结果是模型退化为仅依赖视觉的策略，忽略语言约束并在分布外（OOD）场景中失效。\n\n为解决这一问题，我们提出LangForce框架，该框架通过贝叶斯分解强制实现指令跟随。通过引入可学习的潜在动作查询，我们构建了双分支架构，分别估计仅基于视觉的先验分布$p(a \\mid v)$和语言条件的后验分布$π(a \\mid v, \\ell)$。随后通过最大化动作与指令间的条件点互信息（PMI）来优化策略。该目标函数能有效抑制视觉捷径依赖，并对显式解释语言指令的动作给予奖励。\n\n无需额外数据，LangForce显著提升了泛化能力。在SimplerEnv和RoboCasa平台上的大量实验证明了其显著优势，其中在具有挑战性的OOD SimplerEnv基准测试中实现了11.3%的性能提升，验证了本方法在动作中鲁棒地锚定语言的能力。",

This limitation is especially pronounced during post-training, where fine-tuning on narrow, task-specific datasets can lead to catastrophic forgetting of the VLM’s general capabilities and impair its ability to generalize to new tasks.\nWe hypothesize that this fragility is exacerbated by a prevalent bias in current robotic datasets.\nMost robotic datasets are collected in a goal-driven manner, where a human operator performs a specific task repeatedly in a fixed scene. In such datasets, the mapping from visual scene\nv\nv\nto language instruction\nℓ\n\\ell\nis nearly injective: seeing a cabinet in the scene almost invariably implies the task “open the cabinet,” while seeing a bottle implies “pick up the bottle.” This deterministic coupling results in a sharp conditional distribution\np\n​\n(\nℓ\n∣\nv\n)\np(\\ell\\mid v)\n.\nFrom a Bayesian perspective, the optimal policy can be decomposed as:\nπ\n​\n(\na\n∣\nv\n,\nℓ\n)\n=\np\n​\n(\nℓ\n∣\na\n,\nv\n)\n​\np\n​\n(\na\n∣\nv\n)\np\n​\n(\nℓ\n∣\nv\n)\n.\n\\pi(a\\mid v,\\ell)=\\frac{p(\\ell\\mid a,v)\\,p(a\\mid v)}{p(\\ell\\mid v)}.\n(1)\nHere,\np\n​\n(\na\n∣\nv\n)\np(a\\mid v)\nrepresents a vision-only prior (i.e., what actions are likely in this scene?), and\np\n​\n(\nℓ\n∣\na\n,\nv\n)\np(\\ell\\mid a,v)\nis the likelihood (i.e., how well does action\na\na\nexplain instruction\nℓ\n\\ell\n?).\nWhen\np\n​\n(\nℓ\n∣\nv\n)\np(\\ell\\mid v)\nis sharp, the model can predict\nℓ\n\\ell\nsolely from\nv\nv\nwithout attending to\na\na\n.\nConsequently, the likelihood term\np\n​\n(\nℓ\n∣\na\n,\nv\n)\np(\\ell\\mid a,v)\ncollapses to\np\n​\n(\nℓ\n∣\nv\n)\np(\\ell\\mid v)\n, and the posterior policy degenerates to the prior:\nπ\n​\n(\na\n∣\nv\n,\nℓ\n)\n≈\np\n​\n(\na\n∣\nv\n)\n.\n\\pi(a\\mid v,\\ell)\\approx p(a\\mid v).\n(2)\nIn other words, the model effectively ignores the language instruction, learning a “vision shortcut” that fails whenever the task is ambiguous or the environment changes.\nTo address this, we propose\nBayesianVLA\n, a novel framework that explicitly enforces instruction following via Bayesian decomposition.\nOur key insight is to maximize the conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) between actions and instructions, which is equivalent to maximizing the log-likelihood ratio (LLR):\nlog\n⁡\np\n​\n(\nℓ\n∣\na\n,\nv\n)\n−\nlog\n⁡\np\n​\n(\nℓ\n∣\nv\n)\n\\log p(\\ell\\mid a,v)-\\log p(\\ell\\mid v)\n.\nThis objective penalizes the vision shortcut by requiring the action\na\na\nto provide\nadditional\ninformation about\nℓ\n\\ell\nthat cannot be inferred from\nv\nv\nalone.\nWe instantiate this framework by introducing\nLatent Action Queries\n—a set of learnable tokens injected into the VLM.\nThese queries serve a dual purpose: they act as a bottleneck to extract action-relevant features for a downstream Diffusion Transformer (DiT) policy, and they enable a dual-branch training strategy.\nIn the\nPriori Branch\n, queries attend only to vision to learn\np\n​\n(\na\n∣\nv\n)\np(a\\mid v)\n; in the\nPosteriori Branch\n, they attend to both vision and language to learn\nπ\n​\n(\na\n∣\nv\n,\nℓ\n)\n\\pi(a\\mid v,\\ell)\n. By optimizing the LLR between these branches,\nBayesianVLA\nlearns to ground language robustly without requiring new data.\nOur contributions are three-fold:\n1.\nWe identify and empirically validate the “vision shortcut” pathology in current VLA training, showing that standard models often ignore language in favor of dataset-specific visual correlations.\n2.\nWe propose\nBayesianVLA\n, a method that leverages Latent Action Queries and a dual-branch Bayesian objective to recover the true language-conditioned policy from biased data.\n3.\nWe demonstrate that\nBayesianVLA\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on SimplerEnv and RoboCasa, with a remarkable\n11.3%\nimprovement in OOD generalization on SimplerEnv, proving its effectiveness in breaking the vision shortcut.\n2\nMotivation: The Illusion of Instruction Following\nBefore detailing our method, we present empirical evidence to substantiate our hypothesis: that standard VLA models trained on goal-driven datasets often learn a vision-only policy\np\n​\n(\na\n∣\nv\n)\np(a\\mid v)\nrather than a true language-conditioned policy\nπ\n​\n(\na\n∣\nv\n,\nℓ\n)\n\\pi(a\\mid v,\\ell)\n.\nSpecifically, we employ the Qwen3VL-4B-GR00T model from starVLA\n(starVLA,\n2025\n)\nas our representative VLA architecture.\nWe conduct three pilot experiments to reveal this\nillusion of instruction following\n.\nIn all three experiments, we train the model by feeding\nonly\nthe visual observation\nv\nv\n(masking the language instruction\nℓ\n\\ell\n), effectively testing the vision-only prior\np\n​\n(\na\n∣\nv\n)\np(a\\mid v)\n.\n2.1\nExperiment 1: The Vision Shortcut in ID Testing\nWe first train a standard VLA model on a subset of the Humanoid robot tabletop manipulation data from PhysicalAI-Robotics-GR00T-X-Embodiment-Sim\n(Bjorck\net al.\n,\n2025b\n)\nand evaluate on 24 tasks from the RoboCasa benchmark\n(Nasiriany\net al.\n,\n2024\n)\n.\nAveraged across all 24 tasks, the vision-only model achieves a success rate of 44.6%, which is close to the language-conditioned baseline of 47.8%.\nThis small gap reveals that the model can succeed without relying on language instructions, as the training and evaluation scenes and tasks are highly similar, enabling the model to learn a near-deterministic mapping from vision to action. Figure\n1\nprovides a relevant example.\nFigure 1:\nExamples of the vision shortcut in RoboCasa\n(Nasiriany\net al.\n,\n2024\n)\n. Training data exhibits visual diversity but limited task diversity. As a result, the model learns to execute tasks directly based on specific visual cues rather than relying on language instructions.\n2.2\nExperiment 2: Failure in Ambiguous Scenarios\nTo further investigate this behavior, we train a standard VLA model on the LIBERO benchmark\n(Liu\net al.\n,\n2023\n)\n, which contains four subsets: Spatial, Object, Long, and Goal.\nWe train on all four training sets and evaluate on all four test sets.\nThe vision-only model achieves success rates comparable to the full VLA model on three subsets (Spatial: 90.2%, Object: 99.6%, Long: 86.0% in Vision-Only, Spatial: 98.8%, Object: 99.0%, Long: 94.4% in Baseline), where each visual scene corresponds to a single task.\nHowever, on the LIBERO Goal subset, the vision-only success rate plummets to 9.8% (98.0% in Baseline).\nThe key difference is that LIBERO Goal presents inherent ambiguity: multiple valid tasks are associated with the same object configuration during training.\nFor instance, a scene with multiple bowls, a stove, and a drawer could correspond to either “put bowl in drawer” or “put bowl on stove”.\nThis confirms that while the model can exploit vision-action correlations in unambiguous datasets, when multiple tasks share the same visual context, due to a lack of language to resolve ambiguity, the model is dominated by the prior\np\n​\n(\na\n∣\nv\n)\np(a\\mid v)\nlearned from dataset statistics.\nFigure\n2\n(a) illustrates examples where the same visual scene in LIBERO Goal corresponds to multiple distinct tasks.\nFigure 2:\n(a) In LIBERO Goal\n(Liu\net al.\n,\n2023\n)\n, the same scene corresponds to multiple tasks, revealing the ambiguity that vision-only models fail to resolve. (b) Action loss curves on BridgeDataV2\n(Walke\net al.\n,\n2023\n)\nshow that the vision-only model achieves comparable training loss to the full vision-language model, indicating the presence of visual shortcuts even in diverse, in-the-wild datasets.\n2.3\nExperiment 3: Catastrophic Failure in OOD Generalization\nFinally, we test the generalization capability by training on the high-quality BridgeDataV2 dataset\n(Walke\net al.\n,\n2023\n)\n(diverse, in-the-wild scenes) and evaluating on SimplerEnv\n(Li\net al.\n,\n2024c\n)\n(simulation, OOD).\nDuring training on BridgeDataV2, the vision-only model achieves an action loss of 0.13, comparable to the full language-conditioned model’s loss of 0.08 (as shown in Figure\n2\n(b)).\nThis indicates that even in diverse, in-the-wild scenarios, the model can still identify visual shortcuts (e.g., specific lighting or background features mapping to specific actions) to minimize the training objective without truly grounding the language instructions.\nHowever, this reliance on visual shortcuts proves catastrophic for generalization.\nWhen evaluated on SimplerEnv, which presents visually distinct simulation environments, the vision-only baseline achieves near 0% success.\nThis confirms that the low training loss on Bridge was achieved by overfitting to domain-specific visual patterns rather than learning generalizable manipulation skills. Consequently, when these specific visual cues are absent in the OOD environment, the policy fails completely.\n2.4\nTheoretical Insight: Information Collapse\nWe formalize the “vision shortcut” as a collapse of the conditional mutual information (CMI) between instructions and actions. Ideally, a robust VLA policy should maintain high\nI\n​\n(\nℓ\n;\na\n∣\nv\n)\nI(\\ell;a\\mid v)\n, meaning the action choice significantly reduces uncertainty about the instruction.\nHowever, the CMI is bounded by the conditional entropy of the language:\nI\n​\n(\nℓ\n;\na\n∣\nv\n)\n=\nH\n​\n(\nℓ\n∣\nv\n)\n−\nH\n​\n(\nℓ\n∣\na\n,\nv\n)\n≤\nH\n​\n(\nℓ\n∣\nv\n)\n.\nI(\\ell;a\\mid v)=H(\\ell\\mid v)-H(\\ell\\mid a,v)\\leq H(\\ell\\mid v).\n(3)\nIn goal-driven datasets, the deterministic mapping\nv\n→\nℓ\nv\\to\\ell\nimplies\nH\n​\n(\nℓ\n∣\nv\n)\n≈\n0\nH(\\ell\\mid v)\\approx 0\n(Xu\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\n. Consequently,\nI\n​\n(\nℓ\n;\na\n∣\nv\n)\nI(\\ell;a\\mid v)\nis forced to vanish, theoretically preventing the model from learning any dependency between\na\na\nand\nℓ\n\\ell\nbeyond what is already captured by\nv\nv\n.\nTo break this deadlock, we cannot rely on standard likelihood maximization. Instead, we must explicitly intervene to maximize the\ninformation gain\nprovided by the action. This motivates our use of the Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR), which effectively estimates the Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI), rewarding the policy only when it captures the specific semantics of\nℓ\n\\ell\nthat are\nnot\npredictable from\nv\nv\n.\n3\nMethod:\nBayesianVLA\nIn this section, we introduce\nBayesianVLA\n, a framework designed to mitigate the vision shortcut in VLA models. We present the overall framework of\nBayesianVLA\nin Figure\n3\n. We first formalize the problem through a Bayesian lens (Section\n3.1\n), deriving an objective that maximizes the mutual information between actions and instructions.\nWe then present our architecture, which uses\nLatent Action Queries\nto instantiate this decomposition (Section\n3.2\n), and detail our dual-branch training strategy (Section\n3.3\n).\nFigure 3:\nThe framework of\nBayesianVLA\n. The framework employs a dual-branch architecture with shared VLM weights. The Priori Branch (left) processes\n[\nv\n,\n𝒬\n,\nℓ\n]\n[v,\\mathcal{Q},\\ell]\nwith causal masking to learn the vision-only prior\np\n​\n(\na\n∣\nv\n)\np(a\\mid v)\n. The Posteriori Branch (right) processes\n[\nv\n,\nℓ\n,\n𝒬\n]\n[v,\\ell,\\mathcal{Q}]\nto learn the full policy\nπ\n​\n(\na\n∣\nv\n,\nℓ\n)\n\\pi(a\\mid v,\\ell)\n. Latent Action Queries\n𝒬\n\\mathcal{Q}\nserve as a bottleneck interface, and the LLR objective (in Eq.\n7\n) encourages the model to maximize the information between actions and instructions. At inference, only the Posteriori Branch is used, incurring no additional computational overhead.\n3.1\nObjective Formulation\nAs established in Section\n2.4\n, standard VLA training on goal-driven datasets leads to information collapse where\nπ\n​\n(\na\n∣\nv\n,\nℓ\n)\n→\np\n​\n(\na\n∣\nv\n)\n\\pi(a\\mid v,\\ell)\\to p(a\\mid v)\n. To counteract this, we propose to regularize the policy by maximizing the conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) between the action and the instruction.\nThis objective can be formulated as maximizing the Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) between the posterior policy and the vision-only prior:\nℒ\nLLR\n=\nlog\n⁡\nπ\n​\n(\na\n∣\nv\n,\nℓ\n)\np\n​\n(\na\n∣\nv\n)\n=\nlog\n⁡\np\n​\n(\nℓ\n∣\na\n,\nv\n)\n−\nlog\n⁡\np\n​\n(\nℓ\n∣\nv\n)\n.\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{LLR}}=\\log\\frac{\\pi(a\\mid v,\\ell)}{p(a\\mid v)}=\\log p(\\ell\\mid a,v)-\\log p(\\ell\\mid v).\n(4)\nThe detailed derivation is provided in Appendix\nA\n.\nThis formulation requires us to simultaneously model the posterior\nπ\n​\n(\na\n∣\nv\n,\nℓ\n)\n\\pi(a\\mid v,\\ell)\nand the prior\np\n​\n(\na\n∣\nv\n)\np(a\\mid v)\n. In the following sections, we describe how\nBayesianVLA\nefficiently instantiates these two distributions using a shared architecture with Latent Action Queries.\n3.2\nLatent Action Queries\nTo efficiently instantiate the proposed Bayesian decomposition within a unified VLM architecture, we introduce\nLatent Action Queries\n.\nWe extend the VLM vocabulary with\nK\n=\n64\nK=64\nlearnable tokens, denoted as\n𝒬\n=\n{\n<|action_0|>\n,\n…\n,\n<|action_K|>\n}\n\\mathcal{Q}=\\{\\texttt{<|action\\_0|>},\\dots,\\texttt{<|action\\_K|>}\\}\n.\nThese queries function as a dedicated bottleneck interface between the VLM (e.g., Qwen3-VL\n(Bai\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\n) and the continuous action head (a Diffusion Transformer\n(Peebles and Xie,\n2023\n)\n).\nUnlike recent VLA architectures such as\nπ\n0\n\\pi_{0}\n(Black\net al.\n,\n2024\n)\nand GR00T\n(Bjorck\net al.\n,\n2025b\n; GEAR-Team\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\n, which typically feed the hidden states of all input tokens to the action expert, we append\n𝒬\n\\mathcal{Q}\nto the input sequence and exclusively use their corresponding hidden states\n𝐇\n𝒬\n∈\nℝ\nK\n×\nD\n\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathcal{Q}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{K\\times D}\nto condition the action head.\nThis design choice is critical: by leveraging the causal masking inherent in decoder-only VLMs, we can precisely control the information encoded in\n𝐇\n𝒬\n\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathcal{Q}}\nsimply by changing the position of\n𝒬\n\\mathcal{Q}\nin the input sequence. This flexibility enables the strict separation of vision-only and vision-language contexts required for our dual-branch strategy.\n3.3\nDual-Branch Training Framework\nWe propose a training paradigm with two parallel branches sharing the same VLM weights but different input structures.\n1. Priori Branch (Vision-Only).\nTo estimate the prior\np\n​\n(\na\n∣\nv\n)\np(a\\mid v)\n, we construct the input sequence as:\nInput\nprior\n=\n[\nv\n,\n𝒬\n,\nℓ\n]\n.\n\\text{Input}_{\\text{prior}}=[v,\\mathcal{Q},\\ell].\n(5)\nDue to the causal attention mask of the decoder-only VLM, the tokens in\n𝒬\n\\mathcal{Q}\ncan attend to the visual observation\nv\nv\nbut\ncannot\nattend to the language instruction\nℓ\n\\ell\n(which appears later). Thus, the hidden states\n𝐇\n𝒬\nprior\n\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathcal{Q}}^{\\text{prior}}\nencode purely visual information.\nWe use these features to predict the action\na\na\n, optimizing a flow-matching loss\nℒ\nprior\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{prior}}\nto learn the dataset’s inherent action bias.\n2. Posteriori Branch (Vision + Language).\nTo estimate the true policy\nπ\n​\n(\na\n∣\nv\n,\nℓ\n)\n\\pi(a\\mid v,\\ell)\n, we arrange the input as:\nInput\npost\n=\n[\nv\n,\nℓ\n,\n𝒬\n]\n.\n\\text{Input}_{\\text{post}}=[v,\\ell,\\mathcal{Q}].\n(6)\nHere,\n𝒬\n\\mathcal{Q}\nappears after\nℓ\n\\ell\n, allowing it to attend to both vision and language. The resulting hidden states\n𝐇\n𝒬\npost\n\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathcal{Q}}^{\\text{post}}\nencode the full context. We optimize a main flow-matching loss\nℒ\nmain\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{main}}\nto learn the expert action.\n3. Maximizing the Likelihood Ratio.\nIn addition to action prediction, we explicitly optimize the LLR objective. We treat the VLM’s language modeling loss as a proxy for\nlog\n⁡\np\n​\n(\nℓ\n∣\n…\n)\n\\log p(\\ell\\mid\\dots)\n.\nSpecifically, in the Priori Branch, the language tokens\nℓ\n\\ell\nattend to\n[\nv\n,\n𝒬\n]\n[v,\\mathcal{Q}]\n. Since\n𝒬\n\\mathcal{Q}\nencodes the action information\na\na\n(via the prior), the probability of generating\nℓ\n\\ell\nin this branch approximates\np\n​\n(\nℓ\n∣\nv\n,\na\nprior\n)\np(\\ell\\mid v,a_{\\text{prior}})\n.\nIn the Posteriori Branch, we can compute a baseline\np\n​\n(\nℓ\n∣\nv\n)\np(\\ell\\mid v)\nby detaching gradients or using a separate pass.\nHowever, a more direct and numerically stable approach is to maximize the difference in log-probabilities of the language tokens between the two branches.

baselines, achieving a state-of-the-art average success rate of 66.5%.\nNotably, compared to the direct baseline QwenGR00T (55.2%) built on the same StarVLA framework, our method delivers an absolute improvement of 11.3%, validating that the performance gain stems from our proposed Bayesian decomposition rather than the base architecture.\nSignificant improvements are observed in tasks requiring precise object identification and manipulation, such as\n“Put Carrot on Plate”\n(+13.6%) and\n“Put Eggplant in Yellow Basket”\n(+15.0%).\nFurthermore,\nBayesianVLA\nsurpasses other recent strong competitors, including the flow-matching-based\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n(57.1%) and the dual-system Isaac-GR00T-N1.6 (57.1%).\nThese results confirm that by explicitly optimizing the mutual information between language and action,\nBayesianVLA\neffectively mitigates the vision shortcut.\nFundamentally, this validates that our approach prevents the policy from collapsing into a spurious vision-only prior\np\n​\n(\na\n|\nv\n)\np(a|v)\ncaused by dataset determinism, and instead compels the model to learn the true causal dependency of actions on language instructions.\n4.2\nExperiments on RoboCasa\nWe evaluate our method on the RoboCasa GR1 Tabletop Manipulation Benchmark\n(Nasiriany\net al.\n,\n2024\n)\n, which consists of 24 diverse manipulation tasks.\nThese tasks feature complex interactions with articulated objects and varied geometries, exemplified by specific tasks like “PnPBottleToCabinetClose” and “PnPCanToDrawerClose”, as well as scenarios involving appliances like microwaves and toasters.\nFor training, we utilize the Humanoid Robot Tabletop Manipulation subset from the PhysicalAI-Robotics-GR00T-X-Embodiment-Sim\n(Bjorck\net al.\n,\n2025b\n)\ndataset.\nApart from the dataset, all experimental configurations are identical to those detailed in Section\n4.1\n.\nTo guarantee statistical significance, we evaluate each task using 50 independent trials and report the average success rate (Avg@50).\nThe quantitative results on RoboCasa are presented in Table\n2\n.\nConsistent with the empirical evidence presented in our motivation (Section\n2\n), the VisionOnly baseline achieves a surprisingly high success rate of 44.7%, lagging only slightly behind the standard QwenGR00T baseline (47.8%).\nThis observation reconfirms the prevalence of the vision shortcut in this benchmark, suggesting that a significant portion of tasks can be solved by relying solely on visual cues.\nHowever,\nBayesianVLA\nbreaks this performance ceiling, achieving a state-of-the-art average success rate of 50.4% and surpassing all competing baselines, including QwenOFT (48.8%) and Isaac-GR00T (47.6%).\nCrucially, our method demonstrates substantial gains in tasks where the vision-only policy falters.\nFor instance, in the task “PnP Novel From Placemat To Plate”,\nBayesianVLA\nachieves 70.0% success, significantly outperforming both the VisionOnly baseline (34.0%) and the standard QwenGR00T (48.0%).\nThese results indicate that maximizing the LLR objective successfully forces the policy to extract and utilize task-specifying information from language, rather than settling for local optima based on visual shortcuts.\n4.3\nPreservation of General Capabilities\nFigure 4:\nQualitative comparison of general multimodal reasoning.\nWe present a case where the model is asked to solve a mathematical problem. The standard VLA baseline (QwenGR00T) suffers from catastrophic forgetting; while the text before the comma implies “differentiating all terms together”, the subsequent output degenerates into repetitive and meaningless gibberish (bottom right). In contrast,\nBayesianVLA\n(top right) retains the VLM’s original reasoning and language generation capabilities (left), successfully solving the problem.\nA prevalent view is that fine-tuning VLMs for robotic action generation (VLA training) diminishes the model’s foundational reasoning and multimodal understanding, potentially leading to a loss of general conversational abilities\n(Zhou\net al.\n,\n2025\n; Xu\net al.\n,\n2025\n; Hancock\net al.\n,\n2025\n; Yu\net al.\n,\n2026\n)\n.\nChatVLA\n(Zhou\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\nattributes this to two factors:\nspurious forgetting\n, where robot training overwrites crucial visual-text alignments, and\ntask interference\n, where competing control and understanding tasks degrade performance when trained jointly.\nWe observe similar degradation in our baseline: as shown in Figure\n4\n, the standard QwenGR00T model loses its ability to converse coherently even when prompted with pure text inputs.\nIn contrast,\nBayesianVLA\nremarkably preserves these capabilities when queried with language instructions.\nFigure 5:\nAdditional qualitative comparison.\nDemonstrating the preservation of general VLM capabilities on another example.\nIt is crucial to note a nuanced distinction: while\nBayesianVLA\npreserves normal text-only conversational ability, its general vision-language conversation (image + text inputs) can still degrade after VLA training.\nWe hypothesize this is mainly because, in our training setup, the vision tower (and the multimodal fusion/projection layers) must be adapted for control, which can shift visual representations away from the pre-trained vision–language alignment manifold.\nSuch specialization is expected for an embodied agent optimized for action.\nImportantly,\nBayesianVLA\nhelps prevent the\ntext-only language behavior\nof the backbone from collapsing.\nIn the baseline, the vision shortcut can render instruction tokens effectively redundant for control, weakening the training signal that encourages meaningful language processing and increasing drift in shared parameters, which manifests as failures even on pure text queries (Fig.\n4\nand Fig.\n5\n).\nConversely, our method’s LLR objective enforces a strong dependency on language.\nThis acts as a regularizer that maintains the functional utility of instruction tokens, thereby preserving the backbone’s text-only conversational ability even as the visual modality is specialized for control.\nThis preservation is of significant practical value: it ensures that the VLM backbone does not degenerate into a shallow feature mapper.\nBy retaining its linguistic core, the agent preserves the potential for higher-level reasoning and generalization to novel instructions, which are the primary motivations for employing Foundation Models in robotics.\n4.4\nAblation Studies\nWe conduct ablation studies on SimplerEnv to validate the contributions of individual components in\nBayesianVLA\n. All experiments utilize the Qwen3-VL-4B backbone, and results are presented in Table\n3\n.\nEffectiveness of Bayesian Decomposition.\nComparing the full\nBayesianVLA\n(63.5%) with the “+ Action Query” ablation (57.5%), we observe a significant performance boost (+6.0%).\nThis indicates that while the architectural changes provide some benefit, the core improvement stems from our dual-branch Bayesian learning objective.\nBy explicitly modeling and maximizing the pointwise mutual information (PMI) between instructions and actions, the model effectively overcomes the vision shortcut, validating the central hypothesis of this work.\nPotential of Latent Action Queries.\nEven without the dual-branch definition, introducing Latent Action Queries (“QwenGR00T + Action Query”) improves upon the QwenGR00T baseline (55.2%\n→\n\\to\n57.5%).\nThis suggests that Latent Action Queries function as a promising architectural inductive bias.\nUnlike standard approaches that feed full sequences of vision and language token embeddings into the action decoder, our query-based mechanism forces the VLM to compress and summarize task-relevant information into a compact set of latent tokens.\nFrom a computational perspective, this design is highly efficient.\nIt decouples the complexity of the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) from the length of the VLM input context.\nSpecifically, the complexity of condition processing in the DiT is reduced from\nO\n​\n(\nN\n2\n)\nO(N^{2})\n(scaling with the massive number of vision-language tokens\nN\nN\n) to\nO\n​\n(\nK\n2\n)\nO(K^{2})\n(scaling with the small, constant number of query tokens\nK\nK\n), thereby streamlining the action generation process.\nTable 3:\nAblation study on SimplerEnv\n. All experiments are based on the Qwen3-VL-4B backbone. We compare the baseline QwenGR00T, the addition of Latent Action Queries, and the full\nBayesianVLA\nframework to validate the contributions of each component.\nMethod\nPut Spoon\non Towel\nPut Carrot\non Plate\nStack Green Block\non Yellow Block\nPut Eggplant\nin Yellow Basket\nAverage\nQwenGR00T\n(starVLA,\n2025\n)\n87.5\n50.0\n29.2\n54.2\n55.2\nQwenGR00T + Action Query\n74.6\n58.3\n29.2\n67.9\n57.5\nBayesianVLA\n89.6\n63.8\n33.3\n79.2\n66.5\n5\nDiscussion\nBased on our analysis of the vision shortcut and the Bayesian decomposition framework, we discuss several potential insights that may guide future research and community practices.\nRethinking Data Collection Strategies.\nOur experiments suggest that the deterministic mapping from visual scenes to language instructions (\nH\n​\n(\nℓ\n∣\nv\n)\n≈\n0\nH(\\ell\\mid v)\\approx 0\n) in goal-driven datasets is a significant factor contributing to the vision shortcut. To mitigate this, we hypothesize that a shift in data collection strategies could be beneficial. Prioritizing data collection in ambiguous scenarios—where the task cannot be inferred solely from the initial observation—might naturally increase the conditional entropy of language. By enriching datasets with scenes that support multiple valid tasks, models may be forced to rely more heavily on instructions for disambiguation.\nLeveraging Human Data for Robustness.\nRecently, there has been growing interest in training robot models on large-scale human video data, such as HRDT\n(Bi\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\n, In-N-On\n(Cai\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\n, METIS\n(Fu\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\n, and PhysBrain\n(Lin\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\n. Unlike curated robot datasets, human activities are inherently multimodal and context-dependent; the same environment often hosts a wide variety of behaviors, potentially leading to a less sharp\np\n​\n(\nℓ\n∣\nv\n)\np(\\ell\\mid v)\n. We conjecture that injecting action knowledge from such rich human distributions might help mitigate the information collapse observed in robot-only datasets.\nWorld Models as an Alternative Bayesian Formulation.\nBeyond the VLM framework focused on in this work, recent studies have also explored adapting World Models for VLA control, as seen in F1-VLA\n(Lv\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\n, Mantis\n(Yang\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\n, and InternVLA-A1\n(contributors,\n2026\n)\n.\nFrom a theoretical perspective, these approaches can be viewed as an alternative instantiation of the Bayesian rule, specifically performing inverse dynamics on imagined futures. If we consider\nv\nv\nas a sequence of past frames\nv\n≤\nt\nv_{\\leq t}\n, and treat the future state\nv\nt\n+\n1\nv_{t+1}\nas a latent variable generated by the model (conditioned on\nℓ\n\\ell\n), the action inference can be expressed as:\np\n​\n(\na\n∣\nv\n≤\nt\n,\nv\nt\n+\n1\n,\nℓ\n)\n=\np\n​\n(\nv\nt\n+\n1\n∣\nv\n≤\nt\n,\na\n,\nℓ\n)\n​\np\n​\n(\na\n∣\nv\n≤\nt\n,\nℓ\n)\np\n​\n(\nv\nt\n+\n1\n∣\nv\n≤\nt\n,\nℓ\n)\n.\np(a\\mid v_{\\leq t},v_{t+1},\\ell)=\\frac{p(v_{t+1}\\mid v_{\\leq t},a,\\ell)\\,p(a\\mid v_{\\leq t},\\ell)}{p(v_{t+1}\\mid v_{\\leq t},\\ell)}.\n(10)\nHere, the numerator\np\n​\n(\nv\nt\n+\n1\n∣\nv\n≤\nt\n,\na\n,\nℓ\n)\np(v_{t+1}\\mid v_{\\leq t},a,\\ell)\nrepresents a\nworld model\n(forward dynamics) predicting the future state. The term\np\n​\n(\na\n∣\nv\n≤\nt\n,\nℓ\n)\np(a\\mid v_{\\leq t},\\ell)\nserves as an action prior, and the denominator\np\n​\n(\nv\nt\n+\n1\n∣\nv\n≤\nt\n,\nℓ\n)\np(v_{t+1}\\mid v_{\\leq t},\\ell)\nrepresents the future prediction marginalized over actions.\nIn this formulation, the policy execution involves first “imagining” a desired future\nv\nt\n+\n1\nv_{t+1}\nconsistent with\nℓ\n\\ell\n, and then inferring the optimal action\na\na\nvia the equation above.\nSince world models are typically trained on vast amounts of video data, the predictive distribution (the numerator) is often rich and highly sensitive to the action\na\na\n. We hypothesize that this sensitivity prevents the collapse of the numerator to the denominator. This suggests that world model-based architectures could offer another robust technical path toward solving the vision shortcut, which we plan to explore in future work.\n6\nRelated Work\nWe build our work upon the following rigorous foundations:\nVision-Language-Action Dataset and Benchmark.\nThe advancement of generalist robot policies relies heavily on large-scale datasets and rigorous benchmarks.\nLIBERO\n(Liu\net al.\n,\n2023\n)\npioneered the systematic study of knowledge transfer in lifelong robot learning.\nTo scale up real-world data, BridgeData V2\n(Walke\net al.\n,\n2023\n)\nprovided diverse interaction trajectories on low-cost hardware.\nThis effort was expanded by Open X-Embodiment (OXE)\n(O’Neill\net al.\n,\n2024\n)\n, which aggregated data across 22 robot embodiments, and Droid\n(Khazatsky\net al.\n,\n2024\n)\n, which further increased diversity with distributed data collection.\nFor scalable evaluation, RoboCasa\n(Nasiriany\net al.\n,\n2024\n)\nintroduced a large-scale simulation framework with realistic kitchen environments, while SimplerEnv\n(Li\net al.\n,\n2024c\n)\nprovided a simulated evaluation proxy to correlate with real-world performance, addressing the reproducibility crisis in physical evaluation.\nMore recently, RoboTwin 2.0\n(Chen\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\noffered a unified benchmark for bimanual manipulation with automated data generation, and AgiBot-World\n(Bu\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\nscaled training data to over 1 million trajectories with human-in-the-loop verification.\nVision-Language-Action Models.\nTo bridge the gap between semantic understanding and physical control, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a dominant paradigm.\nEarly works like Octo\n(Team\net al.\n,\n2024\n)\nestablished the transformer-based policy as a versatile initialization, utilizing diffusion heads to handle multimodal action distributions.\nBuilding on pre-trained VLMs, OpenVLA\n(Kim\net al.\n,\n2024\n)\nand its optimized variant OpenVLA-OFT\n(Kim\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\nfine-tune large language models for robotic control, demonstrating strong generalization.\nTo further enhance action modeling, specialized architectures have been proposed. CogACT\n(Li\net al.\n,\n2024a\n)\nand RDT-1B\n(Liu\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\nemploy dedicated diffusion transformers to capture complex action dynamics.\nRecent works explore advanced architectures and generation algorithms to better balance reasoning and control. The GR00T series (N1, N1.5, N1.6)\n(Bjorck\net al.\n,\n2025b\n,\na\n; GEAR-Team\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\nutilizes a dual-system design, architecturally coupling a VLM for perception with a diffusion head for action generation.\nIn parallel, the\nπ\n0\n\\pi_{0}\nseries (\nπ\n0\n\\pi_{0}\n,\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n, FAST)\n(Black\net al.\n,\n2024\n,\n2025\n; Pertsch\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\nleverages Flow Matching as a superior generation objective, adopting a two-stage training paradigm that pre-trains the VLM backbone before fine-tuning.\nSpecifically, FAST introduces discrete motion tokens to efficiently encode actions for the VLM, while\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\nincorporates subtask decomposition to enhance long-horizon planning.\nOther approaches like X-VLA\n(Zheng\net al.\n,\n2025a\n)\nintroduce embodiment-specific soft prompts to facilitate cross-embodiment generalization. By learning separate sets of embeddings for each data source, X-VLA effectively leverages heterogeneous robot data with minimal additional parameters.\nSpatialVLA\n(Qu\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\nargues that spatial understanding is central to manipulation, introducing Ego3D Position Encoding and Adaptive Action Grids to inject 3D information and learn transferable spatial action knowledge.\nThen, VideoVLA\n(Shen\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\nexplores transforming video generation models into robot manipulators.\nBy jointly predicting action sequences and future visual outcomes, it leverages the “visual imagination” of generative models to enhance generalization across novel tasks and objects.\nBayesVLA\n(Xu\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\nalso employs Bayesian decomposition to address language diversity limitations in VLA training. Using a CLIP-based encoder and diffusion transformer, it adopts a two-stage framework: the first stage trains a vision-conditioned prior on large-scale vision-action pairs to capture multimodal action distributions, while the second stage freezes the prior and injects language-aware tokens to refine policy conditioning on instructions.\nHowever, BayesVLA does not scale its training to large-scale VLMs, while other VLA approaches lack systematic solutions to the vision shortcut problem, where models ignore language instructions in goal-driven datasets.\n7\nConclusion\nIn this work, we identified a critical pathology in standard VLA training: the\nvision shortcut\n, where models learn to ignore language instructions in goal-driven datasets, leading to a collapse of the mutual information between instructions and actions.\nThis phenomenon results in catastrophic failure when the model faces ambiguous scenarios or out-of-distribution environments where visual shortcuts no longer hold.\nTo address this, we introduced\nBayesianVLA\n, a novel framework that formalizes VLA learning through a Bayesian lens.\nBy decomposing the policy into a vision-only prior and a language-conditioned posterior, we derived a training objective that explicitly maximizes the Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR), effectively optimizing the Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) between language and action.\nWe instantiated this decomposition using a unified architecture with Latent Action Queries and a dual-branch training strategy, which incurs no additional computational overhead during inference.\nOur extensive experiments on SimplerEnv and RoboCasa demonstrate that\nBayesianVLA\neffectively mitigates the vision shortcut problem.\nIt significantly outperforms baselines under various conditions; in out-of-distribution simulation environments, where standard methods fail completely,\nBayesianVLA\nachieves robust generalization.\nThese results highlight the importance of introducing structural inductive biases in learning robust, generalizable robot policies.\nWe hope our work inspires further research into the information-theoretic foundations of embodied AI, pushing towards robots that truly understand and reliably execute human intent.\nLimitation and Future Work\nWhile\nBayesianVLA\noffers significant improvements in robustness, the dual-branch architecture introduces a limitation regarding computational overhead during training.\nSince the model must compute both the Priori and Posteriori branches, the computational cost per iteration theoretically increases.\nHowever, we note that the visual input prefix is identical for both branches, and the number of visual tokens vastly outnumbers that of the language and latent action query tokens.\nBy employing a prefix prefill strategy to compute and reuse the visual representations (e.g., vision encoder outputs) for both branches, the actual increase in training time is marginal.\nThus, the additional computational overhead remains within a completely acceptable range.\nFor future work, we intend to provide a more comprehensive empirical evaluation in subsequent versions of this manuscript.\nWe plan to extend our experimental validation to include the RoboTwin and LIBERO benchmarks, alongside real-world robot experiments.\nWe also aim to scale our framework to larger foundation models, such as conducting experiments with\nBayesianVLA\non Qwen3VL-8B.\nAdditionally, we plan to include more extensive ablation studies to further dissect the contribution of each component and hyperparameter within our Bayesian decomposition framework, thereby rendering the analysis more complete.\nReferences\nS.

    "preview_text": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promise in robot manipulation but often struggle to generalize to new instructions or complex multi-task scenarios. We identify a critical pathology in current training paradigms where goal-driven data collection creates a dataset bias. In such datasets, language instructions are highly predictable from visual observations alone, causing the conditional mutual information between instructions and actions to vanish, a phenomenon we term Information Collapse. Consequently, models degenerate into vision-only policies that ignore language constraints and fail in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. To address this, we propose LangForce, a novel framework that enforces instruction following via Bayesian decomposition. By introducing learnable Latent Action Queries, we construct a dual-branch architecture to estimate both a vision-only prior $p(a \\mid v)$ and a language-conditioned posterior $π(a \\mid v, \\ell)$. We then optimize the policy to maximize the conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) between actions and instructions. This objective effectively penalizes the vision shortcut and rewards actions that explicitly explain the language command. Without requiring new data, LangForce significantly improves generalization. Extensive experiments across on SimplerEnv and RoboCasa demonstrate substantial gains, including an 11.3% improvement on the challenging OOD SimplerEnv benchmark, validating the ability of our approach to robustly ground language in action.\n\nBayesianVLA\n: Bayesian Decomposition of Vision Language Action Models via Latent Action Queries\nShijie Lian\n1,2,\nBin Yu\n2,4,\n1\n1\nfootnotemark:\n1\nXiaopeng Lin\n2,5,\n1\n1\nfootnotemark:\n1\nLaurence T.

            "answer": "## 论文核心分析：BayesianVLA\n\n### **一、 核心问题：视觉捷径与信息坍缩**\n\n当前视觉-语言-动作模型在机器人操作中存在一个根本性缺陷：**模型倾向于忽略语言指令，仅依赖视觉观察来预测动作**。论文将这一现象称为 **“视觉捷径”** ，其根源在于训练数据的 **“信息坍缩”**。\n\n- **问题根源**：主流机器人数据集（如BridgeDataV2, RoboCasa）以目标驱动方式收集。在这种数据集中，**视觉场景 `v` 和语言指令 `ℓ` 之间存在近乎确定性的映射**（例如，看到柜子就对应“打开柜子”）。这导致条件分布 `p(ℓ|v)` 非常尖锐，条件熵 `H(ℓ|v) ≈ 0`。\n- **严重后果**：根据贝叶斯公式，最优策略 `π(a|v,ℓ) = [p(ℓ|a,v) * p(a|v)] / p(ℓ|v)`。当 `p(ℓ|v)` 尖锐时，似然项 `p(ℓ|a,v)` 会坍缩到 `p(ℓ|v)`，使得后验策略退化为视觉先验：`π(a|v,ℓ) ≈ p(a|v)`。**模型实质上变成了一个无视语言的、仅基于视觉的策略**。\n- **实际表现**：在分布内测试时性能尚可，但在**模糊场景**（同一视觉场景对应多个任务）或**分布外**环境（视觉线索变化）中会完全失败。\n\n### **二、 核心创新：贝叶斯分解与潜在动作查询**\n\n论文提出了 **BayesianVLA** 框架，通过贝叶斯分解强制模型遵循指令。其创新点是一个统一的架构与训练目标。\n\n#### **1. 理论创新：最大化条件点互信息**\n- **核心目标**：最大化动作 `a` 和指令 `ℓ` 之间的**条件点互信息**。\n- **实现方式**：优化**对数似然比**：\n  ```math\n  ℒ_LLR = log [π(a|v,ℓ) / p(a|v)] = log p(ℓ|a,v) - log p(ℓ|v)\n  ```\n  该目标惩罚了“视觉捷径”，奖励那些能为指令提供**超出视觉观察之外的额外信息**的动作。\n\n#### **2. 架构创新：潜在动作查询与双分支设计**\n- **潜在动作查询**：在VLM词汇表中引入一组**可学习的令牌** `𝒬`（如64个）。这些查询作为VLM与下游扩散Transformer动作头之间的**瓶颈接口**。\n- **关键设计**：利用解码器VLM的**因果注意力掩码**，通过简单地改变 `𝒬` 在输入序列中的位置，就能精确控制其能访问的信息。\n- **双分支训练框架**：\n  - **先验分支**：输入为 `[v, 𝒬, ℓ]`。由于因果掩码，`𝒬` 只能看到视觉 `v`，从而学习**视觉先验策略 `p(a|v)`**。\n  - **后验分支**：输入为 `[v, ℓ, 𝒬]`。`𝒬` 能看到视觉和语言，从而学习**完整的条件策略 `π(a|v,ℓ)`**。\n- **训练目标**：总损失结合了双分支的动作预测损失和对数似然比最大化项：\n  ```math\n  ℒ_total = (1-λ)ℒ_FM(𝐇_𝒬_post) + λℒ_FM(𝐇_𝒬_prior) - βℒ_LLR\n  ```\n- **推理效率**：**仅使用后验分支**，因此**在测试时不产生任何额外计算开销**。\n\n### **三、 解决方案的价值与效果**\n\n#### **1. 实际价值**\n- **提升泛化能力**：在具有挑战性的OOD基准测试（SimplerEnv）上，相比强基线（QwenGR00T）取得了 **11.3% 的绝对提升**，在RoboCasa上也达到了SOTA水平。\n- **保留通用能力**：与标准VLA训练导致VLM文本对话能力崩溃不同，BayesianVLA的LLR目标作为一种正则化，**保留了骨干VLM的纯文本对话和推理能力**（见图4,5），这对于依赖高级语义理解的机器人至关重要。\n- **无需新数据**：该方法直接从存在偏见的现有数据中恢复出真正的语言条件策略，**不要求收集新的、更平衡的数据集**。\n\n#### **2. 技术贡献总结**\n- **诊断**：首次从信息论角度（条件互信息坍缩）形式化并实证验证了VLA训练中的“视觉捷径”病理。\n- **方法**：提出了一个基于贝叶斯分解和潜在动作查询的**原则性框架**，通过最大化PMI来强制语言 grounding。\n- **验证**：通过大量实验证明该方法能有效打破视觉捷径，在分布外和模糊场景中实现鲁棒泛化，同时保留了模型的核心语言能力。\n\n**总之，BayesianVLA 的核心在于通过一个精巧的、受贝叶斯理论启发的双分支架构和训练目标，迫使VLA模型必须利用语言指令中的信息来决策动作，从而解决了当前训练范式下模型“假装”遵循指令的根本问题。**",

            "answer": "## 论文《LangForce: Bayesian Decomposition of Vision Language Action Models via Latent Action Queries》发展脉络梳理\n\n本文提出的 **BayesianVLA** 是 VLA 模型发展中的一个重要节点，旨在解决“视觉捷径”这一核心病理。其发展脉络可以追溯到多个并行且相互交织的研究方向。以下梳理了从早期数据集构建到最新架构创新的关键步骤，并着重分析了几个主要发展方向。\n\n### 发展脉络总览\n\nVLA 模型的发展遵循“**数据规模化 → 架构通用化 → 专业化与鲁棒性提升**”的路径。早期工作集中于构建大规模、多样化的机器人数据集，为训练通用策略奠定基础。随后，研究重点转向如何将强大的视觉语言模型适配到机器人控制任务中，产生了多种架构范式。近期工作则开始深入解决通用化过程中的具体瓶颈，如跨具身泛化、空间理解、长视野规划，以及本文关注的**指令跟随鲁棒性**问题。\n\n### 关键发展阶段与改进\n\n#### 方向一：**数据集与基准的规模化与多样化**\n这是VLA模型发展的基石，每一步改进都在扩大数据规模、丰富场景和任务多样性，以支持更通用策略的学习。\n\n1.  **LIBERO (2023)**\n    *   **改进**：首次系统化地研究机器人终身学习中的知识迁移问题，提供了结构化的基准来评估模型在新任务、新对象、新目标上的泛化能力。\n    *   **价值**：揭示了任务模糊性（同一场景对应多个任务）对模型泛化的挑战，为后续研究（如本文）提供了关键的诊断工具。\n\n2.  **BridgeData V2 (2023) & Droid (2024)**\n    *   **改进**：从实验室可控环境扩展到“野外”真实世界数据。BridgeData V2 在低成本硬件上收集了多样化的交互轨迹；Droid 进一步通过分布式数据收集极大提升了数据多样性。\n    *   **价值**：提供了大规模、异构的真实机器人数据，使模型能够学习更广泛的操作技能和应对环境变化。\n\n3.  **Open X-Embodiment (OXE) (2024)**\n    *   **改进**：实现了**跨具身**数据集的聚合，整合了22种不同机器人平台的数据。\n    *   **价值**：首次证明可以在不同形态的机器人数据上联合训练，学习通用的“机器人策略”，推动了通用机器人基础模型的发展。\n\n4.  **RoboCasa (2024) & SimplerEnv (2024)**\n    *   **改进**：提供了可扩展、可重复的**仿真评估基准**。RoboCasa 提供复杂的厨房场景；SimplerEnv 则提供了一个与真实世界性能相关的轻量级仿真代理。\n    *   **价值**：解决了机器人物理评估的“可重复性危机”，使算法对比更加公平、高效。\n\n#### 方向二：**VLA 模型架构与训练范式的演进**\n此方向关注如何将预训练VLM的知识有效地“灌输”到控制策略中，并提升动作建模能力。\n\n1.  **Octo (2024) & OpenVLA 系列 (2024-2025)**\n    *   **改进**：确立了基于Transformer的通用策略架构。OpenVLA 直接对大型语言模型进行全参数微调，将其用于机器人控制。\n    *   **价值**：验证了直接利用强大VLM进行端到端策略学习的可行性，但面临计算成本高和灾难性遗忘的问题。OpenVLA-OFT 通过优化器微调等技术提升了训练效率。\n\n2.  **GR00T 系列 (2025) & π₀ 系列 (2024-2025)**\n    *   **GR00T的改进**：采用**双系统设计**，架构上耦合一个用于感知的VLM和一个用于动作生成的扩散头，并进行协同训练。\n    *   **π₀系列的改进**：引入**流匹配**作为更优的生成目标，并采用两阶段训练（先预训练VLM主干，再微调）。π₀.₅ 加入了子任务分解以增强长视野规划能力。\n    *   **价值**：代表了当前高性能VLA的两大主流架构范式，分别从系统设计和训练目标上进行了优化。\n\n3.  **专业化架构探索 (2025)**\n    *   **X-VLA**：引入**具身特定的软提示**，以极少的参数量实现跨具身泛化。\n    *   **SpatialVLA**：强调**空间理解**，引入3D位置编码和自适应动作网格来注入可迁移的空间知识。\n    *   **VideoVLA**：探索将**视频生成模型**转化为机器人操作器，通过联合预测动作序列和未来视觉结果，利用模型的“视觉想象力”。\n    *   **价值**：针对VLA的不同薄弱环节（跨平台、空间推理、长视野想象）进行专项增强，体现了领域内的精细化探索。\n\n#### 方向三：**解决核心病理：指令跟随与泛化鲁棒性**\n这是本文所处的核心方向，旨在解决数据偏差导致的模型退化问题。\n\n1.  **问题发现与实证 (前期工作，如本文第2节所述)**\n    *   **改进**：通过系统的对照实验（如“仅视觉”训练），实证揭示了当前VLA模型在目标驱动数据集上存在严重的“**视觉捷径**”问题。模型实际上学习的是 `p(a|v)` 而非真正的 `π(a|v, ℓ)`，导致在模糊或OOD场景下失败。\n    *   **价值**：精准定位了VLA泛化能力差的根本原因之一——**条件互信息坍缩**，为后续解决方案提供了明确靶点。\n\n2.  **BayesVLA (Xu et al., 2025) - 同期相关工作**\n    *   **改进**：同样采用**贝叶斯分解**思路，使用CLIP编码器和扩散Transformer，通过两阶段框架（先训练视觉条件先验，再注入语言感知token）来应对语言多样性不足的问题。\n    *   **局限**：未将训练扩展到大规模VLM，且其解决方案未系统性针对“视觉捷径”病理。\n\n3.  **本文工作：BayesianVLA**\n    *   **核心改进**：\n        *   **理论框架**：明确提出通过最大化动作与指令的**条件点互信息**来对抗信息坍缩，并推导出可优化的对数似然比目标。\n        *   **架构创新**：引入**潜在动作查询**作为VLM与动作头之间的瓶颈接口，并利用因果掩码巧妙地实现**双分支架构**，分别建模先验 `p(a|v)` 和后验 `π(a|v, ℓ)`。\n        *   **训练策略**：在共享的VLM权重上，通过双分支和LLR损失进行联合优化，强制模型关注语言指令中无法从视觉中推断的信息。\n        *   **实际价值**：**无需新数据**，即在OOD基准上取得显著提升（如SimplerEnv上+11.3%），同时较好地保留了VLM主干的语言推理能力，推理时无额外计算开销。\n\n### 总结：几个主要发展方向\n\n1.  **数据与评估驱动方向**：持续追求更大规模、更多样化、更跨域的数据集，并建立严谨的仿真与实体评估基准，为模型发展提供燃料和标尺。\n2.  **架构与算法驱动方向**：探索更高效的VLM适配方法（微调、提示、双系统）、更优的动作表示与生成方式（扩散、流匹配、token化），以及针对特定能力（空间、规划、跨平台）的专项增强。\n3.  **鲁棒性与泛化理论方向**：深入分析模型失败的根本原因（如本文的“视觉捷径”、信息坍缩），并从信息论、贝叶斯理论等角度提出正则化或结构化解决方案，旨在提升模型对指令的理解忠实度和在分布外场景的稳定性。\n\n**BayesianVLA** 属于第三个方向上的代表性进展。它没有追求更大的模型或更多的数据，而是通过一个精巧的理论驱动框架，直击当前VLA训练范式中的固有缺陷，从而在现有数据上“挤”出了更高的泛化性能和鲁棒性。这标志着VLA研究从“规模扩张”向“质量提升”和“原理深化”的重要转变。",

            "answer": "好的，作为一名专业的学术论文分析助手，我将为您详细解析《BayesianVLA》论文提出的关键技术方法。\n\n## 论文核心方法解析\n\n论文《BayesianVLA》旨在解决视觉-语言-动作模型中因数据集偏差导致的“视觉捷径”问题。其核心是通过贝叶斯分解，强制模型学习真正依赖于语言指令的策略。关键技术方法总结如下：\n\n| 方法组件 | 技术细节与数学原理 | 具体参数/实现 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **1. 问题形式化与目标函数** | **核心洞察**：标准训练目标（最大化对数似然 $\\log \\pi(a \\mid v, \\ell)$）在数据集存在强视觉-语言关联（$p(\\ell \\mid v)$ 尖锐）时，会导致条件互信息 $I(\\ell; a \\mid v)$ 坍缩，模型退化为视觉先验策略 $p(a \\mid v)$。<br><br>**贝叶斯分解**：根据贝叶斯定理，最优策略可分解为：<br>$\\pi(a \\mid v, \\ell) = \\frac{p(\\ell \\mid a, v) \\cdot p(a \\mid v)}{p(\\ell \\mid v)}$<br>其中 $p(a \\mid v)$ 是视觉先验，$p(\\ell \\mid a, v)$ 是似然。<br><br>**新目标函数**：为避免坍缩，改为最大化**条件逐点互信息**：<br>$\\text{PMI}(a, \\ell \\mid v) = \\log \\frac{\\pi(a \\mid v, \\ell)}{p(a \\mid v)} = \\log \\frac{p(\\ell \\mid a, v)}{p(\\ell \\mid v)}$<br>这等价于最大化**对数似然比**：<br>$\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{LLR}} = \\log p(\\ell \\mid a, v) - \\log p(\\ell \\mid v)$<br>该目标惩罚仅从视觉 $v$ 即可预测指令 $\\ell$ 的情况，奖励那些能为 $\\ell$ 提供额外信息的动作 $a$。 | **训练目标**：$\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{total}} = (1-\\lambda)\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{FM}}(\\psi; \\mathbf{H}_{\\mathcal{Q}}^{\\text{post}}) + \\lambda\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{FM}}(\\psi; \\mathbf{H}_{\\mathcal{Q}}^{\\text{prior}}) - \\beta\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{LLR}}$<br>**超参数**：$\\lambda$ 平衡先验与后验动作损失（论文未给出具体值，需调参），$\\beta$ 控制 LLR 正则化强度。 |\n| **2. 潜在动作查询** | **设计目的**：在统一的 VLM 架构中实例化贝叶斯分解，作为 VLM 与下游连续动作头（DiT）之间的**瓶颈接口**。它允许通过简单的序列位置调整，精确控制查询所能访问的上下文信息（仅视觉或视觉+语言）。<br><br>**实现方式**：在 VLM 的词表中添加 $K$ 个可学习的特殊令牌（Token），记为 $\\mathcal{Q} = \\{\\texttt{<\\|action\\_0\\|>}, \\dots, \\texttt{<\\|action\\_K\\|>}\\}$。这些令牌被附加到输入序列中，**仅使用**它们对应的隐藏状态 $\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathcal{Q}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{K \\times D}$ 来条件化动作生成器。<br><br>**优势**：<br>1. **计算效率**：将 DiT 的条件处理复杂度从 $O(N^2)$（$N$ 为所有视觉语言令牌数）降低到 $O(K^2)$（$K$ 为小的常数）。<br>2. **信息控制**：利用解码器 VLM 的因果注意力掩码，通过改变 $\\mathcal{Q}$ 在输入序列中的位置，即可实现信息流的严格分离。 | **参数**：$K = 64$ 个查询令牌。<br>**维度**：隐藏状态维度 $D$ 取决于骨干 VLM（如 Qwen3-VL）。<br>**动作头**：使用 Diffusion Transformer 作为连续动作生成器。 |\n| **3. 双分支训练框架** | **核心思想**：使用共享权重的单一 VLM，通过构建两种不同的输入序列，同时学习视觉先验 $p(a \\mid v)$ 和语言后验策略 $\\pi(a \\mid v, \\ell)$。<br><br>**先验分支**：<br>输入序列：$\\text{Input}_{\\text{prior}} = [v, \\mathcal{Q}, \\ell]$<br>由于因果掩码，$\\mathcal{Q}$ 只能看到前面的视觉 $v$，无法看到后面的语言 $\\ell$。因此其隐藏状态 $\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathcal{Q}}^{\\text{prior}}$ 编码纯视觉信息，用于预测动作，损失为 $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{prior}}$，学习 $p(a \\mid v)$。<br><br>**后验分支**：<br>输入序列：$\\text{Input}_{\\text{post}} = [v, \\ell, \\mathcal{Q}]$<br>此时 $\\mathcal{Q}$ 能看到前面的 $v$ 和 $\\ell$，其隐藏状态 $\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathcal{Q}}^{\\text{post}}$ 编码完整上下文，损失为 $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{main}}$，学习 $\\pi(a \\mid v, \\ell)$。<br><br>**LLR 目标的实现**：<br>利用 VLM 的语言建模损失作为 $\\log p(\\ell \\mid \\dots)$ 的代理。<br>在先验分支中，语言 $\\ell$ 的生成概率基于 $[v, \\mathcal{Q}]$，由于 $\\mathcal{Q}$ 编码了先验动作信息，这近似于 $p(\\ell \\mid v, a_{\\text{prior}})$。<br>LLR 损失计算为：<br>$\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{LLR}} = \\log p(\\ell \\mid v, \\mathbf{H}_{\\mathcal{Q}}^{\\text{prior}}) - \\text{sg}(\\log p(\\ell \\mid v))$<br>其中 $\\text{sg}(\\cdot)$ 是**停止梯度**操作，防止模型通过降低基线 $p(\\ell \\mid v)$（损害 VLM 的通用能力）来简单地最大化比值。 | **训练流程**：每个训练步同时进行两个分支的前向传播，共享 VLM 权重。<br>**动作损失**：使用**整流流匹配**损失：<br>$\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{FM}}(\\psi; \\mathbf{C}) = \\mathbb{E}_{t,\\mathbf{a}_0,\\mathbf{a}_1} [\\| v_{\\psi}(\\mathbf{a}_t, t, \\mathbf{C}) - (\\mathbf{a}_1 - \\mathbf{a}_0) \\|^2]$<br>其中 $\\mathbf{a}_t = (1-t)\\mathbf{a}_0 + t\\mathbf{a}_1$, $t \\in [0,1]$。<br>**推理**：仅使用后验分支，无额外计算开销。 |\n| **4. 整体训练与推理** | **总损失**：如上述表格所示，结合了后验动作损失、先验动作损失和 LLR 正则化项。<br><br>**优化细节**：使用 AdamW 优化器，初始学习率 1e-5，余弦退火调度。采用 DeepSpeed ZeRO-2、梯度裁剪（范数 1.0）等系统级优化。<br><br>**关键优势**：该方法**无需收集新数据**，仅通过改变模型架构和训练目标，即可在存在偏差的现有数据集中恢复出真正的语言条件策略。 | **硬件**：16 块 NVIDIA H100 GPU。<br>**骨干网络**：基于 StarVLA 框架，实例化为 QwenGR00T 架构（Qwen3-VL-4B）。<br>**训练数据**：BridgeDataV2, Fractal, PhysicalAI-Robotics-GR00T-X-Embodiment-Sim 等。 |\n\n### **技术创新与实际价值总结**\n\n1.  **理论创新**：首次从信息论角度将 VLA 模型的失败模式形式化为“信息坍缩”，并提出了基于条件 PMI 最大化的贝叶斯分解解决方案，为理解模型退化提供了清晰的理论框架。\n2.  **架构创新**：提出的“潜在动作查询”是一种简洁而高效的架构设计，它作为信息瓶颈和可控接口，巧妙地利用 VLM 的因果注意力机制实现双分支学习，计算开销低。\n3.  **训练策略创新**：双分支训练与 LLR 目标相结合，是一种有效的**内部去偏**方法。它迫使模型挖掘动作与指令之间超越视觉相关性的因果联系，从而提高了对模糊场景和分布外环境的泛化能力。\n4.  **实际价值**：\n    *   **提升性能**：在 SimplerEnv 和 RoboCasa 基准上显著超越基线，尤其在 OOD 场景下提升达 11.3%。\n    *   **保持通用能力**：LLR 目标中的停止梯度操作有助于保留骨干 VLM 的文本对话能力，",

            "answer": "## 论文评价指标与数据集分析\n\n### 一、 主要评价指标\n\n论文在两个核心仿真基准上评估模型性能，**核心评价指标均为任务成功率**。具体细节如下：\n\n| 基准名称 | 评价指标名称 | 指标定义与计算细节 | 统计显著性处理 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **SimplerEnv** | **平均成功率 (Avg@480)** | 对每个任务，使用官方评估脚本进行 **480 次独立试验**，计算成功执行任务的次数比例。 | 通过大量独立试验（480次）来**减少随机性影响**，确保结果稳定可靠。 |\n| **RoboCasa** | **平均成功率 (Avg@50)** | 对每个任务，进行 **50 次独立试验**，计算平均成功率。 | 使用50次试验保证**统计显著性**，以验证方法在复杂任务上的鲁棒性。 |\n\n**指标核心解读**：\n- **任务成功率** 是机器人操作领域最直接、最关键的指标，直接反映了策略完成指定指令的能力。\n- 两个基准均采用**多次独立试验取平均**的方式，这是为了消除仿真环境中的随机噪声（如物理引擎随机初始化、动作执行噪声等），使性能对比更公平、更具说服力。\n- 论文通过对比 **BayesianVLA** 与众多基线模型（如 `π0.5`、`Isaac-GR00T`、`QwenGR00T`等）在该指标上的表现，来证明其有效性。\n\n### 二、 使用的数据集\n\n论文在训练和评估中使用了多个大规模机器人操作数据集，具体细节如下表：\n\n| 数据集名称 | 用途 | 关键特点与细节 | 在本文中的作用 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **BridgeDataV2** (Walke et al., 2023) | **训练 & 动机分析** | - **特点**：大规模、“野外”采集的真实机器人数据，场景和任务**多样化**。<br>- **细节**：包含多种机器人平台在非结构化环境中的操作轨迹。 | 1. **训练**：用于在SimplerEnv基准上微调模型。<br>2. **动机实验**：用于展示即使在多样数据中，标准模型也会过拟合到**视觉捷径**（如特定背景、光照），导致OOD泛化失败。 |\n| **Fractal** (Brohan et al., 2022) | **训练** | - **特点**：大规模仿真数据，是RT-1数据集的一部分，包含丰富的桌面操作任务。 | 与BridgeDataV2**组合使用**，在SimplerEnv基准上进行模型训练，提供更丰富的训练样本。 |\n| **PhysicalAI-Robotics-GR00T-X-Embodiment-Sim** (Bjorck et al., 2025b) 的 **Humanoid Robot Tabletop Manipulation** 子集 | **训练** | - **特点**：针对类人机器人（GR1）的桌面操作仿真数据，是GR00T项目的一部分。 | 专门用于在 **RoboCasa** 基准上训练和评估模型，确保任务和机器人形态匹配。 |\n| **LIBERO** (Liu et al., 2023) | **动机分析** | - **特点**：系统性研究终身学习的基准，包含四个子集（Spatial, Object, Long, **Goal**）。<br>- **关键细节**：**Goal子集**具有**内在模糊性**——同一视觉场景对应多个可能任务。 | 用于**关键诊断实验**：证明在任务明确的子集上，视觉仅用模型表现接近完整模型；而在**模糊的Goal子集**上，视觉仅用模型性能暴跌，揭示了标准模型忽略语言指令的本质问题。 |\n\n### 三、 评估基准（测试集）\n\n模型在以下两个仿真基准上进行最终性能评估：\n\n| 基准名称 | 评估任务举例 | 环境与任务特点 | 评估目的 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **SimplerEnv** (Li et al., 2024c) | 1. 把勺子放到毛巾上<br>2. 把胡萝卜放到盘子上<br>3. 将绿色积木堆叠到黄色积木上<br>4. 把茄子放进黄色篮子里 | - **特点**：**视觉分布外（OOD）** 的仿真环境。训练数据（BridgeV2, Fractal）来自真实或不同仿真环境，而测试在此特定仿真中进行。<br>- **挑战**：测试场景的**视觉外观、纹理、光照**与训练数据有显著差异。 | **核心评估OOD泛化能力**。旨在检验模型是否真正理解了语言指令，而非仅仅记忆了训练数据中的视觉关联。BayesianVLA在此获得**11.3%** 的显著提升，证明了其打破“视觉捷径”的有效性。 |\n| **RoboCasa** (Nasiriany et al., 2024) GR1 Tabletop Benchmark | 1. PnP Bottle To Cabinet Close<br>2. PnP Can To Drawer Close<br>3. PnP Novel From Placemat To Plate<br>... (共24个任务) | - **特点**：**复杂、多样化**的桌面操作任务，涉及带关节的物体（橱柜、抽屉）、电器（微波炉）及多种几何形状的容器。<br>- **挑战**：任务复杂，需要精确的空间理解和与物体的交互。 | **评估在复杂、同分布（ID）任务上的性能**。尽管是ID测试，但论文发现该基准存在严重的“视觉捷径”问题（VisionOnly基线成功率高达44.7%）。BayesianVLA在此仍取得SOTA，证明其能迫使模型利用语言信息来解决复杂任务。 |\n\n### 总结\n本文构建了一个严谨的评估体系：\n1.  **指标**：采用**任务成功率**这一核心指标，并通过大量重复实验确保结果可靠性。\n2.  **数据**：使用**多样化、大规模**的公开数据集进行训练，并利用**LIBERO**进行深入的病理学分析。\n3.  **基准**：在 **SimplerEnv (OOD)** 和 **RoboCasa (复杂ID)** 两个互补的基准上进行全面测试，分别验证模型的**泛化能力**和**复杂任务解决能力**。\n\n这种评估设计有力地支撑了论文的核心论点：**BayesianVLA 通过贝叶斯分解和最大化互信息，有效缓解了数据偏差导致的“视觉捷径”问题，从而在保持语言理解能力的同时，显著提升了策略的泛化性和鲁棒性。**",

            "question": "论文的主要局限性有哪些？未来可能的改进方向是什么？",
            "answer": "## 论文主要局限性分析\n\n基于对论文内容的深入阅读，以下是**BayesianVLA**方法的主要局限性：\n\n### 1. **训练阶段的计算开销增加**\n- **问题描述**： 论文提出的双分支架构（先验分支与后验分支）在训练时需要同时计算两个分支，这**理论上增加了每次迭代的计算成本**。\n- **具体影响**： 虽然论文指出通过**前缀预填充策略**（Prefill Strategy）可以复用视觉编码器的输出，从而将实际增加的时间控制在可接受范围内，但这仍然是一个额外的工程优化负担，并且可能影响大规模训练的效率。\n\n### 2. **视觉-语言对话能力的潜在退化**\n- **问题描述**： 论文承认，尽管**BayesianVLA**成功保留了VLM骨干的**纯文本对话能力**，但其**视觉-语言对话能力**（如图像+文本输入的多模态推理）在VLA训练后仍可能退化。\n- **根本原因**： 论文假设这是因为**视觉编码器**和**多模态融合/投影层**必须为控制任务进行适配，这可能导致视觉表征偏离预训练的视觉-语言对齐流形。这种“专业化”对于为动作优化的具身智能体来说是预期的，但牺牲了部分通用的多模态理解能力。\n\n### 3. **实验验证的广度有待扩展**\n- **问题描述**： 当前工作主要在**SimplerEnv**和**RoboCasa**两个模拟基准上进行验证。论文在“局限性与未来工作”部分明确指出，计划在后续版本中提供更全面的评估。\n- **具体缺失**：\n    - **更多基准**： 如RoboTwin、LIBERO等。\n    - **真实世界机器人实验**： 目前所有实验均在仿真环境中进行，缺乏物理世界的验证。\n    - **更大规模的基础模型**： 实验基于Qwen3-VL-4B，未扩展到如8B等更大参数量的模型。\n    - **更详尽的消融研究**： 对贝叶斯分解框架中每个组件和超参数的贡献分析尚不完整。\n\n### 4. **方法对数据偏差的缓解程度存在上限**\n- **问题描述**： **BayesianVLA**的核心是通过优化目标（LLR）来“惩罚”视觉捷径，迫使模型关注语言指令。然而，这种方法**本质上是在有偏的数据集上进行正则化**。\n- **潜在风险**： 如果数据集的偏差极其严重（即 `H(ℓ∣v) ≈ 0`），模型可能仍然难以学习到真正鲁棒的语言-动作 grounding，因为优化信号本身可能很弱。方法的效果高度依赖于LLR目标能否提供足够强的梯度信号来克服数据偏差。\n\n---\n\n## 未来可能的改进方向\n\n基于论文的“讨论”和“局限性与未来工作”部分，未来研究可以从以下几个方向展开：\n\n### 1. **数据策略的根本性变革**\n- **收集“模糊性”数据**： 主动在**无法仅从初始观察推断任务**的场景中收集数据。例如，同一视觉场景对应多个合理任务，迫使模型必须依赖语言指令进行消歧。这能自然增加语言的条件熵 `H(ℓ∣v)`，从根本上缓解信息坍塌。\n- **利用人类活动数据**： 融合大规模人类视频数据（如HRDT, METIS）。人类活动具有内在的多模态和上下文依赖性，同一环境中的行为多样性更高，可能提供更丰富、更少确定性的 `p(ℓ∣v)` 分布，有助于缓解机器人专用数据中的信息坍塌。\n\n### 2. **架构与算法扩展**\n- **扩展到世界模型框架**： 论文指出，基于世界模型（World Models）的VLA方法（如F1-VLA, Mantis）提供了另一种贝叶斯公式的实例化。未来可以将**BayesianVLA**的核心思想（最大化动作与指令的互信息）与**世界模型的前向预测能力**相结合。世界模型对动作 `a` 敏感，其预测分布丰富，可能能更自然地避免分子（似然）坍缩到分母（边缘似然）。\n- **探索更高效的训练机制**： 设计更轻量化的双分支训练策略，或研究单分支但能隐式建模先验与后验差异的方法，以进一步降低训练开销。\n- **参数规模扩展**： 将框架应用到参数量更大的VLM骨干（如Qwen3-VL-8B）上，验证其可扩展性和性能提升的规律。\n\n### 3. **能力保留与权衡的优化**\n- **解耦视觉表征学习**： 研究如何更好地**解耦用于控制的视觉特征**和**用于多模态理解的视觉特征**。例如，通过引入适配器（Adapter）、提示词（Prompt）或专门的投影网络，在微调时尽可能少地破坏预训练的视觉-语言对齐，从而更好地保留通用的视觉-语言对话能力。\n- **多任务协同训练**： 探索在VLA训练中联合优化控制损失和语言建模/视觉问答损失，以明确地正则化和保留骨干模型的通用能力。\n\n### 4. **更全面与严格的评估**\n- **跨基准与真实世界验证**： 在更多样化的仿真基准（如LIBERO-Goal的模糊场景）和真实的物理机器人平台上进行系统评估，证明方法的泛化性和实用性。\n- **深入的诊断性分析**：\n    - **定量测量信息坍塌**： 在训练过程中直接监测条件互信息 `I(ℓ; a∣v)` 的变化，更直观地展示方法如何缓解该问题。\n    - **消融研究**： 系统分析损失函数中平衡因子 `λ` 和 `β`、潜在动作查询的数量 `K`、以及双分支的具体实现方式对最终性能的影响。\n\n### 5. **理论基础的深化**\n- **信息论视角的进一步探索**： 更深入地分析在数据偏差存在下，不同训练目标（如最大似然估计 vs. 互信息最大化）的收敛性和鲁棒性，为方法设计提供更坚实的理论指导。\n\n**总结**： **BayesianVLA** 的核心贡献在于通过贝叶斯分解和互信息最大化，巧妙地**在现有有偏数据上**提升了VLA模型的指令跟随和OOD泛化能力。其主要的局限在于**训练开销**、**多模态能力保留的权衡**以及**实验验证的广度**。未来的改进将围绕**数据、架构、评估**三个层面展开，旨在构建更高效、更通用、更经得起实践检验的具身智能模型。",
