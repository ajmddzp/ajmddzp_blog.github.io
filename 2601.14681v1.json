We introduce FARE, a hierarchical autonomous exploration framework that integrates a large language model (LLM) for global reasoning with a reinforcement learning (RL) policy for local decision making. FARE follows a fast-slow thinking paradigm. The slow-thinking LLM module interprets a concise textual description of the unknown environment and synthesizes an agent-level exploration strategy, which is then grounded into a sequence of global waypoints through a topological graph. To further improve reasoning efficiency, this module employs a modularity-based pruning mechanism that reduces redundant graph structures. The fast-thinking RL module executes exploration by reacting to local observations while being guided by the LLM-generated global waypoints. The RL policy is additionally shaped by a reward term that encourages adherence to the global waypoints, enabling coherent and robust closed-loop behavior. This architecture decouples semantic reasoning from geometric decision, allowing each module to operate in its appropriate temporal and spatial scale. In challenging simulated environments, our results show that FARE achieves substantial improvements in exploration efficiency over state-of-the-art baselines. We further deploy FARE on hardware and validate it in complex, large scale\n200\n​\nm\n×\n130\n​\nm\n200m\\times 130m\nbuilding environment.\nI\nINTRODUCTION\nAutonomous exploration is a core capability for mobile robots operating in unknown environments, where the objective is to efficiently acquire geometric information. The robot acquires environmental data through sensors such as 3D LiDARs or cameras and incrementally builds a representation of the environment, commonly encoded as an occupancy grid or voxel map.\nWith the reliability of modern LiDAR odometry and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), recent work has increasingly focused on the exploration problem itself, without concerns about mapping or localization accuracy\n[\n21\n,\n4\n,\n13\n,\n20\n,\n16\n,\n18\n,\n6\n]\n. Yet, despite substantial progress, efficient exploration in complex real-world environments remains challenging. Existing planners struggle to leverage long-term structural information embedded in the evolving map and often rely on fixed heuristics or rigid decision rules that limit their ability to adapt exploration strategies to different environmental characteristics.\nExisting autonomous exploration approaches are largely divided into conventional methods and learning based methods. Conventional planners maintain a geometric belief map and plan motions that trade off investigating new regions and further refining partially explored areas\n[\n28\n,\n2\n,\n21\n,\n13\n]\n. To improve scalability in large and complex environments, recent conventional planners increasingly rely on hierarchical planning, which decouples exploration into a low-resolution global path computed over a coarse belief and a high-resolution local path computed over the nearby detailed map\n[\n29\n,\n4\n,\n16\n,\n18\n]\n. The key insight there is that fine reasoning is most effective locally, while coarse inference suffices for guiding long-term exploration. By contrast, learning-based methods formulate exploration as a partially observable Markov decision process and use RL to learn policies that map observations to next waypoint\n[\n9\n,\n10\n,\n5\n,\n7\n]\n. These methods improve exploration efficiency through reward designs that encourage informative observations and reduce redundant motions, often supported by neural architectures that capture spatial correlations in the evolving map.\nDespite these advances, existing methods still struggle to exploit long-term information and to adapt their exploration strategy in response to evolving environments.\nConventional planners rely on fixed hyperparameters that determine how they balance path length with information gain or how they choose the resolution of the global representation. These parameters typically remain constant throughout deployment, which prevents the planner from adjusting its behavior in different environments. As a result, the planner may act too conservatively in open spaces or spend unnecessary effort refining cluttered areas. Even hierarchical planners face similar constraints. Their performance depends on a predefined coarse-to-fine decomposition of the map, which restricts how global structural information can influence local decisions.\nLearning-based planners encounter a different but equally important limitation. The objective in autonomous exploration is to minimize the overall time or distance required to complete coverage, yet this objective only becomes observable at the end of an episode. The reward signal therefore becomes extremely sparse, making it difficult for the policy to learn behaviors that depend on long-term consequences. Existing methods address this issue by introducing dense rewards that provide immediate feedback proportional to newly observed information\n[\n9\n,\n10\n,\n26\n,\n30\n]\n. Although this improves training stability, it also biases the optimization process toward short-term, immediately observable information gain.\nAs a result, long-horizon credit assignment becomes significantly more challenging in practice, making it difficult for the policy to reliably acquire behaviors such as long-distance backtracking or exploiting distant structural cues that only become relevant later in the mission.\nConsequently, both conventional and learning-based approaches still struggle to utilize long-term information effectively and to adjust their exploration strategy as environmental conditions change.\nInspired by the impressive intelligence emerging in recent AI developments, we propose FARE, a novel hierarchical fast–slow thinking framework that separates global reasoning from local decision making.\nOur slow-thinking module operates at the global level and reasons over a sparse belief graph derived from community detection and modularity-based clustering\n[\n6\n]\n. Given a concise textual description of the environment, our slow-thinking module extracts high-level spatial characteristics and obstacle configurations, which are then used to synthesize an exploration strategy tailored to the overall map structure. This strategy is grounded onto the global belief graph to generate a sequence of global waypoints that reflect long-range coverage priorities and adapt as the partial map is incrementally updated.\nOur fast-thinking module operates at the local level and uses a reinforcement learning policy to select actions based on dense local map information, including frontiers and nearby geometric features. During deployment, the policy reacts in real time to local observations while also incorporating the global waypoints supplied by the slow-thinking module. To ensure that the learned policy can follow long-horizon guidance without relying on overly myopic reward shaping, the training process includes an additional reward term that encourages consistency with the global waypoints. This design allows the policy to remain responsive to local conditions while still pursuing long-term objectives.\nThrough this structured interaction, our framework effectively integrates global reasoning with local decision, enabling the robot to exploit long-term information and to adapt its exploration behavior as the environment unfolds.\nAs demonstrated in simulations and real-world robot validation, this design reduces unnecessary backtracking and yields more efficient exploration trajectories.\nII\nRELATED WORK\nII-A\nAutonomous Exploration\nAutonomous exploration has been widely studied using both conventional and learning-based approaches.\nConventional planners are predominantly frontier-based, selecting exploration targets at the boundary between known and unknown regions, where early methods directly navigate to individual frontier points, leading to greedy and myopic behavior\n[\n14\n]\n.\nLater works reformulate exploration as a viewpoint selection problem, in which candidate viewpoints are sampled and evaluated based on expected information gain and feasibility, enabling non-myopic planning through sampling-based strategies\n[\n2\n,\n27\n]\n.\nTo improve scalability in large environments, many works adopt hierarchical designs that combine fine-grained local planning with coarse global representations.\nRepresentative approaches construct sparse global frontier graphs or viewpoint graphs to guide long-range navigation, while local planners handle detailed viewpoint sampling and collision checking\n[\n4\n,\n16\n]\n.\nWhile effective, these methods rely on manually designed global representations and planning heuristics, and require careful balancing between representation sparsity and coverage, which is difficult to achieve in environments with unknown or evolving structures.\nLearning-based exploration methods aim to alleviate manual design by training policies to guide exploration decisions.\nSome works employ supervised learning to explicitly predict occupancy or semantic maps from partial observations, and then integrate the predicted maps into conventional frontier-based planners\n[\n9\n,\n26\n]\n.\nMore recent approaches formulate exploration as a sequential decision-making problem and use reinforcement learning to estimate long-term returns from observations.\nMany of these methods rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to process fixed-size map representations or local occupancy grids\n[\n19\n,\n9\n,\n26\n,\n30\n]\n, with different action abstractions ranging from frontier or viewpoint selection\n[\n9\n,\n26\n]\nto direct navigation commands such as velocity or steering control\n[\n30\n,\n10\n]\n.\nTo address the limited scalability and robustness of CNN-based planners, recent works adopt graph learning-based representations and formulate exploration as a next-viewpoint selection problem on a graph\n[\n5\n,\n7\n,\n6\n]\n, enabling variable-sized environments.\nDespite these advances, existing methods still struggle to exploit long-term information and adapt their exploration behavior as the environment evolves, largely because exploration decisions are conditioned on local observations or fixed representations, without explicitly leveraging readily available, high-level environment priors to guide planning.\nII-B\nLLM-based Graph Reasoning\nLLM-based graph reasoning has advanced substantially in recent years, as an increasing body of work shows that large language models can exploit structured relational information when graphs are presented in suitable, structured formats.\nA central challenge in this line of research lies in how graph structures are encoded and provided to LLMs in a way that preserves relational semantics while remaining compatible with text-based or embedding-based model interfaces.\nTo this end, widely adopted approaches introduce structured graph verbalizers, embedding projectors, or instruction-tuned schemas that convert nodes, edges, and local neighborhoods into sequential representations that LLMs can reliably process\n[\n15\n,\n23\n,\n11\n,\n12\n]\n.\nBuilding on such representations, another line of work focuses on strengthening LLM reasoning capabilities over graphs.\nRecent methods incorporate guided graph traversal, community-aware pruning, and explicitly structured reasoning steps to facilitate multi-hop inference and long-range dependency modeling on complex graphs\n[\n22\n,\n1\n,\n17\n]\n.\nIn parallel, hybrid approaches couple LLMs with dedicated graph encoders or multimodal modules, allowing symbolic or geometric graph features to complement language-based reasoning, as exemplified by GraphLLM and multimodal extensions such as GITA\n[\n8\n,\n24\n]\n.\nDespite these advances, existing LLM-based graph reasoning methods are evaluated primarily on static, offline benchmarks, and rarely address the challenges posed by dynamic, partially observed, and incrementally evolving graph structures that arise in real-world robotic environments.\nIII\nPROBLEM FORMULATION\nLet\nℰ\n⊂\nℝ\n2\n\\mathcal{E}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{2}\ndenote a bounded and initially unknown environment, represented by a two-dimensional occupancy grid. During exploration, the robot incrementally constructs a partial map\nℳ\n\\mathcal{M}\n, which is decomposed into known and unknown regions,\nℳ\n=\nℳ\nu\n∪\nℳ\nk\n.\n\\mathcal{M}=\\mathcal{M}_{\\text{u}}\\cup\\mathcal{M}_{\\text{k}}.\n(1)\nThe known region\nℳ\nk\n\\mathcal{M}_{\\text{k}}\nis further partitioned into free and occupied space\nℳ\nk\n=\nℳ\nf\n∪\nℳ\no\n\\mathcal{M}_{\\text{k}}=\\mathcal{M}_{\\text{f}}\\cup\\mathcal{M}_{\\text{o}}\n, where\nℳ\nf\n\\mathcal{M}_{\\text{f}}\ndenotes traversable space and\nℳ\no\n\\mathcal{M}_{\\text{o}}\ndenotes occupied space.\nAt the beginning of exploration, the environment is completely unknown, i.e.,\nℳ\n=\nℳ\nu\n\\mathcal{M}=\\mathcal{M}_{\\text{u}}\n. At each decision step, the robot acquires observations using an omnidirectional LiDAR with sensing range\nd\ns\nd_{s}\n, and cells within the sensing range are classified as either free or occupied according to traversability.\nThe objective of autonomous exploration is to compute a collision-free trajectory that minimizes the total traversal cost while completing the exploration,\nτ\n∗\n=\nargmin\nτ\n∈\n𝒯\n​\nL\n​\n(\nτ\n)\n,\ns.t.\n​\nℳ\nk\n=\nℳ\ng\n\\tau^{*}=\\underset{\\tau\\in\\mathcal{T}}{\\operatorname{argmin}}L(\\tau),\\quad\\text{ s.t. }\\mathcal{M}_{\\text{k}}=\\mathcal{M}_{g}\n(2)\nwhere\n𝒯\n\\mathcal{T}\ndenotes the set of feasible trajectories and\nL\n:\nτ\n→\nℝ\n+\nL:\\tau\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{+}\nmaps a trajectory to its total path length. While the ground-truth map\nℳ\ng\n\\mathcal{M}_{g}\nis not available during real-world deployment, it is accessible in simulation and benchmark settings for evaluation. In practice, exploration completion is commonly approximated by the absence of remaining unknown or frontier regions.\nIV\nMETHODOLOGY\nIV-A\nHierarchical Robot Belief Graph\nIn this work, we construct a hierarchical robot belief graph through the community-based method proposed in\n[\n6\n]\n. It represents the neighboring area of the robot as a dense local graph, which will serve as the input for the fast-thinking module, and the distant areas as a sparse global graph, which will serve as the input for the slow-thinking module.\nIV-A\n1\nLocal Belief Graph\nThe robot belief is represented by a collision-free graph constructed from onboard sensor data. The robot trajectory is defined as a sequence of viewpoints\nτ\n=\n(\nv\n0\n,\nv\n1\n,\n…\n)\n\\tau=(v_{0},v_{1},\\dots)\n, where each waypoint\nv\ni\n∈\nℳ\nf\nv_{i}\\in\\mathcal{M}_{f}\nlies in free space.\nAt each decision step\nt\nt\n, a set of candidate viewpoints\nV\nt\n=\n{\nv\n0\n,\nv\n1\n,\n…\n}\nV_{t}=\\{v_{0},v_{1},\\dots\\}\n, with\nv\ni\n=\n(\nx\ni\n,\ny\ni\n)\n∈\nℳ\nf\nv_{i}=(x_{i},y_{i})\\in\\mathcal{M}_{f}\n, is uniformly sampled from the current free space following the approach in TARE. Each viewpoint is connected to its\nk\nk\nnearest neighbors, and edges intersecting occupied or unknown regions are removed, yielding a collision-free graph\nG\nt\n=\n(\nV\nt\n,\nE\nt\n)\nG_{t}=(V_{t},E_{t})\n.\nThe robot selects viewpoints sequentially, forming a trajectory\nτ\ni\n∈\nV\nt\n\\tau_{i}\\in V_{t}\n. Each node\nv\ni\nv_{i}\nis assigned a utility value\nu\ni\nu_{i}\n, defined as the number of observable frontiers within sensor range. A frontier\nf\nj\nf_{j}\nis observable from\nv\ni\nv_{i}\nif the line segment\nL\n​\n(\nv\ni\n,\nf\nj\n)\nL(v_{i},f_{j})\nis collision-free and\n‖\nf\nj\n−\nv\ni\n‖\n≤\nd\ns\n\\|f_{j}-v_{i}\\|\\leq d_{s}\n. The utility is defined as\nu\ni\n=\n|\nF\no\n,\ni\n|\n,\n\\displaystyle u_{i}=|F_{o,i}|,\n(3)\n∀\nf\nj\n∈\nF\no\n,\ni\n,\n‖\nf\nj\n−\nv\ni\n‖\n≤\nd\ns\n,\n\\displaystyle\\forall f_{j}\\in F_{o,i},\\quad\\|f_{j}-v_{i}\\|\\leq d_{s},\nL\n​\n(\nv\ni\n,\nf\nj\n)\n∩\n(\nℳ\n−\nℳ\nf\n)\n=\n∅\n.\n\\displaystyle L(v_{i},f_{j})\\cap(\\mathcal{M}-\\mathcal{M}_{f})=\\emptyset.\nwhere\nF\no\n,\ni\nF_{o,i}\ndenotes the set of observable frontiers at\nv\ni\nv_{i}\n. Then we introduce a square sliding window\n𝒲\nlocal\n\\mathcal{W}_{\\text{local}}\nof size\nd\n×\nd\nd\\times d\n, centered at the robot’s current position\nv\ncur\nv_{\\text{cur}}\n, and construct the\nlocal belief graph\nG\nlocal\n=\n(\nV\nlocal\n,\nE\nlocal\n)\nG_{\\text{local}}=(V_{\\text{local}},E_{\\text{local}})\n. Here,\nV\nlocal\n⊂\nV\nt\nV_{\\text{local}}\\subset V_{t}\ncontains all candidate nodes within the window, and\nE\nlocal\n⊂\nE\nt\nE_{\\text{local}}\\subset E_{t}\nincludes the edges connecting those nodes.\nIV-A\n2\nGlobal Belief Graph with Modularity-Based Pruning\nWe construct the\nglobal belief graph\nG\nglobal\n=\n(\nV\nglobal\n,\nE\nglobal\n)\nG_{\\text{global}}=(V_{\\text{global}},E_{\\text{global}})\nby jointly performing community detection and modularity-based pruning on the collision-free graph\nG\nt\nG_{t}\n. Instead of retaining all detected communities, we explicitly select a subset of structurally informative communities according to their modularity contribution, and only these communities are promoted as high-level nodes for global reasoning.\nSpecifically, we first apply modularity-based community detection on\nG\nt\nG_{t}\n[\n3\n]\n, where the graph modularity is defined as\nQ\n=\n1\n2\n​\nm\n​\n∑\ni\n,\nj\n[\nA\ni\n​\nj\n−\nk\ni\n​\nk\nj\n2\n​\nm\n]\n​\nδ\n​\n(\nc\ni\n,\nc\nj\n)\n,\nQ=\\frac{1}{2m}\\sum_{i,j}\\left[A_{ij}-\\frac{k_{i}k_{j}}{2m}\\right]\\delta(c_{i},c_{j}),\n(4)\nwith\nm\nm\ndenoting the total number of edges,\nA\ni\n​\nj\nA_{ij}\nthe adjacency matrix,\nk\ni\nk_{i}\nthe degree of node\ni\ni\n, and\nδ\n​\n(\n⋅\n)\n\\delta(\\cdot)\nthe community indicator.\nLet\n𝒞\n\\mathcal{C}\ndenote the set of communities detected from\nG\nt\nG_{t}\n. For simplicity, we ignore edge weights and directions and reorganize the modularity objective at the community level:\nQ\n=\n1\n2\n​\nm\n​\n∑\nc\n∈\n𝒞\n∑\ni\n,\nj\n∈\nc\n[\nA\ni\n​\nj\n−\nk\ni\n​\nk\nj\n2\n​\nm\n]\n.\nQ=\\frac{1}{2m}\\sum_{c\\in\\mathcal{C}}\\sum_{i,j\\in c}\\left[A_{ij}-\\frac{k_{i}k_{j}}{2m}\\right].\n(5)\nFor each community\nc\nc\n, let\n∑\nin\n\\sum{\\mathrm{in}}\ndenote the number of edges in\nc\nc\n, and let\n∑\ntot\n\\sum{\\mathrm{tot}}\ndenote the number of edges connected to\nc\nc\n. Thus, we have:\n∑\ni\n,\nj\n∈\nc\nk\ni\n​\nk\nj\n2\n​\nm\n=\n(\n∑\ntot\n)\n2\n2\n​\nm\n,\n\\sum_{i,j\\in c}\\frac{k_{i}k_{j}}{2m}=\\frac{(\\sum{\\mathrm{tot}})^{2}}{2m},\n(6)\nthe modularity can be rewritten as\nQ\n=\n1\n2\n​\nm\n​\n∑\nc\n∈\n𝒞\n[\n∑\nin\n−\n(\n∑\ntot\n)\n2\n2\n​\nm\n]\n.\nQ=\\frac{1}{2m}\\sum_{c\\in\\mathcal{C}}\\left[\\sum{\\mathrm{in}}-\\frac{(\\sum{\\mathrm{tot}})^{2}}{2m}\\right].\n(7)\nThen, the modularity of community\nc\nc\nis\nQ\n​\n(\nc\n)\n=\n∑\nin\n−\n(\n∑\ntot\n)\n2\n2\n​\nm\n.\nQ(c)=\\sum{\\mathrm{in}}-\\frac{(\\sum{\\mathrm{tot}})^{2}}{2m}.\n(8)\nRather than preserving all communities, we directly integrate a pruning step into the construction of\nG\nglobal\nG_{\\text{global}}\nby retaining only the top-\nk\nk\ncommunities with the highest modularity contributions:\n𝒞\n′\n:=\nargtopk\nc\n⊆\n𝒞\n⁡\nQ\n​\n(\nc\n)\n.\n\\mathcal{C}^{\\prime}:=\\operatorname{argtopk}_{c\\subseteq\\mathcal{C}}Q(c).\n(9)\nEach retained community\nc\n⊆\n𝒞\n′\nc\\subseteq\\mathcal{C}^{\\prime}\nis abstracted as a node in\nV\nglobal\nV_{\\text{global}}\n, while edges in\nE\nglobal\nE_{\\text{global}}\nare induced by inter-community connectivity in\nG\nt\nG_{t}\n. In this way, the global belief graph is constructed directly from a pruned set of structurally coherent communities, yielding a compact yet informative high-level representation that significantly reduces reasoning complexity while preserving the dominant topological structure of the environment.\nIV-B\nSlow-Thinking Module\nIV-B\n1\nEnvironment Conditioned Strategy Generation\nThis part provides a principled mechanism for translating high-level environment descriptions into strategy-level guidance for autonomous exploration. Rather than directly prescribing actions or trajectories, it operates at the level of environment-conditioned reasoning, bridging semantic understanding and long-horizon planning objectives.\nAccording to the intuitive impression formed after a brief exposure to the environment, we give a concise natural language description that summarizes the environment type and its composition. The slow-thinking module first performs structured environment characterization using an LLM. To ensure interpretability and robustness, the analysis is constrained to a predefined schema that decomposes the environment into three complementary aspects.\nSpatial characteristics\ncapture the global layout and navigability of the environment, including openness, structural complexity, topological connectivity, and corridor width.\nObstacle characteristics\ndescribe the distribution and structure of obstacles, such as their density, predictability, and vertical variation.\nExploration challenges\nreflect task-level difficulties induced by the environment, including navigation difficulty, the likelihood of dead ends, and the necessity of backtracking.\nEnvironment Characterization Example\n”\nspatial characteristics\n”:\nopenness\n: ”confined”,\ncomplexity\n: ”moderate”,\nconnectivity\n: ”low”,\ncorridor width\n: ”narrow”\n”\nobstacle characteristics\n”:\ndensity\n: ”moderate”,\npredictability\n: ”irregular”,\nheight variation\n: ”flat”\n”\nexploration challenges\n”:\nnavigation difficulty\n: ”moderate”,\ndead end probability\n: ”moderate”,\nbacktracking necessity\n: ”moderate”\nBased on the extracted environment characteristics, we instantiate an exploration strategy by populating a set of predefined strategy dimensions. These dimensions provide a structured representation of agent-level exploration behavior and are designed to capture recurring decision patterns across diverse environments. Specifically, the strategy is parameterized along four complementary axes:\nspatial strategy\n,\nefficiency strategy\n,\nsafety strategy\n, and\ntask strategy\n. Each axis governs a distinct aspect of exploration behavior, including coverage patterns and traversal order, energy and time trade-offs, risk sensitivity and obstacle handling, and completion objectives and information priorities. The environment characteristics directly condition the values assigned to these dimensions. For instance, environments exhibiting low topological connectivity increase tolerance for backtracking and enforce stronger awareness of escape routes, reflecting the higher risk of entrapment. Dense or irregular obstacles bias the strategy toward conservative motion, larger obstacle clearance, and cautious treatment of unexplored regions. Similarly, high navigation difficulty favors exploration behaviors that prioritize reliability and path quality over speed. In this way, environment semantics are systematically translated into structured exploration strategies that remain interpretable and explicitly grounded in environmental factors.\nStrategy Example\n’\ndescription\n’: ’Outdoor environment with natural obstacles and terrain variations’,\n’\nspatial\n’: \n’coverage strategy’: ’boundary first’,\n’direction bias’: ’perimeter following’,\n’depth strategy’: ’balanced depth breadth’,\n’corridor handling’: ’natural path’\n,\n’\nefficiency\n’: \n’energy policy’: ’conservative’,\n’time constraint’: ’moderate’,\n’backtrack tolerance’: ’moderate’,\n’revisit policy’: ’avoid’\n,\n’\nsafety\n’: \n’obstacle clearance’: ’conservative’,\n’unknown area approach’: ’standard’,\n’dead end handling’: ’explore carefully’,\n’escape route awareness’: ’always maintain’\n,\n’\ntask\n’: \n’completion criteria’: ’time limited’,\n’information priority’: ’object detection’,\n’quality vs speed’: ’balanced’\nIV-B\n2\nGraph Reasoning\nGiven the pruned global belief graph\nG\nglobal\nG_{\\text{global}}\n, a textual strategy prompt\nx\nx\nand the episode memory\nm\nm\n, we perform iterative graph reasoning with the instance\nΠ\n\\Pi\nof LLMs. At reasoning depth\ni\ni\n, the LLMs perform:\nτ\ng\n=\nΠ\n​\n(\nG\nglobal\n,\nx\n,\nm\n)\n\\tau_{g}=\\Pi(G_{\\text{global}},\\,x,m)\n(10)\nwhere\nτ\ng\n=\n[\nv\ncur\n,\nv\n1\n,\n…\n,\nv\nm\n]\n\\tau_{g}=[v_{\\mathrm{cur}},v_{1},\\dots,v_{m}]\nis a global path from the current node to an unexplored node.\nIV-C\nFast-Thinking Module\nIV-C\n1\nPolicy Network\nThe fast-thinking module operates on a structured observation that integrates the local graph, utility, and global path.

At decision step\nt\nt\n, the fast-thinking policy is guided by a global path\nτ\nt\n∗\n\\tau_{t}^{*}\n, whose next waypoint is denoted as\nw\nt\n∗\nw_{t}^{*}\n, and selects a local waypoint\nw\nt\nw_{t}\nfor execution.\nAt a high level, following the global guidance reduces unnecessary detours and implicitly shortens the executed trajectory. While this objective can be expressed in terms of path length deviation, directly optimizing such quantities is impractical for reinforcement learning. Instead, we optimize a smooth surrogate that preserves the monotonic relationship with deviation from the global guidance. We define the normalized deviation between the policy-selected waypoint and the globally guided waypoint as\nd\nt\n=\n‖\nw\nt\n−\nw\nt\n∗\n‖\n4\n​\nΔ\nnode\n​\n2\n,\nd_{t}=\\frac{\\|w_{t}-w_{t}^{*}\\|}{4\\,\\Delta_{\\text{node}}\\sqrt{2}},\n(13)\nwhere\nΔ\nnode\n\\Delta_{\\text{node}}\ndenotes the node resolution. The normalization constant corresponds to an upper bound on admissible deviation measured in grid units, ensuring scale invariance across environments. The instruction following reward is then defined as an exponential penalty on the normalized deviation,\nr\nt\ndev\n=\n−\ne\nd\nt\n−\n1\ne\n−\n1\n,\nr_{t}^{\\text{dev}}=-\\frac{e^{d_{t}}-1}{e-1},\n(14)\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFigure 2\n:\nPerformance comparison between FARE and conventional baselines across 10 runs per method in each environment.\nTABLE I\n:\nComparison results in three environment.\n(a)\nIndoor\nDistance (\nm\nm\n)\nTime (\ns\ns\n)\nDSVP\n1511\n​\n(\n±\n75\n)\n1511(\\pm 75)\n931\n​\n(\n±\n61\n)\n931(\\pm 61)\nTARE\n1209\n​\n(\n±\n42\n)\n1209(\\pm 42)\n658\n​\n(\n±\n23\n)\n658(\\pm 23)\nARiADNE\n1053\n​\n(\n±\n63\n)\n1053(\\pm 63)\n610\n​\n(\n±\n24\n)\n610(\\pm 24)\nHEADER\n1030\n​\n(\n±\n40\n)\n1030(\\pm 40)\n576\n​\n(\n±\n26\n)\n576(\\pm 26)\nFARE\n1048\n​\n(\n±\n13\n)\n\\textbf{1048}(\\pm 13)\n590\n​\n(\n±\n10\n)\n\\textbf{590}(\\pm 10)\n(b)\nForest\nDistance (\nm\nm\n)\nTime (\ns\ns\n)\nDSVP\n2058\n​\n(\n±\n92\n)\n2058(\\pm 92)\n1083\n​\n(\n±\n60\n)\n1083(\\pm 60)\nTARE\n1363\n​\n(\n±\n43\n)\n1363(\\pm 43)\n711\n​\n(\n±\n21\n)\n711(\\pm 21)\nARiADNE\n1320\n​\n(\n±\n81\n)\n1320(\\pm 81)\n790\n​\n(\n±\n62\n)\n790(\\pm 62)\nHEADER\n1230\n​\n(\n±\n72\n)\n1230(\\pm 72)\n725\n​\n(\n±\n36\n)\n725(\\pm 36)\nFARE\n1090\n​\n(\n±\n21\n)\n\\textbf{1090}(\\pm 21)\n680\n​\n(\n±\n10\n)\n\\textbf{680}(\\pm 10)\n(c)\nWarehouse\nDistance (\nm\nm\n)\nTime (\ns\ns\n)\nDSVP\n869\n​\n(\n±\n42\n)\n869(\\pm 42)\n582\n​\n(\n±\n32\n)\n582(\\pm 32)\nTARE\n652\n​\n(\n±\n31\n)\n652(\\pm 31)\n366\n​\n(\n±\n22\n)\n366(\\pm 22)\nARiADNE\n521\n​\n(\n±\n16\n)\n521(\\pm 16)\n362\n​\n(\n±\n40\n)\n362(\\pm 40)\nHEADER\n492\n​\n(\n±\n17\n)\n492(\\pm 17)\n286\n​\n(\n±\n16\n)\n286(\\pm 16)\nFARE\n441\n​\n(\n±\n15\n)\n\\textbf{441}(\\pm 15)\n252\n​\n(\n±\n8\n)\n\\textbf{252}(\\pm 8)\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFigure 3\n:\nDemonstration of the exploration trajectories output by FARE in both indoor and outdoor Gazebo simulations. The Trajectory is color-coded to represent the robot’s movement over time.\nwhich yields\nr\nt\ndev\n∈\n[\n−\n1\n,\n0\n]\nr_{t}^{\\text{dev}}\\in[-1,0]\n. This formulation assigns mild penalties for small deviations while increasingly suppressing large deviations from the global guidance, providing smooth and stable gradients for policy optimization. By this construction, the waypoint deviation\nd\nt\nd_{t}\nis monotonically related to detours from the global path. Therefore, minimizing the cumulative instruction-following penalty implicitly encourages shorter executed trajectories, while remaining fully compatible with efficient reinforcement learning.\nV\nExperiments\nWe conduct a set of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of FARE. We first perform comparative evaluations in Gazebo simulation across three representative environments—\nindoor\n,\nforest\n, and\nwarehouse\n—to assess exploration performance under diverse structural characteristics. We then deploy FARE on a real mobile robot and validate its performance in a large-scale campus environment. All experiments use the same trained model and identical system configurations unless otherwise specified.\nV-A\nComparison Analysis\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFigure 4\n:\nValidations of FARE in real-world scenarios on a wheeled robot.\nWe integrate FARE into the robot operating system (ROS) and compare it with representative state-of-the-art exploration planners, including\nTARE\n[\n4\n]\n,\nDSVP\n[\n29\n]\n,\nARiADNE\n[\n7\n]\nand\nHEADER\n[\n6\n]\n. For a fair comparison, ARiADNE is implemented with the same graph rarefaction strategy as in\n[\n7\n]\n, and all graph-related settings are kept consistent across methods.\nThe comparison is conducted in Gazebo simulation across three benchmark environments: an\nindoor\nenvironment, a\nforest\nenvironment, and a\nwarehouse\nenvironment. All experiments are performed on a four-wheeled differential-drive robot equipped with a 16-channel 3D LiDAR, with a maximum speed of\n2\n​\nm\n/\ns\n2\\,\\mathrm{m/s}\n.\nFor different environments, FARE only adjusts the node resolution parameter\nΔ\nnode\n\\Delta_{\\text{node}}\n, which is varied from\n1.2\n​\nm\n1.2\\,\\mathrm{m}\nto\n2.8\n​\nm\n2.8\\,\\mathrm{m}\n. The baseline planners generally require tuning of multiple parameters to achieve their best performance.\nIn addition, FARE is provided with a short environment description specific to each benchmark environment to condition the generation of the exploration strategy, with the slow-thinking module instantiated as\nQwen3-14B\n. The environment descriptions are as follows: Indoor—modern indoor office building with long corridors, meeting rooms, and cubicle areas; Forest—outdoor forest environment with natural obstacles, trees, and uneven terrain; and Warehouse—indoor warehouse composed of densely arranged box stacks forming narrow aisles.\nEach method is executed for 10 runs per environment. Travel distance and explored volume are reported in Fig.\n2\n, and quantitative results are summarized in Table\nI\n.\nFARE achieves performance on par with other baselines in the indoor environment, where the environment is compact and lacks distinctive global-level structure. In the forest environment, FARE achieves a clear reduction in travel distance and makespan, and this advantage further widens in the warehouse environment, where FARE obtains the shortest paths and fastest completion times among all methods. Specifically, as illustrated by the trajectory visualizations in Fig.\n3\n, FARE does not rely solely on local frontier or utility signals. Instead, it systematically incorporates global structural cues during exploration. After reaching the boundary of the explored region, FARE tends to complete peripheral and corner areas early, rather than postponing them. In contrast, baseline methods often defer these regions and revisit them later, resulting in additional backtracking and reduced overall efficiency.\nWe attribute FARE’s performance gains to two key factors. First, our hierarchical design enables environment-adaptive planning, allowing FARE to adjust its global exploration strategy according to the environment character. Second, effective coordination between global guidance and local execution allows the agent to balance long-horizon objectives with local reactivity. The slow-thinking module provide global direction, while the fast-thinking module remain flexible to exploit nearby informative regions.\nV-B\nHardware Validation\nWe validate\nFARE\non an Agilex Scout-mini wheeled robot equipped with an onboard\nJetson AGX Orin\n, which runs the LLM-based slow-thinking module using\nQwen3-14B\n. An Ouster OS0-32 LiDAR is used for perception, and FastLIO2\n[\n25\n]\nprovides odometry and mapping. For all experiments, the maximum robot speed is set to\n1\n​\nm\n/\ns\n1\\,\\mathrm{m/s}\n, the sensor range to\n8\n​\nm\n8\\,\\mathrm{m}\n, and the fast-thinking module replanning frequency to\n1\n​\nHz\n1\\,\\mathrm{Hz}\n.\nReal-world validation is conducted in a\n200\n​\nm\n×\n130\n​\nm\n200m\\times 130m\nindoor teaching building\non campus. The environment consists of long corridors, rooms, and intersections, posing challenges in global reasoning and long-horizon exploration. We set the map resolution to\nΔ\nmap\n=\n0.4\n​\nm\n\\Delta_{\\text{map}}=0.4\\,\\mathrm{m}\nand the node resolution to\nΔ\nnode\n=\n0.8\n​\nm\n\\Delta_{\\text{node}}=0.8\\,\\mathrm{m}\n. These parameters are selected prior to deployment and remain fixed throughout the experiment.\nDuring deployment,\nFARE\nsuccessfully explores the entire building without manual intervention. The system maintains stable runtime performance during global guidance generation and local policy execution. This hardware experiment demonstrates that\nFARE\ncan effectively operate with onboard LLM inference and transfer from simulation to real-world environments.\nVI\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this work, we propose FARE, a hierarchical autonomous exploration framework that separates environment-conditioned global reasoning from fast local decision-making. FARE translates concise natural language environment descriptions into structured, interpretable exploration strategies, and performs LLM-based graph reasoning on a pruned global belief graph to generate adaptive global guidance. A fast-thinking policy integrates local graph structure, utility signals, and global paths, and is explicitly trained to follow long-horizon guidance while retaining local flexibility. Together, these components enable coherent exploration behaviors that reduce redundant backtracking and improve efficiency, as validated in both simulation and real-world experiments.\nFuture work will extend FARE to multi-robot exploration with explicit inter-agent coordination, and incorporate vision-based semantic perception to enable online detection of environment changes, better supporting hybrid environments with abrupt scene-type transitions. We also plan to investigate richer environment representations and three-dimensional action spaces to further enhance generality.\nReferences\n[1]\nM. Besta, N. Blach, A. Kubicek, R.

    "preview_text": "This work advances autonomous robot exploration by integrating agent-level semantic reasoning with fast local control. We introduce FARE, a hierarchical autonomous exploration framework that integrates a large language model (LLM) for global reasoning with a reinforcement learning (RL) policy for local decision making. FARE follows a fast-slow thinking paradigm. The slow-thinking LLM module interprets a concise textual description of the unknown environment and synthesizes an agent-level exploration strategy, which is then grounded into a sequence of global waypoints through a topological graph. To further improve reasoning efficiency, this module employs a modularity-based pruning mechanism that reduces redundant graph structures. The fast-thinking RL module executes exploration by reacting to local observations while being guided by the LLM-generated global waypoints. The RL policy is additionally shaped by a reward term that encourages adherence to the global waypoints, enabling coherent and robust closed-loop behavior.

            "answer": "## 论文主要局限性分析\n\n基于对论文内容的分析，FARE框架虽然取得了显著成果，但仍存在以下主要局限性：\n\n### 技术层面\n- **环境描述依赖人工输入**：慢思考模块（LLM）的推理依赖于**人工提供的简洁文本环境描述**（如“现代室内办公楼”、“户外森林环境”）。这在实际完全未知的环境中可能不现实或需要额外感知模块自动生成描述。\n- **计算开销与实时性**：使用Qwen3-14B等大型语言模型进行**迭代式图推理**可能带来显著的计算延迟，尽管论文提及保持了稳定运行时性能，但在资源受限的嵌入式平台（如机器人）上大规模部署仍具挑战性。\n- **表示与动作空间限制**：\n    - 环境表示为**二维占据栅格**，未充分利用三维几何或语义信息。\n    - 动作空间基于**图节点选择**，未扩展到连续或更复杂的运动控制。\n- **泛化与自适应能力**：策略在训练后固定，**无法在线适应环境类型的突变**（如从走廊突然进入开阔大厅）。LLM的策略生成基于初始描述，可能无法响应探索过程中发现的新结构特征。\n\n### 算法与集成层面\n- **奖励设计的潜在短视性**：快速思考模块的奖励包含**指令跟随奖励**，虽鼓励遵循全局路径，但可能抑制对意外局部机遇（如新发现捷径）的利用，需在“遵循”与“灵活”间精细平衡。\n- **图构建与修剪的启发式**：全局信念图的构建依赖**模块度修剪**，保留Top-k社区。这种启发式可能在某些环境结构下丢弃重要信息，且参数k需预设。\n- **单一机器人设定**：框架目前仅针对**单机器人探索**，未考虑多机器人协同中的通信、任务分配与冲突避免问题。\n\n---\n\n## 未来可能的改进方向\n\n论文在结论与未来工作中已明确指出以下几个方向，结合分析可进一步扩展：\n\n### 1. 多机器人探索扩展\n- 在框架中引入**显式的智能体间协调机制**，例如通过LLM进行分布式策略协商或全局任务分解，以提升大范围环境的并行探索效率。\n\n### 2. 感知与描述的自动化\n- 集成**视觉语义感知模块**，实现**在线环境描述生成**。例如，使用VLM（视觉语言模型）实时分析场景，自动生成或更新用于LLM推理的文本描述，减少对先验知识的依赖。\n- 探索**多模态环境表示**，融合几何、纹理与语义信息，使策略能理解“房间”、“门”、“走廊”等高级概念。\n\n### 3. 三维与动态环境适应\n- 将表示扩展至**三维体素地图或点云图**，并设计相应的三维图推理与动作空间，以支持无人机或复杂地形下的探索。\n- 增强框架对**动态变化环境**（如移动障碍物、临时封闭区域）的在线适应能力，可能通过在线重规划或动态图更新实现。\n\n### 4. 算法效率与鲁棒性提升\n- 优化LLM推理效率，研究**轻量化模型微调**、**推理加速**（如模型蒸馏、专用硬件）或**缓存机制**，以提升实时性。\n- 设计更**自适应**的图修剪与表示方法，使图结构能根据环境复杂度动态调整，避免信息丢失。\n- 强化**奖励塑造**，探索如何让指令跟随奖励更好地与长期探索收益结合，避免局部最优。\n\n### 5. 仿真到实物的泛化强化\n- 在更多样化的仿真环境（包括极端结构、光照变化、传感器噪声）中进行**大规模训练与测试**，提升策略的泛化能力。\n- 研究**域自适应技术**，缩小仿真与真实世界在传感器模型、动力学等方面的差距。\n\n```plaintext\n核心改进逻辑链：\n人工描述 → 自动语义感知 → 多模态表示\n单机器人 → 多机器人协同 → 分布式优化\n二维固定环境 → 三维动态环境 → 在线适应\nLLM离线推理 → 轻量化/加速 → 实时闭环决策\n```\n\n这些改进方向旨在使FARE框架更具**自主性、适应性、扩展性和实用性**，从而更好地应对复杂、大规模、动态的真实世界探索任务。",
