By combining powerful vision-language backbones with flow matching or diffusion-based action generation, these models have achieved impressive success across diverse tasks. However, recent studies reveal concerning fragility: performance degrades substantially under modest distribution shifts such as lighting changes, texture variations, or camera angle perturbations\n[\n2\n,\n4\n]\n. This problem is particularly pronounced on complex tasks where sequential decisions compound, and errors in early steps cascade into failure.\nThe fundamental question is whether the learned representations robustly capture task-relevant semantics or inadvertently encode spurious patterns. Flow matching provides an elegant framework for learning action distributions by regressing neural vector fields\n[\n5\n,\n3\n]\n, yet the regression objective alone may not sufficiently incentivize semantically grounded representations. We propose a complementary perspective: the geometric relationship between observation features and action embeddings reveals representational quality. When observation features from the vision-language backbone and action embeddings from the policy head exhibit low distributional discrepancy, their representations are geometrically compatible, suggesting semantic coherence. Conversely, high discrepancy signals potential misalignment that may indicate spurious patterns or out-of-distribution observations.\nTo solve this problem, we introduce the\nDiG-Flow\nframework with 3 main components: a discrepancy function that quantifies distributional distance, a monotone weight mapping that transforms discrepancy into a modulation factor, and a lightweight residual operator that adjusts observation features. The framework defaults to Wasserstein distance for its geometric interpretability but accommodates alternative discrepancies. Importantly,\nDiG-Flow\nintervenes at the representation level before flow matching, leaving the probability path and target vector field unchanged. This design enables seamless integration into existing architectures while providing theoretical guarantees on training dynamics and inference convergence.\nOur contributions are threefold. First, we establish a discrepancy-guided framework for robust VLA learning. Second, we discuss theoretical motivation for the general problem and provide theoretical guarantee for our method design. Third, we validate that\nDiG-Flow\nconsistently improves performance across both simulation and real-world benchmarks, with pronounced gains on complex multi-step tasks and in data-limited scenarios, while maintaining negligible computational overhead.\n2\nRelated Work\nVision-Language-Action Models.\nVision Language Models (VLMs)\n[\n6\n,\n7\n]\ntypically combine LLM reasoning\n[\n8\n,\n9\n,\n10\n]\nwith modal-specialized encoders\n[\n11\n,\n12\n,\n13\n,\n14\n]\nfor unified multimodal understanding\n[\n15\n,\n16\n]\n.\nPioneering works\n[\n17\n,\n18\n,\n19\n,\n20\n]\ndemonstrated strong few-shot instruction-following capability. With these visual backbones, VLA models extend them to generate robot actions from visual observations and language instructions, representing a paradigm shift in robot learning\n[\n1\n,\n21\n,\n2\n,\n3\n,\n22\n]\n. Early work like RT-1\n[\n1\n]\ndemonstrated transformer-based architectures could scale to diverse tasks, while RT-2\n[\n21\n]\nshowed web-scale vision-language pretraining improves robotic control. Recent advances follow two primary approaches: (1)\nDirect action prediction\n: OpenVLA\n[\n2\n]\nscales to 7B parameters with open-source datasets, Pi0\n[\n3\n]\nand its enhanced version Pi0.5\n[\n4\n]\nuse flow matching for continuous control, while models like Octo\n[\n23\n]\nprovide generalist policies across embodiments; (2)\nVisual prediction\n: PaLM-E\n[\n22\n]\nembeds sensors into language models, GR-3\n[\n24\n,\n25\n]\nuses video pretraining for action generation. Specialized variants address specific challenges: SpatialVLA\n[\n26\n]\nincorporates 3D spatial representations, Otter builds fine-grained visual feature extraction\n[\n27\n]\n, Pi0-Fast\n[\n28\n]\nimproves inference efficiency through action tokenization, gr00t-N1\n[\n29\n]\ntargets humanoid control, and CoT-VLA\n[\n30\n]\nadds visual chain-of-thought reasoning. Being-H0\n[\n31\n]\nincorporates physical instruction tuning for better motion understanding. OneTwoVLA proposes a unified architecture for better adaptive reasoning\n[\n32\n]\n. Despite these advances, long-horizon performance and robustness to distributional drift remain open challenges, which we address through geometric regularization.\nFlow Matching and Optimal Transport.\nFlow Matching\n[\n5\n]\ntrains neural ODEs without simulation, directly learning vector fields that transform distributions. This paradigm improves on Continuous Normalizing Flows\n[\n33\n,\n34\n,\n35\n]\nwhich require expensive ODE solving. Recent developments include Conditional Flow Matching\n[\n36\n]\nfor simplified training with conditional distributions, Rectified Flow\n[\n37\n]\nfor straighter transport paths, and Stochastic Interpolants\n[\n38\n]\nunifying flows and diffusions. OT-CFM\n[\n39\n,\n40\n]\nuses optimal transport for trajectory optimization, finding better paths between distributions at the level of flow matching dynamics.\nOptimal transport theory\n[\n41\n,\n42\n]\nprovides principled tools for comparing distributions geometrically. Computational advances have made OT practical for machine learning: Sinkhorn distances\n[\n43\n]\nadd entropic regularization for efficient approximation, while Sliced Wasserstein\n[\n44\n,\n45\n]\nprojects to 1D for linear complexity in the number of samples. Our key innovation differs from prior OT applications in VLA: rather than using optimal transport to modify the flow matching trajectory (as in OT-CFM), we use Wasserstein distance as an\nauxiliary signal\nto modulate representation learning. This representation-side intervention complements the flow matching objective and enables robustness to distributional drift without altering the fundamental action generation dynamics.\nRobustness in Robot Learning.\nRobustness to distribution shift and spurious correlations has been studied across robot learning contexts\n[\n46\n]\n. Domain randomization techniques\n[\n47\n]\nattempt to improve generalization by training under diverse conditions, while domain adaptation methods\n[\n48\n]\nexplicitly align distributions between source and target environments. Recent work has explored ways to identify and mitigate reliance on spurious features through causal reasoning\n[\n49\n]\nor by learning invariant representations\n[\n50\n]\n. However, these approaches typically operate during training data collection\n[\n51\n]\nor through architectural constraints, rather than providing adaptive mechanisms that respond to distributional drift during deployment. Our geometric modulation approach offers a complementary perspective: by dynamically measuring and responding to observation-action alignment through Wasserstein distance, we enable the model to adjust its behavior as it encounters distributional shift in long-horizon tasks.\n3\nPreliminaries\nFigure 1\n:\nOverview of\nDiG-Flow\nand integration of the\nDiG-Block\n.\n(a)\nWe attach the\nDiG-Block\nin the pretrained VLM backbone. Observations are projected into a shared discrepancy space (\nobs proj.\n), while ground-truth (for training) or predicted actions (for inference) are mapped into the same space (\nact proj.\n).\nFrom these two streams, the block estimates a transport-aware discrepancy\nD\nD\nand converts it into a gate\ng\n=\nϕ\n​\n(\nD\n)\ng=\\phi(D)\n, which softly modulates the backbone features before they are passed to the flow-matching action head.\nThe flow-matching head produces action trajectories from noise as in standard VLA models, and the\nDiG-Refine\nmodule can apply a small number of refinement steps entirely within the action head to further polish the predicted actions.\n(b)\nGiven input embeddings, the backbone first applies standard attention.\nThe post-attention features are then normalized and fed to\nDiG-Block\n, which uses the act/obs projections to compute\nD\n​\n(\nμ\nH\n,\nμ\nZ\n)\nD(\\mu_{H},\\mu_{Z})\nand a gate\ng\ng\n, and performs a gated residual update.\nThis design allows\nDiG-Flow\nto modulate the high-level representation using discrepancy signals from actions, while keeping the pretrained backbone architecture and attention blocks intact.\nWe establish notation and background in this section.\nFlow Matching.\nFlow matching learns a time-dependent vector field\nv\nθ\n​\n(\nx\n,\nt\n)\nv_{\\theta}(x,t)\nfor\nt\n∈\n[\n0\n,\n1\n]\nt\\in[0,1]\nthat transports a base distribution\np\n0\np_{0}\nto a data distribution\np\n1\np_{1}\nvia the ODE:\nd\n​\nx\nt\nd\n​\nt\n=\nv\nθ\n​\n(\nx\nt\n,\nt\n)\n,\nx\n0\n∼\np\n0\n.\n\\frac{dx_{t}}{dt}=v_{\\theta}(x_{t},t),x_{0}\\sim p_{0}.\nTraining minimizes the squared regression loss against a target vector field\nv\n⋆\nv^{\\star}\n:\nℒ\n​\n(\nθ\n)\n=\n𝔼\nt\n,\nx\n1\n,\nx\n0\n​\n[\n‖\nv\nθ\n​\n(\nx\nt\n,\nt\n)\n−\nv\n⋆\n​\n(\nx\nt\n,\nt\n)\n‖\n2\n]\n,\n\\mathcal{L}(\\theta)=\\mathbb{E}_{t,x_{1},x_{0}}\\big[\\|v_{\\theta}(x_{t},t)-v^{\\star}(x_{t},t)\\|^{2}\\big],\n(1)\nwhere\nx\nt\nx_{t}\ninterpolates between\nx\n0\n∼\np\n0\nx_{0}\\sim p_{0}\nand\nx\n1\n∼\np\n1\nx_{1}\\sim p_{1}\nalong a chosen probability path.\nVLA Architecture and Action Chunks.\nA VLA model processes multimodal observations\no\n=\n(\no\nvis\n,\no\nlang\n,\no\nprop\n)\no=(o_{\\text{vis}},o_{\\text{lang}},o_{\\text{prop}})\ncomprising visual images, language instructions, and proprioceptive states. A vision-language backbone produces observation features:\nH\n=\n(\nh\n1\n,\n…\n,\nh\nT\n)\n∈\nℝ\nT\n×\nd\nH=(h_{1},\\ldots,h_{T})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{T\\times d}\n, where\nT\nT\nis the context length and\nd\nd\nis the feature dimension. Current VLA implementations typically adopt an action chunk formulation: at decision time\nt\nt\n, the policy predicts a sequence of future actions:\na\nt\n:\nt\n+\nK\n−\n1\n=\n(\na\nt\n,\na\nt\n+\n1\n,\n…\n,\na\nt\n+\nK\n−\n1\n)\n∈\nℝ\nK\n×\nd\na\n,\na_{t:t+K-1}=(a_{t},a_{t+1},\\ldots,a_{t+K-1})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{K\\times d_{a}},\n(2)\nwhere\nK\nK\nis the action horizon and\nd\na\nd_{a}\nis the raw action dimension. After executing this chunk, the model re-observes the environment at time\nt\n+\nK\nt+K\nand generates a new chunk, making the policy effectively memoryless between chunks. Flow matching generates these action chunks by conditioning the vector field on observation features:\nv\nθ\n​\n(\nx\n,\nt\n|\nH\n)\nv_{\\theta}(x,t|H)\n.\nAction Embeddings.\nTo enable geometric comparison between observations and actions, we map raw actions to a latent space via an encoder\nf\n:\nℝ\nd\na\n→\nℝ\nd\nf:\\mathbb{R}^{d_{a}}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{d}\n. For a raw action\na\nt\na_{t}\n, we obtain an action embedding:\nz\nt\n=\nf\n​\n(\na\nt\n)\n∈\nℝ\nd\n.\nz_{t}=f(a_{t})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d}.\nDuring training, ground-truth actions from the dataset are encoded to form ground-truth action embeddings\nz\nt\ngt\n=\nf\n​\n(\na\nt\ngt\n)\nz_{t}^{\\text{gt}}=f(a_{t}^{\\text{gt}})\n. During inference, predicted actions are encoded as\nz\n^\nt\n=\nf\n​\n(\na\n^\nt\n)\n\\hat{z}_{t}=f(\\hat{a}_{t})\n. Collecting embeddings over the chunk horizon yields:\nZ\n=\n(\nz\n1\n,\n…\n,\nz\nK\n)\n∈\nℝ\nK\n×\nd\n.\nZ=(z_{1},\\ldots,z_{K})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{K\\times d}.\nThe encoder\nf\nf\nis implemented as a lightweight linear projection and trained jointly with the policy. This design allows observations\nH\nH\nand action embeddings\nZ\nZ\nto reside in a common feature space where geometric comparisons are meaningful.\nGiven feature sequences\nH\n∈\nℝ\nT\n×\nd\nH\\in\\mathbb{R}^{T\\times d}\nand\nZ\n∈\nℝ\nK\n×\nd\nZ\\in\\mathbb{R}^{K\\times d}\n, we form empirical distributions:\nμ\nH\n=\n1\nT\n​\n∑\ni\n=\n1\nT\nδ\nh\ni\n,\nμ\nZ\n=\n1\nK\n​\n∑\nj\n=\n1\nK\nδ\nz\nj\n,\n\\mu_{H}=\\frac{1}{T}\\sum_{i=1}^{T}\\delta_{h_{i}},\\quad\\mu_{Z}=\\frac{1}{K}\\sum_{j=1}^{K}\\delta_{z_{j}},\n(3)\nwhere\nδ\nx\n\\delta_{x}\ndenotes a Dirac mass at\nx\nx\n. These distributions enable us to quantify the geometric relationship between observations and actions via distributional discrepancy measures.\n4\nMethod\nWe present\nDiG-Flow\n, a framework for enhancing VLA robustness through geometric regularization of representations. Figure\n1\n(a) shows the overall structure: a pretrained vision-language backbone produces multimodal observation tokens, a lightweight\nDiG-Block\nsits at the interface between the backbone and the flow-matching head, and an optional\nDiG-Refine\nmodule operates purely inside the action expert head.\n4.1\nDiscrepancy-guided architecture\nDiscrepancy Function.\nWe define a discrepancy function\nD\n:\n𝒫\n​\n(\nℝ\nd\n)\n×\n𝒫\n​\n(\nℝ\nd\n)\n→\nℝ\n+\nD:\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{R}^{d})\\times\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{R}^{d})\\to\\mathbb{R}_{+}\nthat quantifies the geometric distance between probability distributions. Our default choice is the squared 2-Wasserstein distance:\nD\n​\n(\nμ\nH\n,\nμ\nZ\n)\n=\ninf\nγ\n∈\nΓ\n​\n(\nμ\nH\n,\nμ\nZ\n)\n∫\n‖\nx\n−\ny\n‖\n2\n​\n𝑑\nγ\n​\n(\nx\n,\ny\n)\n,\nD(\\mu_{H},\\mu_{Z})=\\inf_{\\gamma\\in\\Gamma(\\mu_{H},\\mu_{Z})}\\int\\|x-y\\|^{2}\\,d\\gamma(x,y),\n(4)\nwhere\nΓ\n​\n(\nμ\nH\n,\nμ\nZ\n)\n\\Gamma(\\mu_{H},\\mu_{Z})\ndenotes the set of couplings between\nμ\nH\n\\mu_{H}\nand\nμ\nZ\n\\mu_{Z}\n. The Wasserstein distance provides a geometrically meaningful measure of distributional alignment: lower transport cost indicates that observation and action representations are compatible, while higher cost suggests potential misalignment.\nFor computational efficiency, we approximate\nW\n2\n2\nW_{2}^{2}\nusing the sliced Wasserstein distance. We sample\nM\nM\nrandom unit directions\nω\n1\n,\n…\n,\nω\nM\n∼\nUniform\n​\n(\n𝕊\nd\n−\n1\n)\n\\omega_{1},\\ldots,\\omega_{M}\\sim\\text{Uniform}(\\mathbb{S}^{d-1})\nand compute:\nD\n​\n(\nμ\nH\n,\nμ\nZ\n)\n≈\n1\nM\n​\n∑\nm\n=\n1\nM\nW\n2\n2\n​\n(\n(\nω\nm\n⊤\n)\n#\n​\nμ\nH\n,\n(\nω\nm\n⊤\n)\n#\n​\nμ\nZ\n)\n,\nD(\\mu_{H},\\mu_{Z})\\approx\\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{m=1}^{M}W_{2}^{2}\\big((\\omega_{m}^{\\top})_{\\#}\\mu_{H},(\\omega_{m}^{\\top})_{\\#}\\mu_{Z}\\big),\n(5)\nwhere\n(\nω\nm\n⊤\n)\n#\n​\nμ\n(\\omega_{m}^{\\top})_{\\#}\\mu\ndenotes the pushforward of\nμ\n\\mu\nunder projection onto\nω\nm\n\\omega_{m}\n. Each 1D Wasserstein distance is computed via the quantile formula:\nW\n2\n2\n​\n(\n(\nω\nm\n⊤\n)\n#\n​\nμ\nH\n,\n(\nω\nm\n⊤\n)\n#\n​\nμ\nZ\n)\n=\n∫\n0\n1\n|\nF\nH\n−\n1\n​\n(\nu\n)\n−\nF\nZ\n−\n1\n​\n(\nu\n)\n|\n2\n​\n𝑑\nu\n,\nW_{2}^{2}\\big((\\omega_{m}^{\\top})_{\\#}\\mu_{H},(\\omega_{m}^{\\top})_{\\#}\\mu_{Z}\\big)=\\int_{0}^{1}|F_{H}^{-1}(u)-F_{Z}^{-1}(u)|^{2}du,\n(6)\nwhich reduces to sorting projected features and computing mean squared differences. Alternative discrepancies such as Sinkhorn divergence, maximum mean discrepancy, or cosine distance can be substituted within the same framework.\nWeight Mapping.\nWe map the discrepancy to a modulation weight via a monotone decreasing function\nϕ\n:\nℝ\n+\n→\n[\ng\nmin\n,\n1\n]\n\\phi:\\mathbb{R}_{+}\\to[g_{\\min},1]\n.\nConcretely, we use an exponentially decaying map with a lower clip:\ng\n=\nϕ\n​\n(\nD\n)\n=\nmax\n⁡\n{\ng\nmin\n,\nexp\n⁡\n(\n−\nτ\n​\nD\n)\n}\n,\ng=\\phi(D)=\\max\\{g_{\\min},\\exp(-\\tau D)\\},\n(7)\nwhere\nτ\n>\n0\n\\tau>0\nis a temperature parameter and\ng\nmin\n∈\n(\n0\n,\n1\n)\ng_{\\min}\\in(0,1)\nprevents the gate from vanishing even for large discrepancies.\nLow-discrepancy (well-aligned) pairs thus receive weights close to\n1\n1\n, while high-discrepancy pairs are down-weighted but still retain a non-zero contribution.\nThe map\nϕ\n\\phi\nis monotone decreasing and Lipschitz continuous, matching Assumption\n8.1\n.\nResidual Operator.\nWe define a lightweight residual operator\nℛ\n:\nℝ\nT\n×\nd\n→\nℝ\nT\n×\nd\n\\mathcal{R}:\\mathbb{R}^{T\\times d}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{T\\times d}\nthat transforms observation features.

Some of these solutions correspond to semantically meaningful alignments between observations and actions (\nblue\ndistribution), while others exploit spurious correlations or shortcuts (\nred\ndistribution).\nDiG-Flow\nmeasures the Wasserstein distance\nD\nD\nbetween observation and action features to distinguish these pathways.

In this way,\nDiG-Flow\npushes more intelligence toward the foundation model\n, making VLAs generate more robust actions for general manipulation.\nThe previous subsection establishes that the gated objective\nJ\n​\n(\nθ\n)\nJ(\\theta)\nis smooth, that the residual update yields improvement for\nλ\n\\lambda\nin a nontrivial interval, and that the refinement field defines a contraction. We now give a more explicit intuition in terms of how the discrepancy-controlled gate with above properties reshapes the loss landscape.\nDataset decomposition by discrepancy.\nLet\nD\n​\n(\nH\n,\nZ\n)\nD(H,Z)\ndenote the discrepancy between observation features and action embeddings for a particular sample, and let\ng\n=\nϕ\n​\n(\nD\n)\ng=\\phi(D)\nwith\nϕ\n\\phi\nmonotone decreasing. Consider partitioning the dataset into two regions:\n𝒜\n\\displaystyle\\mathcal{A}\n=\n{\n(\nH\n,\nZ\n)\n:\nD\n​\n(\nH\n,\nZ\n)\n≤\nδ\n}\n(geometrically aligned)\n,\n\\displaystyle=\\{(H,Z):D(H,Z)\\leq\\delta\\}\\quad\\text{(geometrically aligned)},\n(19)\n𝒮\n\\displaystyle\\mathcal{S}\n=\n{\n(\nH\n,\nZ\n)\n:\nD\n​\n(\nH\n,\nZ\n)\n>\nδ\n}\n(geometrically misaligned / shortcut-like)\n,\n\\displaystyle=\\{(H,Z):D(H,Z)>\\delta\\}\\quad\\text{(geometrically misaligned / shortcut-like)},\n(20)\nfor some threshold\nδ\n>\n0\n\\delta>0\n.

Thus, even if the raw gradients\n𝔼\n​\n[\n∇\nθ\nℓ\n∣\n𝒜\n]\n\\mathbb{E}[\\nabla_{\\theta}\\ell\\mid\\mathcal{A}]\nand\n𝔼\n​\n[\n∇\nθ\nℓ\n∣\n𝒮\n]\n\\mathbb{E}[\\nabla_{\\theta}\\ell\\mid\\mathcal{S}]\nhave comparable magnitudes, the effective contributions to the gated gradient in (\n24\n) are reweighted by the expected gates. As optimization proceeds,\nJ\n​\n(\nθ\n)\nJ(\\theta)\ntherefore behaves as if it were more strongly influenced by the aligned region\n𝒜\n\\mathcal{A}\nand less by the shortcut region\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\n.\nConnection to the residual update condition.\nThe residual update analysis for Theorem\n5.1\nuses the alignment condition\n𝔼\n​\n[\ng\n​\n⟨\n∇\nH\nℓ\n​\n(\nθ\n;\nH\n,\nt\n)\n,\nℛ\n​\n(\nH\n)\n⟩\n]\n≤\n−\nα\n0\n.\n\\mathbb{E}\\big[g\\,\\langle\\nabla_{H}\\ell(\\theta;H,t),\\mathcal{R}(H)\\rangle\\big]\\;\\leq\\;-\\alpha_{0}.\n(26)\nUsing the same decomposition\n𝒜\n∪\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{A}\\cup\\mathcal{S}\n, this can be rewritten as\np\n𝒜\n​\n𝔼\n​\n[\ng\n​\n⟨\n∇\nH\nℓ\n​\n(\nθ\n;\nH\n,\nt\n)\n,\nℛ\n​\n(\nH\n)\n⟩\n∣\n𝒜\n]\n+\np\n𝒮\n​\n𝔼\n​\n[\ng\n​\n⟨\n∇\nH\nℓ\n​\n(\nθ\n;\nH\n,\nt\n)\n,\nℛ\n​\n(\nH\n)\n⟩\n∣\n𝒮\n]\n≤\n−\nα\n0\n.\np_{\\mathcal{A}}\\,\\mathbb{E}\\big[g\\,\\langle\\nabla_{H}\\ell(\\theta;H,t),\\mathcal{R}(H)\\rangle\\mid\\mathcal{A}\\big]+p_{\\mathcal{S}}\\,\\mathbb{E}\\big[g\\,\\langle\\nabla_{H}\\ell(\\theta;H,t),\\mathcal{R}(H)\\rangle\\mid\\mathcal{S}\\big]\\leq-\\alpha_{0}.\n(27)\nIf the residual operator\nℛ\n\\mathcal{R}\nis designed to follow the descent direction of the flow-matching loss on aligned samples (so that\n𝔼\n​\n[\n⟨\n∇\nH\nℓ\n,\nℛ\n​\n(\nH\n)\n⟩\n∣\n𝒜\n]\n<\n0\n\\mathbb{E}[\\langle\\nabla_{H}\\ell,\\mathcal{R}(H)\\rangle\\mid\\mathcal{A}]<0\n), then the gate\ng\ng\nfurther amplifies these contributions relative to those from\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\n. Intuitively, the residual update “trusts” the directions suggested by geometrically consistent pairs and downweights those arising from high-discrepancy configurations. This is exactly the intuition formalized in Theorem\n5.1\n: for small enough\nλ\n\\lambda\n, the first-order improvement from aligned regions dominates the second-order smoothness penalty.\nRefinement as gated fixed-point iteration.\nFinally, the refinement operator\nT\n​\n(\nZ\n)\n=\nZ\n−\nα\n​\nE\n​\n(\nZ\n;\ng\n)\nT(Z)=Z-\\alpha\\,E(Z;g)\ncan be viewed as a fixed-point iteration on the space of action embeddings. Under strong monotonicity and Lipschitz regularity, Theorem\n5.1\nshows that\nT\nT\nis a contraction. In practice, this means that once the gate\ng\ng\nhas identified “reliable” observation–action configurations, the refinement map can iteratively pull predicted actions toward a geometry-consistent fixed point\nZ\n⋆\nZ^{\\star}\nwithout exploding or oscillating. The contraction rate\nρ\n<\n1\n\\rho<1\nquantifies how quickly refinement concentrates probability mass around\nZ\n⋆\nZ^{\\star}\n.\nFigure\n3\nsummarizes the overall picture: discrepancy-guided gating reshapes the effective gradient contributions of different regions of the data space, the residual update exploits this reweighting to improve features in a controlled range of strengths, and the refinement operator provides a stable way to further align actions with observation geometry at inference time.\n5.3\nApproximation stability of transport-based discrepancy\nFinally, we discuss how the theoretical guarantees behave when the exact 2-Wasserstein distance is replaced by practical approximations such as sliced Wasserstein or Sinkhorn divergence.\nSliced Wasserstein concentration.\nAssume that observation and action embeddings lie in a bounded ball of radius\nR\nR\nin\nℝ\nd\n\\mathbb{R}^{d}\n. For each random projection direction\nω\nm\n∈\n𝕊\nd\n−\n1\n\\omega_{m}\\in\\mathbb{S}^{d-1}\n, the corresponding one-dimensional Wasserstein distance between the projected empirical measures is bounded by\n(\n2\n​\nR\n)\n2\n(2R)^{2}\n. The sliced Wasserstein estimator averages\nM\nM\nsuch terms, so by Hoeffding’s inequality, for any\nϵ\n>\n0\n\\epsilon>0\n,\nPr\n⁡\n[\n|\nD\n^\n−\n𝔼\n​\n[\nD\n^\n]\n|\n>\nϵ\n]\n≤\n2\n​\nexp\n⁡\n(\n−\nM\n​\nϵ\n2\n2\n⋅\n(\n2\n​\nR\n)\n4\n)\n.\n\\Pr\\!\\big[\\,|\\widehat{D}-\\mathbb{E}[\\widehat{D}]|>\\epsilon\\,\\big]\\;\\leq\\;2\\exp\\!\\Bigl(-\\frac{M\\epsilon^{2}}{2\\cdot(2R)^{4}}\\Bigr).\n(28)\nThus the estimation error scales as\nO\n​\n(\nM\n−\n1\n/\n2\n)\nO(M^{-1/2})\nwith high probability. Since the gate is obtained via a Lipschitz weight map\ng\n=\nϕ\n​\n(\nD\n)\ng=\\phi(D)\nwith constant\nL\nϕ\nL_{\\phi}\n(Assumption\n8.1\n), we have\n|\ng\n−\n𝔼\n​\n[\ng\n]\n|\n=\n|\nϕ\n​\n(\nD\n^\n)\n−\nϕ\n​\n(\n𝔼\n​\n[\nD\n^\n]\n)\n|\n≤\nL\nϕ\n​\n|\nD\n^\n−\n𝔼\n​\n[\nD\n^\n]\n|\n,\n|g-\\mathbb{E}[g]|\\;=\\;|\\phi(\\widehat{D})-\\phi(\\mathbb{E}[\\widehat{D}])|\\;\\leq\\;L_{\\phi}\\,|\\widehat{D}-\\mathbb{E}[\\widehat{D}]|,\n(29)\nso the gate error inherits the same\nO\n​\n(\nM\n−\n1\n/\n2\n)\nO(M^{-1/2})\nconcentration rate. In turn, the descent and contraction inequalities in Theorems\n5.1\n–\n5.1\nremain valid up to multiplicative constants that depend smoothly on\nL\nϕ\nL_{\\phi}\n.\nSinkhorn divergence.\nFor the Sinkhorn divergence\nS\nε\nS_{\\varepsilon}\nwith entropic regularization\nε\n>\n0\n\\varepsilon>0\n, standard results on entropic optimal transport show that\n|\nS\nε\n−\nW\n2\n2\n|\n≤\nb\n​\n(\nε\n)\n,\nb\n​\n(\nε\n)\n→\n0\n​\nas\n​\nε\n→\n0\n,\n\\big|S_{\\varepsilon}-W_{2}^{2}\\big|\\;\\leq\\;b(\\varepsilon),\\quad b(\\varepsilon)\\to 0\\text{ as }\\varepsilon\\to 0,\n(30)\nand empirical estimators of\nS\nε\nS_{\\varepsilon}\nconcentrate around their population values at rate\nO\n​\n(\nn\n−\n1\n/\n2\n)\nO(n^{-1/2})\nin the number of samples\nn\nn\n, with constants depending on\nε\n\\varepsilon\n. Propagating this perturbation through the Lipschitz map\nϕ\n\\phi\nagain yields a bounded perturbation of the gate:\n|\nϕ\n​\n(\nS\n^\nε\n)\n−\nϕ\n​\n(\nW\n2\n2\n)\n|\n≤\nL\nϕ\n​\n(\nb\n​\n(\nε\n)\n+\nC\n​\n(\nε\n)\n​\nn\n−\n1\n/\n2\n)\n,\n\\big|\\phi(\\widehat{S}_{\\varepsilon})-\\phi(W_{2}^{2})\\big|\\;\\leq\\;L_{\\phi}\\Bigl(b(\\varepsilon)+C(\\varepsilon)\\,n^{-1/2}\\Bigr),\n(31)\nfor some constant\nC\n​\n(\nε\n)\nC(\\varepsilon)\n. Consequently, using Sinkhorn divergence instead of exact Wasserstein distance only affects the numerical constants in our bounds; the qualitative guarantees (existence of a positive descent region in\nλ\n\\lambda\n, and contraction of the fixed-gate refinement) remain unchanged.\n6\nExperiments\nWe evaluate\nDiG-Flow\non challenging robotic manipulation benchmarks to assess its ability to improve robustness and generalization.\nOur experiments are designed to answer three questions:\n1.\nDoes discrepancy-guided flow matching improve VLA performance?\n2.\nHow does\nDiG-Flow\ncompare to state-of-the-art VLA baselines?\n3.\nWhich design choices of\nDiG-Flow\nare most important?\nTo demonstrate that\nDiG-Flow\nis backbone-agnostic, we select two of the most widely used flow-matching based VLA models,\ni.e\n.,\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n[\n4\n]\nand GR00T-N1\n[\n29\n]\n, as backbone architectures to evaluate the effectiveness of\nDiG-Flow\nacross different model designs. For\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n, we follow the official default configuration. We then insert\nDiG-Block\nbefore the final transformer layer of the VLM backbone, sharing the same observation features as the original policy head. For GR00T-N1, we use the standard tabletop configuration and insert\nDiG-Block\nat the final token representation used by the action head. In both models,\nDiG-Block\noperates purely at the representation level and does not modify the underlying flow-matching architecture or training objective. We refer to the two variants as\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n-\nDiG\nand GR00T-N1-\nDiG\n, respectively.\n6.1\nSimulation Experiments\n6.1.1\nExperimental Setup\nLIBERO Benchmark.\nLIBERO\n[\n52\n]\nis a standardized benchmark for tabletop robotic manipulation with language-conditioned tasks. It consists of four 10-task suites: LIBERO-Spatial (spatial reasoning and object placement), LIBERO-Object (diverse object properties and appearances), LIBERO-Goal (goal-conditioned instructions), and LIBERO-Long (long-horizon, multi-step tasks). Models are evaluated by success rate over 50 rollouts per task, following the official protocol.\nRoboCasa Benchmark.\nRoboCasa\n[\n53\n]\nis a scalable household robotics simulation platform built on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, providing photorealistic kitchen scenes and diverse manipulation tasks such as pick-and-place, opening cabinets, and interacting with appliances. We follow the 24 atomic manipulation tasks used in prior work on RoboCasa tabletop evaluation, which group naturally into three categories: (i) pick-and-place, (ii) opening and closing doors or drawers, and (iii) other manipulation skills such as pressing buttons or sliding objects. Each task comes with 50 human demonstrations and thousands of additional synthetic rollouts; to stress generalization in a low-data regime,\nwe train all models using only 50 demonstrations per task\n(one trajectory per demonstration), leaving the synthetic data unused.\nTraining details.\nUnless otherwise specified, we use the same optimizer and data pipeline as the corresponding backbone. For\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n-DiG on LIBERO, we train for 30K steps using AdamW with a global batch size of 256 across 8 A100 GPUs, a peak learning rate of\n5\n×\n10\n−\n5\n5\\times 10^{-5}\n, and cosine decay. The flow-matching head follows the standard squared regression loss and training-time enhancement. By default, our\nDiG-Block\nmodules use 32 sliced projections for the discrepancy, a temperature of\nτ\n=\n1.0\n\\tau=1.0\n, residual strength\nλ\n=\n0.4\n\\lambda=0.4\n, and a spectral norm bound of\nB\nℛ\n=\n2.0\nB_{\\mathcal{R}}=2.0\n. For GR00T-N1-\nDiG\n, we follow the official GR00T-N1 training and evaluation protocol and similarly enable\nDiG-Block\nduring fine-tuning.\n6.1.2\nMain Results on LIBERO\nTable\n1\nshows that\nDiG-Flow\nimproves both backbones and achieves state-of-the-art results on LIBERO.

This suite contains long-horizon, multi-step tasks, so the improvement supports our hypothesis that discrepancy-guided modulation reduces error accumulation by encouraging semantically aligned representations.\nTable 1\n:\nSuccess rates (%) on LIBERO.\nWe report mean success over 50 evaluation episodes per task.\nDiG-Flow\nconsistently improves both the\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\nand GR00T-N1 backbones.

Again, the gain is most pronounced on LIBERO-Long (\n90.6\n%\n→\n92.1\n%\n90.6\\%\\!\\to\\!92.1\\%\n), suggesting that\nDiG-Flow\nconsistently helps different architectures handle long-horizon reasoning. Importantly, the relative ordering of backbones is preserved:\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n-DiG remains stronger than GR00T-N1-DiG, indicating that\nDiG-Flow\nacts as a plug-and-play robustness layer rather than fundamentally changing the underlying policy capacity.\n6.1.3\nMain Results on RoboCasa (Few-Shot)\nRoboCasa poses a substantially harder generalization challenge than LIBERO: scenes are more diverse, the observation space is more visually complex, and most tasks involve contact-rich manipulation in cluttered kitchens. Moreover, our training regime is intentionally low-data, using only 50 demonstrations per task, which is roughly the number of human demonstrations provided per atomic task in the official benchmark.\nAs shown in Table\n2\n,\nDiG-Flow\nyields large gains in this setting. For\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n, integrating\nDiG-Flow\nimproves the average success rate from\n41.4\n%\n41.4\\%\nto\n52.6\n%\n52.6\\%\n(\n+\n11.2\n+11.2\npoints). Improvements are visible in all three categories, but are especially pronounced for door/drawer manipulation (\n+\n15.6\n+15.6\npoints), where precise contact and long-horizon geometry are critical. GR00T-N1 also benefits: GR00T-N1-DiG improves the average success rate from\n36.0\n%\n36.0\\%\nto\n43.2\n%\n43.2\\%\n(\n+\n7.2\n+7.2\npoints). The fact that both backbones gain substantially from the same\nDiG-Flow\nmodule, under severely limited data, reinforces our interpretation of discrepancy as a useful geometric regularizer that reduces overfitting to spurious correlations.\nTable 2\n:\nRoboCasa 24-task benchmark with 50 demonstrations per task.\nWe report success rates (%) averaged within categories and across all tasks.

These perturbations apply time-varying sinusoidal noise to both visual observations and proprioceptive states:\nc\n1\n​\ncos\n⁡\n(\nc\n2\n​\nt\n)\n,\nc\n3\n​\nsin\n⁡\n(\nc\n4\n​\nt\n)\nc_{1}\\cos(c_{2}t),c_{3}\\sin(c_{4}t)\n, with coefficients\nc\ni\n∼\n𝒩\n​\n(\n0.01\n,\n0.5\n)\nc_{i}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0.01,0.5)\n. Such perturbations are designed to disrupt brittle correlations that depend on static visual patterns or stereotyped trajectories, while leaving the underlying task semantics intact.\nTable 3\n:\nRobustness to non-stationary perturbations.\nSuccess rates (%) under different time-varying noise patterns that disrupt memorized shortcuts.\nDiG-Flow\nshows consistent improvements across perturbation types, with the most significant gains on complex long-horizon tasks.\nPerturbation\nMethod\nLIBERO-Spatial\nLIBERO-Object\nLIBERO-Goal\nLIBERO-Long\nAvg\nCosine only\nw/o\nDiG-Flow\n87.6\n89.8\n86.4\n70.2\n83.5\nw/\nDiG-Flow\n87.4\n-0.2%\n89.8\n0%\n91.6\n+6.0%\n80.0\n+14.0%\n87.2\n+4.4%\nSine only\nw/o\nDiG-Flow\n88.2\n88.4\n87.2\n68.6\n83.1\nw/\nDiG-Flow\n90.0\n+2.0%\n90.6\n+2.5%\n91.2\n+4.6%\n80.4\n+17.2%\n88.1\n+6.0%\nCosine + sine\nw/o\nDiG-Flow\n87.8\n87.2\n86.0\n67.8\n82.2\nw/\nDiG-Flow\n86.4\n-1.6%\n88.2\n+1.1%\n90.8\n+5.6%\n79.2\n+16.8%\n86.2\n+4.0%\nAs shown in Table\n3\n,\nDiG-Flow\nconsistently improves robustness across all perturbation types, with average gains between roughly 4–6 points. The improvements are most dramatic on LIBERO-Long, where long-horizon execution is particularly sensitive to small systematic biases. Spatial suites show smaller changes, and in a few cases performance is slightly reduced, reflecting that not all perturbations exclusively target shortcuts. Overall, these results support the view that discrepancy-guided gating makes policies less reliant on brittle, non-stationary correlations and more grounded in the geometric relationship between observations and actions.\n6.2\nReal Robot Experiments\n6.2.1\nReal Robot Setup\nFigure 4\n:\n(a)\nReal robot hardware setup (single-arm + dexterous hand.\n(b)\nExamples of real robot tasks. The two rows correspond to the two camera views.\nWe build a real robot setup similar to LIBERO and RoboCasa to validate our experiments in a more challenging real-world physical environment. We use a 7-DoF Franka Research 3 (FR3) arm equipped with a 6-DoF Inspire dexterous hand. Perception is provided by two Intel RealSense cameras mounted at complementary viewpoints, forming a stereo-like arrangement that reduces single-view occlusions. Both cameras stream synchronized RGB frames. The VLM backbone receives a fused representation of these views together with proprioceptive inputs (joint positions, velocities, and gripper states). Commands are sent to the low-level controller at 20 Hz. Following the chunked-action protocol, the policy outputs action chunks over a short horizon, which are then executed in open-loop without additional model-predictive control or trajectory optimization. The overall hardware layout is illustrated in Figure\n4\n(a).\nCompared to a simple two-finger gripper, the dexterous hand substantially increases the control dimensionality and contact complexity: the policy must not only reach the correct pose, but also coordinate multiple finger joints for stable power and precision grasps, tool operation (\ne.g\n., spraying, wiping), and in-hand adjustments. This task setting further exposes policy errors: inaccurate predictions cannot be easily corrected by low-level planners, making robustness and alignment particularly important.\nTo assess real‐world applicability of\nDiG-Flow\n, we design four distinct tasks covering different manipulation challenges. These tasks impose realistic 3D geometry, contact dynamics, and visual complexity, making them ideal for testing the hypothesis that discrepancy-guided modulation improves semantic grounding and robustness. We now detail the four real-robot tasks. These tasks are designed to mirror the difficulty patterns observed in LIBERO and RoboCasa while exposing additional challenges from real-world physics, sensor noise, and human interference. The tasks’ example settings are shown in Figure\n4\n(b).\n•\nStack-Bowls\n: stack bowls from scattered initial positions into a tower; tests precise multi-object grasping and placement, as well as collision avoidance between the hand and previously stacked bowls.\n•\nSpray-Plant\n: pick up a spray bottle and apply water mist to a potted plant along its foliage; tests tool-use behavior, fine motion control, and spatial anticipation to cover the plant surface.\n•\nWipe-Whiteboard\n: use a cloth to erase pen marks from a whiteboard; tests contact-rich surface interaction, maintaining stable pressure, and long-horizon sweeping motions.\n•\nSort-Into-Drawer\n: pick three varied objects and place them into a drawer one by one; tests sequential multi-step reasoning, diverse grasping strategies, and error accumulation over multiple object transfers.\nFor each task we only collect 50 human-teleoperated demonstrations for training, and evaluate for both whole-task success and sub-task success. Stack-Bowls has 5 subtasks, while the other tasks have 3 subtasks each. We report overall success rates and detailed analysis on perturbation and robustness tests.\nFigure 5\n:\nReal robot rollouts on four manipulation tasks.\nEach row shows a successful execution by\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n-DiG from left to right.\n(a)\nStack-Bowls\n: the robot sequentially grasps and stacks three bowls into a stable tower.\n(b)\nSpray-Plant\n: the robot picks up a spray bottle and waters the plant along its foliage.\n(c)\nWipe-Whiteboard\n: the robot wipes away pen marks on the board using a cloth.\n(d)\nSort-Into-Drawer\n: the robot picks and places three objects into a drawer, a long-horizon task that compounds errors across steps.\nThese qualitative rollouts illustrate that\nDiG-Flow\nenables stable multi-step behaviours across diverse contact-rich settings.\nTable 4\n:\nSuccess rates (%) of our models vs baseline on real robot tasks.\nWe show sub-task / whole-task success rates.\nTask\nStack-Bowls\nSpray-Plant\nWipe-Whiteboard\nSort-Into-Drawer\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n(baseline)\n58 / 40\n66 / 45\n62 / 38\n52 / 33\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n-DiG (Ours)\n62\n/\n48\n72\n/\n52\n70\n/\n48\n60\n/\n41\nTable\n4\nshows that\nDiG-Flow\nconsistently improves performance across all four tasks. On the long-horizon Sort-Into-Drawer task, whole-task success increases from 33% to 41% (+8 pts), illustrating that\nDiG-Flow\nhelps mitigate error accumulation in sequential decision chains. The more moderate gains on Spray-Plant and Wipe-Whiteboard reflect shorter horizons but still show benefit, particularly in sub-task success.\n6.2.2\nRobustness Analysis (Real Robot)\nWe next analyze how\nDiG-Flow\nbehaves under real-world perturbations that were not in the training demonstrations. The perturbed setups are illustrated in Figure\n6\n, and the corresponding success rates are reported in Table\n5\n.\nTable 5\n:\nSuccess rates (%) under unseen / perturbed conditions.\nWe show sub-task / whole-task success rates.\nMethod\nStack-Bowls (BG)\nSort-Into-Drawer (BG)\nSpray-Plant (Human)\nWipe-Whiteboard (Human)\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n42 / 15\n48 / 20\n35 / 10\n44 / 20\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n-DiG (Ours)\n65 / 40\n60 / 35\n62 / 30\n58 / 30\nFigure 6\n:\nUnseen and interfered real-world settings.\nWe evaluate robustness under\n(a)\nBackground Shifts\n, where table textures, cloths, and distractor objects are changed for Stack-Bowls and Sort-Into-Drawer, and\n(b)\nHuman Interference\n, where a human hand moves the plant or writes on the whiteboard during wiping.\nThese perturbations introduce visual and dynamic distribution shifts beyond the training data and correspond to the robustness results in Table\n5\n.\nBackground Shifts.\nFor Stack-Bowls and Sort-Into-Drawer, we change the table cloth color and pattern, add additional objects near the workspace, and vary global lighting conditions. Despite these shifts, our policy with\nDiG-Flow\nmaintains high success rates that are close to the unperturbed setting: most failures are due to rare extreme occlusions rather than systematic mistakes. Qualitatively, we observe that the robot continues to focus on the geometry of task-relevant objects (bowls, drawer, target items) even when the background appearance changes substantially, suggesting that the transport-based gating helps deprioritize accidental correlations with background textures.\nHuman Interference.\nFor Spray-Plant and Wipe-Whiteboard, we introduce a human hand that moves the plant or writes new strokes on the board while the robot is executing the policy. These interventions create both visual distractions and true dynamical changes (targets moving during execution). We find that the policy often adapts by slightly adjusting its trajectory to follow the plant motion or to cover newly written strokes, and overall success remains high relative to the no-interference baseline. Failures typically arise when the human intervention is adversarially timed (\ne.g\n., moving the plant exactly as the robot closes its grasp), which is challenging for any open-loop controller.\nTable\n5\nshows that all four perturbed variants are challenging: both policies see noticeable drops\ncompared to the clean setting, but\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n-DiG remains consistently more\nrobust. On\nStack-Bowls (BG)\nand\nSpray-Plant (Human)\n, the baseline\nwhole-task success falls to\n15\n%\n15\\%\nand\n10\n%\n10\\%\n, while\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n-DiG still\nachieves\n40\n%\n40\\%\nand\n30\n%\n30\\%\n, respectively. Even on the harder long-horizon\nSort-Into-Drawer (BG)\nscenario,\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n-DiG improves whole-task\nsuccess from\n20\n%\n20\\%\nto\n35\n%\n35\\%\n. A similar advantage appears for\nWipe-Whiteboard (Human)\n, where\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n-DiG reaches\n30\n%\n30\\%\nvs.\n20\n%\n20\\%\nfor the baseline. Overall, the relative gap between the two models is preserved\nor enlarged under background and human interference, indicating that\ndiscrepancy-guided modulation helps maintain stable observation-action\nalignment rather than overfitting to specific training scenes.\nOverall, these results support the view that geometry-aware gating improves robustness in the real world: the policy is less sensitive to superficial background statistics and more focused on the observation–action alignment relevant for the task.\n6.2.3\nHigh-DoF Humanoid with Active View Control\nFigure 7\n:\nHigh-DoF humanoid setup.\nOur 31-DoF humanoid platform with dual dexterous hands and an actively controlled head. The head mounts dual RGB cameras, while the torso and arms provide upper-body motion. The task is to clear 1-3 objects from the table into the box. This setting requires the policy to jointly coordinate head, body, and hands, rather than controlling only a low-DoF gripper from a fixed camera.\nTo further stress-test\nDiG-Flow\non more complex embodiments, we deploy\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\nand\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n-DiG on a 31-DoF upper-body humanoid platform equipped with dual dexterous hands and an actively controlled head camera. As illustrated in Figure\n7\n, the robot has independently actuated joints for the torso, neck, arms, and multi-finger hands, resulting in substantially higher dimensionality and contact complexity than traditional real-robot experiments. Unlike prior VLA settings that operate from a fixed third-person view and control only a low-DoF end-effector, our policy must simultaneously coordinate head,\nbody, and both hands, making both state estimation and control more challenging.\nThe head houses a pair of RGB cameras that provide an egocentric, movable viewpoint. During teleoperation, the operator naturally moves the head to obtain task-relevant views. The policy is trained to imitate this behavior and thus learns to actively adjust the viewpoint while manipulating objects. Figure\n8\nshows an example rollout: the robot first orients the head to obtain a clear view of the workspace, then uses dexterous hands to pick up objects and place them into a box while continuously refining its viewing angle. This active-view setup is particularly sensitive to representation misalignment.\nFigure 8\n:\nEgocentric active-view rollouts.\nExample sequence from the head-mounted camera during a clean-up episode. The humanoid first adjusts its viewpoint to obtain a clear observation of the workspace, then successively grasps objects with its dexterous hands and places them into the box.\nDiG-Flow\nhelps maintain robust observation–action alignment under camera motion and self-occlusions.\nWe collect 1000 teleoperated demonstrations of general tabletop clean-up tasks, where the robot is instructed to place 1-3 objects on the table into a box from diverse initial layouts.\nBoth\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\nand\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n-DiG are trained on this dataset with a batch size of 256 for 20K training steps, using the same flow-matching configuration as in our other real-robot experiments. We evaluate each model on 20 rollouts per condition, and report success rates in Table\n6\n. The “Seen” setting uses the same object categories and background\nas training, while the “Unseen” setting replaces both objects and background textures to induce distribution shift.\nTable 6\n:\nSuccess rates (%) on high-DoF humanoid clean-up tasks.\nEach entry reports the success rate over 20 evaluation rollouts for clearing 1-3 objects into the box. “Seen” uses the same object categories and background as the demonstrations, while “Unseen” uses novel objects and background textures.\nSeen\nUnseen & Perturbed\nMethod\n1 obj\n2 objs\n3 objs\n1 obj\n2 objs\n3 objs\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n75\n60\n35\n55\n30\n25\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n-DiG\n75\n65\n45\n65\n45\n40\nOn this challenging real-robot setting, the standard\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\nbaseline achieves only moderate performance, particularly when the scene contains multiple objects or unseen visual conditions. In contrast,\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n-DiG consistently improves success rates by 5-10 points across seen objects and backgrounds. As for unseen objects and background shift, the gains are even more pronounced. The advantages brought by\nDiG-Flow\nare also more obvious in complex multi-object tasks.\nThese results indicate that discrepancy-guided modulation remains effective even when the policy coordinates a high-DoF humanoid with active view control, providing both stronger performance and more robust behavior under visual and dynamical perturbations.\n6.3\nFurther Discussion on Method Design\nIn this section, we further explain the method design of\nDiG-Flow\nthrough ablation studies and mechanism analyses on the standard LIBERO benchmark.\n6.3.1\nDiscrepancy and Gating Ablations\nOur method has two key design choices: the discrepancy\nD\n​\n(\nμ\nH\n,\nμ\nZ\n)\nD(\\mu_{H},\\mu_{Z})\nthat measures observation–action mismatch, and the scalar gate\ng\n=\nϕ\n​\n(\nD\n)\ng=\\phi(D)\nthat maps this signal back to the backbone.\nWe therefore ablate these two components separately.\nTable 7\n:\nEffect of discrepancy choice on LIBERO (success %).\nAll rows use the same\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\nbackbone, scalar mapping\ng\n=\nexp\n⁡\n(\n−\nτ\n​\nD\n)\ng=\\exp(-\\tau D)\n, and residual operator; only the discrepancy\nD\n​\n(\nμ\nH\n,\nμ\nZ\n)\nD(\\mu_{H},\\mu_{Z})\nis varied.\nWasserstein-based discrepancies provide the strongest signal, especially on LIBERO-Long.\nDiscrepancy\nLIBERO-Spatial\nLIBERO-Object\nLIBERO-Goal\nLIBERO-Long\nAvg\nCosine distance\n98.2\n-1.0%\n97.8\n-1.2%\n97.2\n-1.4%\n92.6\n-3.8%\n96.5\n-1.8%\nMMD (RBF kernel)\n98.4\n-0.8%\n98.2\n-0.8%\n97.6\n-1.0%\n93.4\n-3.0%\n96.8\n-1.5%\nSinkhorn (\nε\n=\n0.1\n\\varepsilon=0.1\n)\n98.8\n-0.4%\n98.6\n-0.4%\n98.2\n-0.4%\n95.8\n-0.6%\n97.9\n-0.4%\nSliced Wasserstein (Ours)\n99.2\n99.0\n98.6\n96.4\n98.3\nTable\n7\nexamines how different discrepancy functions affect performance when applied to\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n-DiG on LIBERO.\nAll variants use the same scalar mapping\ng\n=\nexp\n⁡\n(\n−\nτ\n​\nD\n)\ng=\\exp(-\\tau D)\nand residual operator; only\nD\n​\n(\nμ\nH\n,\nμ\nZ\n)\nD(\\mu_{H},\\mu_{Z})\nis changed.\nNon-transport discrepancies such as cosine distance and MMD already provide moderate gains over the backbone (average\n96.5\n%\n96.5\\%\nand\n96.8\n%\n96.8\\%\n), confirming that even coarse measures of observation–action similarity can be beneficial.\nHowever, Wasserstein-based discrepancies consistently perform better.\nSinkhorn divergence (entropic OT) achieves\n97.9\n%\n97.9\\%\naverage success, while our default sliced 2-Wasserstein distance attains\n98.3\n%\n98.3\\%\nand the best results on LIBERO-Long.\nThis matches our theoretical intuition: Wasserstein distances respect the underlying geometry of the feature space, yielding a more faithful measure of distributional misalignment and a better-behaved supervision signal for the gate.\nTable 8\n:\nComparison of gating mechanisms.\nSuccess rates (%) for different gating strategies with the discrepancy fixed to sliced 2-Wasserstein.\nIn contrast to fixed or random modulation, our transport gate converts the geometric discrepancy into a meaningful confidence signal, yielding the best performance, especially on LIBERO-Long.\nGating Strategy\nLIBERO-Spatial\nLIBERO-Object\nLIBERO-Goal\nLIBERO-Long\nAvg\nFixed Gate (\ng\n=\n0.5\ng=0.5\n)\n96.8\n-2.4%\n95.4\n-3.6%\n92.2\n-6.5%\n84.6\n-12.2%\n92.3\n-6.1%\nRandom Gate (\ng\n∼\n𝒰\n​\n(\n0\n,\n1\n)\ng\\sim\\mathcal{U}(0,1)\n)\n95.2\n-4.0%\n93.8\n-5.3%\n89.4\n-9.3%\n80.8\n-16.2%\n89.8\n-8.7%\nTransport Gate (Ours)\n99.2\n99.0\n98.6\n96.4\n98.3\nTable\n8\ncomplements this study by fixing the sliced 2-Wasserstein discrepancy and varying only the gating mechanism.\nReplacing our transport gate with a fixed scalar (\ng\n=\n0.5\ng=0.5\n) reduces performance to\n92.3\n%\n92.3\\%\naverage success (-6.1%), indicating that uniform feature modulation cannot distinguish between semantically useful and spurious patterns.\nRandom gating performs even worse at\n89.8\n%\n89.8\\%\n(-8.7%), showing that arbitrary feature suppression actively harms learning by disrupting both beneficial and harmful correlations.\nThe degradation is particularly severe on LIBERO-Long (up to -16.2%), where long-horizon reasoning amplifies the effect of shortcut solutions.\nIn contrast, the discrepancy-guided transport gate preserves performance on simpler suites and yields the largest gains on LIBERO-Long, consistent with our interpretation that geometric alignment is most critical in sequential tasks.\nTaken together, Tables\n7\nand\n8\nshow that both the choice of discrepancy and the shape of the gate\nϕ\n​\n(\nD\n)\n\\phi(D)\nmatter for robust optimization.\n6.3.2\nRefinement Ablation\nIn Section\n5.1\n, we state that performance saturates within 3 refinement steps. Here we provide a more detailed analysis of this behavior on the standard LIBERO benchmark.\nFigure 9\n:\nEffect of refinement steps\nN\nrefine\nN_{\\text{refine}}\non LIBERO.\nWe vary the number of refinement iterations at inference time while keeping the training setup fixed.\nEven without refinement (\nN\nrefine\n=\n0\nN_{\\text{refine}}{=}0\n), the discrepancy-guided flow model already surpasses the backbone policy. Adding a small number of refinement steps further improves performance and quickly saturates around\nN\nrefine\n=\n3\nN_{\\text{refine}}{=}3\n.\nFigure\n9\nreports the average LIBERO success rate when we vary the number of refinement iterations\nN\nrefine\nN_{\\text{refine}}\nat test time.\nWe observe three consistent trends:\n•\nPerformance gains even with\nN\nrefine\n=\n0\nN_{\\text{refine}}{=}0\n.\nThe curve shows that the\nN\nrefine\n=\n0\nN_{\\text{refine}}{=}0\nvariant already achieves a strong success rate on LIBERO.\nThis indicates that the discrepancy-guided residual update improves the learned policy itself, rather than only acting as a test-time heuristic.\n•\nFew refinement steps bring stable improvements.\nIncreasing\nN\nrefine\nN_{\\text{refine}}\nfrom 0 to 3 yields consistent performance gains and quickly brings the curve close to saturation.\nThis supports our choice of using\nN\nrefine\n=\n3\nN_{\\text{refine}}{=}3\nby default: it captures most of the benefit of refinement while keeping the additional computation per control step modest.\n•\nBeyond 3 steps, performance saturates with small fluctuations.\nFor\nN\nrefine\n>\n3\nN_{\\text{refine}}>3\n, the success rate fluctuates slightly around the same plateau level, without systematic degradation.\nWe attribute the small variations to evaluation noise and the fact that once the flow model has already produced a near-optimal action chunk, further refinement only provides marginal adjustments.\nOverall, these results confirm that (i)\nDiG-Flow\nis already useful without refinement, and (ii) a small number of refinement steps provides a good trade-off between robustness/performance and inference cost.\n6.3.3\nHyperparameter Analysis\nFigure 10\n:\nHyperparameter sensitivity of\nDiG-Flow\n.\n(a)\nSuccess rate as a function of the number of sliced projections\nK\nK\nused for approximating the Wasserstein discrepancy.\nPerformance improves steadily from very small\nK\nK\nand saturates once\nK\n≈\n28\nK\\approx 28\n–\n32\n32\n, indicating that a moderate number of projections is sufficient for a stable transport estimate.\n(b)\nJoint effect of the residual strength\nλ\n\\lambda\n(in Eq.\n11\n) and the temperature\nτ\n\\tau\nin\ng\n=\nmax\n⁡\n{\ng\nmin\n,\nexp\n⁡\n(\n−\nτ\n​\nD\n)\n}\ng=\\max\\{g_{\\min},\\exp(-\\tau D)\\}\n.\nWe observe a broad plateau around\n(\nλ\n,\nτ\n)\n≈\n(\n0.4\n,\n1.0\n)\n(\\lambda,\\tau)\\approx(0.4,1.0)\nand an elongated ridge roughly following\nλ\n​\nτ\n≈\n0.4\n\\lambda\\tau\\approx 0.4\n, showing that the two hyperparameters jointly control an effective gating strength while still providing some flexibility: increasing\nλ\n\\lambda\ncan be partially compensated by decreasing\nτ\n\\tau\n, and vice versa, but moving too far from the ridge degrades performance.\nFigure\n10\nsummarizes the sensitivity of\nDiG-Flow\nto its main hyperparameters. Panel\n10\n(a) varies the number of sliced projections\nK\nK\nused to approximate the Wasserstein discrepancy. We observe a smooth, monotone improvement as\nK\nK\nincreases from\n4\n4\nto\n20\n20\n, after which performance quickly saturates around\nK\n≈\n28\nK\\approx 28\n–\n32\n32\n. This matches the theoretical trade-off: more projections reduce Monte Carlo variance in the sliced Wasserstein estimate, but beyond a moderate budget the marginal benefit becomes negligible relative to the dominant transformer cost. In all reported experiments we therefore fix\nK\n=\n32\nK=32\n, which lies in the flat regime and offers a good balance between accuracy and overhead.\nPanel\n10\n(b) studies the joint effect of the residual strength\nλ\n\\lambda\n(in Eq.(\n11\n)) and the temperature\nτ\n\\tau\nin the gate\ng\n=\nexp\n⁡\n(\n−\nτ\n​\nD\n)\ng=\\exp(-\\tau D)\n. The heatmap reveals two important properties. First, there is a broad plateau around\n(\nλ\n,\nτ\n)\n≈\n(\n0.4\n,\n1.0\n)\n(\\lambda,\\tau)\\approx(0.4,1.0)\n, indicating that\nDiG-Flow\nis not overly sensitive to small mis-tuning and that our default choice lies in a robust operating region rather than at a sharp optimum. Second, the high-performance region forms an elongated ridge approximately following\nλ\n​\nτ\n≈\nconst\n\\lambda\\tau\\approx\\text{const}\n, which is consistent with the interpretation that\nλ\n\\lambda\nand\nτ\n\\tau\njointly control an effective gating strength\nλ\n​\ng\n​\n(\nτ\n)\n\\lambda g(\\tau)\n: increasing\nλ\n\\lambda\ncan be partially compensated by reducing\nτ\n\\tau\n(which softens the gate), and vice versa. The slight diagonal elongation reflects the fact that the effective step size in feature space scales like\n‖\nH\n~\n−\nH\n‖\nF\n≈\nλ\n​\ng\n​\n‖\nℛ\n​\n(\nH\n)\n‖\nF\n≈\nλ\n​\nmax\n⁡\n{\ng\nmin\n,\nexp\n⁡\n(\n−\nτ\n​\nD\n)\n}\n​\n‖\nℛ\n​\n(\nH\n)\n‖\nF\n,\n\\|\\tilde{H}-H\\|_{F}\\;\\approx\\;\\lambda\\,g\\,\\|\\mathcal{R}(H)\\|_{F}\\;\\approx\\;\\lambda\\,\\max\\{g_{\\min},\\exp(-\\tau D)\\}\\,\\|\\mathcal{R}(H)\\|_{F},\n(32)\nAt the same time, the ridge is not perfectly flat, so\nλ\n\\lambda\nand\nτ\n\\tau\nare not fully redundant. In particular, large\nλ\n\\lambda\nwith aggressive\nτ\n\\tau\ncan lead to over-amplified residuals that violate the small-step assumption in Theorem\n5.1\n, while very small\nλ\n\\lambda\nwith extremely soft gates under-utilizes the residual pathway and reduces the advantage over the baseline. The heatmap therefore supports the theoretical picture: there exists a nontrivial band of\n(\nλ\n,\nτ\n)\n(\\lambda,\\tau)\nvalues where the transport-guided residual update yields consistent gains, and our defaults\n(\nλ\n=\n0.4\n,\nτ\n=\n1.0\n)\n(\\lambda=0.4,\\tau=1.0)\nsit well inside this stable band rather than being a knife-edge configuration.\n6.3.4\nTransport-Cost Dynamics and Gating Behaviour\nFigure 11\n:\nDynamics of the transport discrepancy\nD\n​\n(\nμ\nH\n,\nμ\nZ\n)\nD(\\mu_{H},\\mu_{Z})\nduring training.\nWe plot the average sliced\nW\n2\n2\nW_{2}^{2}\nbetween observation and action embeddings over training\niterations (shaded region indicates variability across batches). The cost decreases steadily in the\nearly phase and then stabilizes in a medium range, instead of collapsing to zero, matching the\nintended role of\nD\nD\nas a discriminative geometric signal rather than a pure minimization target.\nIn addition to task-level success rates, we also monitor the behaviour of the transport discrepancy\nD\n​\n(\nμ\nH\n,\nμ\nZ\n)\nD(\\mu_{H},\\mu_{Z})\nduring training. Figure\n11\nreports the evolution of the\naverage sliced\n2\n2\n-Wasserstein cost between the empirical observation and action embedding\ndistributions over training iterations for\nDiG-Flow\non LIBERO.\nThree observations are worth highlighting.\n(i) Training phases.\nAt the beginning of training the transport cost is relatively high, reflecting the fact that\nobservation features\nH\nH\nand action embeddings\nZ\nZ\nlive in poorly aligned regions of the feature\nspace. As optimisation proceeds,\nD\n​\n(\nμ\nH\n,\nμ\nZ\n)\nD(\\mu_{H},\\mu_{Z})\ndecreases monotonically and then enters a\nsteady-state regime where it fluctuates around a stable value. This behaviour is consistent with\nthe interpretation of\nD\nD\nas measuring semantic compatibility between observation and action\nrepresentations: the model gradually learns to place both in a geometrically coherent region.\n(ii)\nD\nD\nas a signal, not a loss term.\nImportantly, the curve in Figure\n11\ndoes not keep decreasing towards zero.\nInstead, it converges to a medium range where\nD\nD\nis neither vanishing nor exploding. This is\nexactly the regime in which the gate\ng\n=\nmax\n⁡\n{\ng\nmin\n,\nexp\n⁡\n(\n−\nτ\n​\nD\n​\n(\nμ\nH\n,\nμ\nZ\n)\n)\n}\ng\\;=\\;\\max\\bigl\\{g_{\\min},\\exp\\bigl(-\\tau\\,D(\\mu_{H},\\mu_{Z})\\bigr)\\bigr\\}\nretains discriminative power: samples with relatively low discrepancy still receive stronger gates,\nwhile samples with larger discrepancy are down-weighted, but no regime dominates completely.\nDriving\nD\nD\nto (near-)zero would make\ng\n≈\n1\ng\\approx 1\nfor almost all samples and therefore remove\nthe benefit of discrepancy-guided modulation; conversely, extremely large\nD\nD\nwould force\ng\n≈\n0\ng\\approx 0\nand effectively deactivate the residual path.\n(iii) Connection to gated residual theory and hyperparameters.\nThe observed range of\nD\nD\nprovides empirical support for the theoretical assumptions used in\nSection\n5\n. Theorem\n5.1\nrequires that the gated residual update\nH\n~\n=\nH\n+\nλ\n​\ng\n​\nℛ\n​\n(\nH\n)\n\\tilde{H}\\;=\\;H+\\lambda\\,g\\,\\mathcal{R}(H)\nremains in a regime where the first-order improvement term dominates the quadratic penalty\ncontrolled by\nL\nH\nL_{H}\nand\nB\nℛ\nB_{\\mathcal{R}}\n(Assumption\n8.1\n). The fact that\nD\nD\nstabilizes in a moderate range implies that the effective step size (Eq. (\n32\n)) naturally stays within such a “small but non-negligible” band throughout training, matching the\nregime in which Theorem\n5.1\nguarantees expected loss reduction. This also explains the shape of the hyperparameter landscape in\nFigure\n10\n. Since\nD\n​\n(\nμ\nH\n,\nμ\nZ\n)\nD(\\mu_{H},\\mu_{Z})\nconcentrates in a relatively narrow\ninterval once training has converged, there exists a family of\n(\nλ\n,\nτ\n)\n(\\lambda,\\tau)\npairs that produce\nsimilar effective magnitudes of\nλ\n​\ng\n\\lambda g\non typical samples. The broad plateau in\nFigure\n10\n(b) and the smooth one-dimensional curves over\nλ\n\\lambda\nand\nτ\n\\tau\nare consistent with this picture:\nDiG-Flow\nis robust to moderate changes in either\nparameter, as long as the resulting transport cost keeps the gate in the informative middle range\nillustrated in Figure\n11\n.\n7\nConclusions and Limitations\nWe presented\nDiG-Flow\n, a discrepancy-guided flow matching framework that regularizes VLA representations through a simple geometric signal between observation and action embeddings. By mapping this distributional discrepancy to a scalar gate and applying residual updates in feature space,\nDiG-Flow\nleaves the flow-matching path and objective intact while shaping the representations used by the action head. Our analysis shows that the gated objective admits standard descent guarantees, that suitably small residual updates provably reduce the loss under an alignment condition, and that a fixed-gate refinement scheme forms a contraction.\nWhile\nDiG-Flow\ndemonstrates strong performance in both simulation and real-world experiments, several limitations warrant discussion.\nFirst, our theoretical analysis assumes that features have bounded norms (\ne.g\n.,\n‖\nH\n‖\nF\n≤\nR\n\\|H\\|_{F}\\leq R\n). This is reasonable for normalized representations but may require additional scaling or normalization mechanisms when applied to architectures that do not enforce such bounds.\nSecond, the transport distance computation currently relies on batch-level statistics, which can be influenced by outliers or small batch sizes. In principle, this could make the gate slightly sensitive to the composition of a mini-batch. Exploring alternatives such as running statistics, more robust discrepancy measures, or fully instance-wise variants would be an interesting direction for future work.\nFinally,\nDiG-Flow\nuses ground-truth actions during supervised training to compute meaningful observation–action discrepancies. Extending the same principle to self-supervised or reinforcement learning regimes would require alternative alignment signals (\ne.g\n., consistency across rollouts, value-based or advantage-based weighting), which we leave for future research.\nReferences\n[1]\nAnthony Brohan, Noah Brown, Justice Carbajal, Yevgen Chebotar, Joseph Dabis, Chelsea Finn, Keerthana Gopalakrishnan, Karol Hausman, Alex Herzog, Jasmine Hsu, Julian Ibarz, Brian Ichter, Alex Irpan, Tomas Jackson, Sally Jesmonth, Nikhil J Joshi, Ryan Julian, Dmitry Kalashnikov, Yuheng Kuang, Isabel Leal, Kuang-Huei Lee, Sergey Levine, Yao Lu, Utsav Malla, Deeksha Manjunath, Igor Mordatch, Ofir Nachum, Carolina Parada, Jodilyn Peralta, Emily Perez, Karl Pertsch, Jornell Quiambao, Kanishka Rao, Michael Ryoo, Grecia Salazar, Pannag Sanketi, Kevin Sayed, Jaspiar Singh, Sumedh Sontakke, Austin Stone, Clayton Tan, Huong Tran, Vincent Vanhoucke, Steve Vega, Quan Vuong, Fei Xia, Ted Xiao, Peng Xu, Sichun Xu, Tianhe Yu, and Brianna Zitkovich.\nRt-1: Robotics transformer for real-world control at scale, 2023.\n[2]\nMoo Jin Kim, Karl Pertsch, Siddharth Karamcheti, Ted Xiao, Ashwin Baljekar, Suraj Nair, Rafael Rafailov, Ethan Foster, Grace Lam, Pannag Sanketi, et al.\nOpenvla: An open-source vision-language-action model.\narXiv preprint arXiv:2406.09246\n, 2024.\n[3]\nKevin Black, Noah Brown, Danny Driess, Adnan Esmail, Michael Equi, Chelsea Finn, Niccolo Fusai, Lachy Groom, Karol Hausman, Brian Ichter, et al.\nπ\n0\n\\pi_{0}\n: A vision-language-action flow model for general robot control.\narXiv preprint arXiv:2410.24164\n, 2024.\n[4]\nPhysical Intelligence, Kevin Black, Noah Brown, James Darpinian, Karan Dhabalia, Danny Driess, Adnan Esmail, Michael Equi, Chelsea Finn, Niccolo Fusai, et al.\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n: a vision-language-action model with open-world generalization.\narXiv preprint arXiv:2504.16054\n, 2025.\n[5]\nYaron Lipman, Ricky TQ Chen, Heli Ben-Hamu, Maximilian Nickel, and Matt Le.\nFlow matching for generative modeling.\narXiv preprint arXiv:2210.02747\n, 2023.\n[6]\nDeyao Zhu, Jun Chen, Xiaoqian Shen, Xiang Li, and Mohamed Elhoseiny.\nMinigpt-4: Enhancing vision-language understanding with advanced large language models.\narXiv preprint arXiv:2304.10592\n, 2023.\n[7]\nPeng Wang, Shuai Bai, Sinan Tan, Shijie Wang, Zhihao Fan, Jinze Bai, Keqin Chen, Xuejing Liu, Jialin Wang, Wenbin Ge, et al.\nQwen2-vl: Enhancing vision-language model’s perception of the world at any resolution.\narXiv preprint arXiv:2409.12191\n, 2024.\n[8]\nHugo Touvron, Thibaut Lavril, Gautier Izacard, Xavier Martinet, Marie-Anne Lachaux, Timothée Lacroix, Baptiste Rozière, Naman Goyal, Eric Hambro, Faisal Azhar, et al.\nLlama: Open and efficient foundation language models.\narXiv preprint arXiv:2302.13971\n, 2023.\n[9]\nHugo Touvron, Louis Martin, Kevin Stone, Peter Albert, Amjad Almahairi, Yasmine Babaei, Nikolay Bashlykov, Soumya Batra, Prajjwal Bhargava, Shruti Bhosale, et al.\nLlama 2: Open foundation and fine-tuned chat models.\narXiv preprint arXiv:2307.09288\n, 2023.\n[10]\nJinze Bai, Shuai Bai, Yunfei Chu, Zeyu Cui, Kai Dang, Xiaodong Deng, Yang Fan, Wenbin Ge, Yu Han, Fei Huang, et al.\nQwen technical report.\narXiv preprint arXiv:2309.16609\n, 2023.\n[11]\nAlec Radford, Jong Wook Kim, Chris Hallacy, Aditya Ramesh, Gabriel Goh, Sandhini Agarwal, Girish Sastry, Amanda Askell, Pamela Mishkin, Jack Clark, et al.\nLearning transferable visual models from natural language supervision.\nIn\nInternational conference on machine learning\n, pages 8748–8763.

  "preview_text": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models trained with flow matching have demonstrated impressive capabilities on robotic manipulation tasks. However, their performance often degrades under distribution shift and on complex multi-step tasks, suggesting that the learned representations may not robustly capture task-relevant semantics. We introduce DiG-Flow, a principled framework that enhances VLA robustness through geometric regularization. Our key insight is that the distributional discrepancy between observation and action embeddings provides a meaningful geometric signal: lower transport cost indicates compatible representations, while higher cost suggests potential misalignment. DiG-Flow computes a discrepancy measure between empirical distributions of observation and action embeddings, maps it to a modulation weight via a monotone function, and applies residual updates to the observation embeddings before flow matching. Crucially, this intervention operates at the representation level without modifying the flow matching path or target vector field. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that discrepancy-guided training provably decreases the training objective, and that guided inference refinement converges with contraction. Empirically, DiG-Flow integrates into existing VLA architectures with negligible overhead and consistently improves performance, with particularly pronounced gains on complex multi-step tasks and under limited training data.\n\n\\cthnewtheorem\ntheoremTheorem\n\\cthnewtheorem\nassumptionAssumption\n\\cthnewtheorem\nlemmaLemma\n\\webpage\nhttps://beingbeyond.github.io/DiG-Flow\nDiG-Flow\n: Discrepancy-Guided Flow Matching for Robust VLA Models\nWanpeng Zhang\n1,2\nYe Wang\n2,3\nHao Luo\n1,2\nHaoqi Yuan\n1,2\nYicheng Feng\n1,2\nSipeng Zheng\n2\nQin Jin\n3\nZongqing Lu\n1,2,†\n1\nPeking University\n2\nBeingBeyond\n3\nRenmin University of China\nAbstract\nVision-Language-Action (VLA) models trained with flow matching have demonstrated impressive capabilities on robotic manipulation tas",

      "answer": "## DiG-Flow: Discrepancy-Guided Flow Matching for Robust VLA Models\n\n这篇论文的核心创新在于提出了一种名为 **DiG-Flow** 的新框架，旨在解决当前基于流匹配（Flow Matching）的视觉-语言-动作（Vision-Language-Action, VLA）模型在面对分布偏移和复杂多步任务时鲁棒性不足的关键问题。\n\n### 核心要解决的问题\n\n1.  **鲁棒性差 (Poor Robustness)**：现有的VLA模型虽然在标准测试集上表现优异，但在遇到光照、纹理或视角等微小变化时，性能会显著下降。\n2.  **错误累积 (Error Accumulation)**：在长序列、多步骤的任务中，早期决策的微小错误会被放大，导致最终任务失败。\n3.  **表征脆弱性 (Fragile Representations)**：根本原因在于，模型学习到的“观察”与“动作”之间的表征可能并未真正捕捉到任务相关的语义，而是依赖于一些脆弱的、虚假的相关性（spurious correlations）。\n\n### 核心创新点与解决方案\n\nDiG-Flow 的核心思想是引入一个**几何正则化信号**来指导训练过程，其关键创新点如下：\n\n-   **洞察力 (Key Insight)**：**观察特征**（Observation Embeddings）和**动作特征**（Action Embeddings）之间的**分布差异**（Discrepancy）是一个有意义的几何信号。低差异意味着两者兼容，表征对齐良好；高差异则表明潜在的错位，可能源于分布外（OOD）输入或学习到了虚假模式。\n\n-   **方法 (How it Solves the Problem)**：\n    1.  **计算差异 (Compute Discrepancy)**：使用**切片Wasserstein距离**（Sliced Wasserstein Distance）作为默认的差异度量函数 `D(μ_H, μ_Z)`，量化观察特征分布 `μ_H` 和动作特征分布 `μ_Z` 之间的几何距离。\n    2.  **生成调制门控 (Generate Modulation Gate)**：通过一个单调递减的函数 `g = ϕ(D)` 将差异值映射为一个[0,1]范围内的门控权重 `g`。例如，`g = max{g_min, exp(-τD)}`。差异越小，`g` 越接近1，表示该样本更可靠；差异越大，`g` 越小，表示该样本可能不可靠。\n    3.  **残差更新 (Residual Update)**：利用这个门控 `g` 对原始的观察特征 `H` 进行加权的残差更新，生成增强后的特征 `H̃`：\n        ```math\n        \\tilde{H} = H + \\lambda \\cdot g \\cdot \\mathcal{R}(H)\n        ```\n        其中 `ℛ(H)` 是一个轻量级的线性变换模块（DiG-Block），`λ` 是强度系数。当 `g` 大时，残差调整被充分应用；当 `g` 小时，调整被抑制。\n    4.  **无缝集成 (Seamless Integration)**：最关键的是，这一系列操作发生在**表征层面**，它只修改了送入流匹配头（flow-matching head）的特征 `H̃`，而**完全不改变**原有的流匹配路径、目标向量场或基础训练目标。这使得DiG-Flow可以像一个即插即用的“鲁棒性增强层”一样，轻松集成到任何现有的VLA架构中。\n\n### 总结\n\n简而言之，DiG-Flow 通过**测量并利用观察与动作表征之间的几何差异**，动态地为每个训练样本分配一个置信度（门控 `g`），并据此有选择性地调整观察特征。这种方法**引导模型更加关注那些表征对齐良好的、语义一致的样本**，从而学到更稳健、更少依赖虚假相关性的策略，有效提升了模型在复杂、多变环境下的泛化能力和鲁棒性。",

                                            |\n| **训练目标**         | 标准的 Flow Matching 回归损失 ℒ(θ)            | **加权的 Flow Matching 损失 J(θ) = 𝔼[g · ℓ(θ)]**           | DiG-Flow 不改变原始损失形式，而是用一个由几何差异计算出的门控权重 `g` 对每个样本的损失进行加权。                                        |\n| **表示学习**         | 无显式约束                                  | **显式几何正则化**                                         | DiG-Flow 的核心创新。它计算观察特征 `H` 和动作嵌入 `Z` 之间的 Wasserstein 距离 `D`，并利用此信号调整 `H`。                              |\n| **干预层面**         | 动作空间 (x_t)                               | **表示空间 (H)**                                           | 这是根本区别。`π₀.5` 只关心如何从噪声 `x_0` 流向动作 `x_1`。DiG-Flow 则在更早的阶段——即输入给 flow head 的**条件特征 `H`** 上进行干预。 |\n| **对骨干网络的影响** | 无                                          | **动态调制**                                               | DiG-Block 会对骨干网络输出的 `H` 进行残差更新 `H̃ = H + λ·g·ℛ(H)`，使得最终用于生成动作的条件特征 `H̃` 更好地与动作语义对齐。          |\n\n> **总结**: DiG-Flow 可以看作是 `π₀.5` 的一个“智能滤波器”。它让 `π₀.5` 的流程匹配头接收到了一个经过“净化”和“对齐”的条件信号 `H̃`，而不是原始的、可能包含误导性信息的 `H`。\n\n#### 2. 与 OT-CFM [39, 40] 的关系：从“路径”到“表示”的转变\n\nOT-CFM 也是一个结合了 Optimal Transport (OT) 和 Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) 的工作，但它与 DiG-Flow 的思路截然不同。\n\n| 特性             | OT-CFM                                       | **DiG-Flow**                                     | 改进说明                                                                                                                                 |\n|------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **OT 的应用对象** | **概率路径 (Probability Path)**             | **经验分布 (Empirical Distributions μ_H, μ_Z)** | OT-CFM 使用 OT 来寻找两个分布之间最优的传输路径，从而定义一个更好的 flow path `p_t`。DiG-Flow 使用 OT (Wasserstein) 作为衡量两个静态分布间距离的度量。 |\n| **干预层级**     | **流动力学 (Flow Dynamics)**                  | **表示学习 (Representation Learning)**          | OT-CFM 修改的是 ODE 的求解过程或目标向量场 `v*`。DiG-Flow 完全不碰 flow matching 的任何部分，只在上游修改条件输入。                           |\n| **目的**         | 找到更平滑、更高效的生成轨迹。               | 学习更稳健、语义对齐的表示。                     | OT-CFM 优化的是“怎么走”，DiG-Flow 优化的是“从哪里出发”（即条件的质量）。                                                                   |\n| **兼容性**       | 需要修改 flow matching 的训练和推理流程。    | **即插即用**，可无缝集成到现有 VLA 模型。        | DiG-Flow 的设计使其可以轻松地添加到 `π₀.5` 或 `GR00T-N1` 等模型中，而无需重新设计整个生成器。                                                |\n\n> **总结**: DiG-Flow 的创新在于**分离了表示学习和动作生成**。它认识到，即使有一个完美的生成器（如 flow matching），如果输入的条件是错的，结果也会是错的。因此，它选择在表示层面施加一个廉价但有效的几何约束。\n\n#### 3. 与 CoT-VLA [30] 的关系：从“推理”到“学习”的区别\n\nCoT-VLA 引入了视觉链式思维（Chain-of-Thought），通过让模型生成中间推理步骤来提升决策质量。\n\n| 特性         | CoT-VLA                                    | **DiG-Flow**                                   | 改进说明                                                                                                 |\n|--------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **作用时机** | **推理时 (Inference-time)**                 | **训练时 (Training-time) & 推理时**            | CoT-VLA 在执行时增加计算开销来生成解释。DiG-Flow 主要在训练时通过加权损失塑造表示，在推理时只需一次前向传播即可获得增益。 |\n| **作用方式** | 增加序列长度，引导模型逐步思考。           | **隐式地重塑损失景观**                         | CoT-VLA 显式地增加了模型的输出维度。DiG-Flow 则是隐式的，它通过 `g` 抑制那些“走捷径”的样本的学习，鼓励模型学习更稳健的映射。 |\n| **目标**     | 提升复杂任务的规划和推理能力。             | 提升表示的鲁棒性和泛化性，减少对虚假相关性的依赖。 | 两者都针对复杂任务，但切入点不同。CoT-VLA 解决“怎么做”，DiG-Flow 解决“为什么能做”（即表示是否可靠）。                   |\n\n> **总结**: DiG-Flow 的优势在于其**高效性**。它不需要在推理时产生额外的 token，就能在训练过程中学到更稳健的表示，这对于实时控制至关重要。\n\n---\n\n### DiG-Flow

      "answer": "## 论文实验与性能分析\n\n该论文在多个仿真和真实世界的数据集上进行了广泛的实验，以验证其提出的 **DiG-Flow** 框架的有效性。实验设计旨在评估模型在标准任务、复杂多步任务以及分布偏移下的鲁棒性和泛化能力。\n\n### 实验数据集\n\n论文主要在以下两个核心基准上进行了评估：\n\n1.  **LIBERO**: 一个标准化的桌面机器人操作基准，包含基于语言指令的任务。它被细分为四个子套件：\n    *   **LIBERO-Spatial**: 空间推理和物体放置。\n    *   **LIBERO-Object**: 处理具有不同属性和外观的多样化物体。\n    *   **LIBERO-Goal**: 目标条件指令。\n    *   **LIBERO-Long**: 长时间跨度、多步骤的任务（这是评估 DiG-Flow 效果最关键的场景）。\n\n2.  **RoboCasa**: 一个基于 NVIDIA Isaac Sim 构建的可扩展家庭机器人模拟平台，提供逼真的厨房场景和多样化的操作任务（如拾取放置、开关柜门、按按钮等）。为了测试在低数据量下的泛化能力，所有模型仅使用每个任务的 **50个演示** 进行训练。\n\n此外，论文还在**真实机器人硬件**上进行了实验，包括：\n*   一个配备灵巧手的单臂机器人（Franka Research 3）。\n*   一个拥有31个自由度的双手机器人平台，用于测试高维控制和主动视角调整。\n\n### 主要评估指标\n\n主要的评估指标是 **成功率 (Success Rate)**，具体定义如下：\n*   在仿真环境中，对每个任务进行 **50次 rollout**，计算成功完成任务的比例。\n*   在真实机器人实验中，同样报告了整体任务成功率和子任务成功率。\n\n### 性能提升\n\nDiG-Flow 在所有基准上都带来了显著且一致的性能提升，尤其是在复杂的多步任务和数据受限的场景下：\n\n#### 1. 在 LIBERO 基准上的提升\n-   当应用于强大的 `π0.5` 基线时，`π0.5-DiG` 将平均成功率从 **96.9%** 提升至 **98.3%**。\n-   最大的增益出现在 **LIBERO-Long** 子集上，成功率从 **92.4%** 显著提升至 **96.4%**（+4.0个百分点），这直接证明了 DiG-Flow 在减少长序列任务中的错误累积方面非常有效。\n\n#### 2. 在 RoboCasa (少样本) 基准上的提升\n-   在极具挑战性的低数据量设置下（每任务仅50个演示），性能提升更为惊人。\n-   对于 `π0.5` 模型，集成 DiG-Flow 后，平均成功率从 **41.4%** 跃升至 **52.6%**（+11.2个百分点）。\n-   对于 `GR00T-N1` 模型，平均成功率也从 **36.0%** 提升至 **43.2%**（+7.2个百分点）。\n-   这表明 DiG-Flow 作为一种几何正则化器，能有效防止模型过拟合到虚假相关性，在数据稀缺时尤为关键。\n\n#### 3. 在真实机器人上的提升\n-   在真实的物理环境中，`π0.5-DiG` 在所有四项任务上均优于基线 `π0.5`。\n-   例如，在长序列的 \"Sort-Into-Drawer\" 任务中，整体任务成功率从 **33%** 提升至 **41%**（+8个百分点），再次凸显了其在缓解误差累积方面的优势。\n\n#### 4. 鲁棒性提升\n-   在引入非平稳扰动（如随时间变化的噪声）的鲁棒性测试中，DiG-Flow 展现出更强的稳定性。\n-   例如，在 LIBERO-Long 上，当加入余弦和正弦噪声时，基线模型的成功率下降至 67.8%，而 DiG-Flow 仍能保持在 **79.2%**，显示出其对破坏性捷径学习的抵抗力。\n\n**总结来说，DiG-Flow 的核心价值在于：**\n-   **技术层面**：通过一种轻量级、即插即用的表示层干预，利用 Wasserstein 距离作为几何信号来指导训练和推理。\n-   **实际价值**：在不改变原有流程匹配架构的前提下，实现了**显著的性能提升**，特别是在**复杂多步任务**和**数据有限**的场景下，并大幅增强了模型的**鲁棒性**，使其在面对真实世界的分布偏移时表现更稳定。",

      "question": "论文的主要局限性有哪些？未来可能的改进方向是什么？",
      "answer": "## 论文的主要局限性与未来改进方向\n\n根据论文第7节“Conclusions and Limitations”的总结，**DiG-Flow** 框架虽然在性能和鲁棒性上取得了显著提升，但仍存在以下三个主要局限性，并对应着明确的未来研究方向：\n\n### 主要局限性 (Limitations)\n\n1.  **对特征范数有隐含假设**：\n    *   **问题描述**：理论分析（如Theorem 5.1）依赖于一个关键假设，即观察特征 `H` 的Frobenius范数是有界的（例如 `‖H‖_F ≤ R`）。这个假设对于经过归一化的表示是合理的。\n    *   **潜在风险**：当该框架应用于不强制执行此类边界约束的其他架构时，可能会出现问题。如果特征范数过大或过小，可能会影响残差更新的有效性，甚至破坏理论保证。\n\n2.  **批处理级别的统计依赖**：\n    *   **问题描述**：计算分布差异 `D(μ_H, μ_Z)` 依赖于当前mini-batch中的样本统计信息。\n    *   **潜在风险**：这使得门控信号 `g` 可能受到批次内异常值或小批量大小的影响。批次的组成会直接影响到哪些样本被赋予高权重或低权重，可能导致训练过程不够稳定或对批次采样敏感。\n\n3.  **依赖监督学习中的真实动作**：\n    *   **问题描述**：在训练阶段，`DiG-Flow` 需要使用数据集中的**真实动作**（ground-truth actions）来编码生成 `Z_gt`，从而计算出有意义的、用于指导学习的观察-动作对齐信号。\n    *   **核心限制**：这一设计使其难以直接扩展到**自监督学习**（self-supervised learning）或**强化学习**（reinforcement learning）等场景，在这些场景中无法轻易获得真实动作标签。\n\n### 未来可能的改进方向 (Future Directions)\n\n针对上述局限性，论文明确指出了几个富有潜力的未来研究方向：\n\n-   **解决特征范数问题**：\n    > “Exploring alternatives such as running statistics, more robust discrepancy measures, or fully instance-wise variants would be an interesting direction for future work.”\n    >\n    > 探索替代方案，例如使用**运行统计量**（running statistics）、更**鲁棒的差异度量**，或完全**实例级**（instance-wise）的变体，将是未来工作的一个有趣方向。\n\n-   **解决批处理依赖问题**：\n    > 同上，探索**运行统计量**（running statistics）可以有效缓解对单个mini-batch的依赖，通过维护一个长期的、平滑的分布估计来计算差异，从而提高稳定性。\n\n-   **扩展至非监督/强化学习场景**：\n    > “Extending the same principle to self-supervised or reinforcement learning regimes would require alternative alignment signals (e.g., consistency across rollouts, value-based or advantage-based weighting), which we leave for future research.”\n    >\n    > 将相同的原则扩展到自监督或强化学习领域，需要寻找**替代性的对齐信号**，例如：\n    > -   **跨rollout的一致性**（consistency across rollouts）\n    > -   基于**价值函数**（value-based）或**优势函数**（advantage-based）的加权\n    >\n    > 这些方向将为 `DiG-Flow` 在更广泛的学习范式中应用打开大门。",
