However, their performance often degrades under distribution shift and on complex multi-step tasks, suggesting that the learned representations may not robustly capture task-relevant semantics. We introduce\nDiG-Flow\n, a principled framework that enhances VLA robustness through geometric regularization. Our key insight is that the distributional discrepancy between observation and action embeddings provides a meaningful geometric signal: lower transport cost indicates compatible representations, while higher cost suggests potential misalignment.\nDiG-Flow\ncomputes a discrepancy measure between empirical distributions of observation and action embeddings, maps it to a modulation weight via a monotone function, and applies residual updates to the observation embeddings before flow matching. Crucially, this intervention operates at the representation level without modifying the flow matching path or target vector field. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that discrepancy-guided training provably decreases the training objective, and that guided inference refinement converges with contraction. Empirically,\nDiG-Flow\nintegrates into existing VLA architectures with negligible overhead and consistently improves performance, with particularly pronounced gains on complex multi-step tasks and under limited training data.\n\\checkdata\n[Date]Dec 1, 2025\n2\n2\nfootnotetext:\nCorrespondence to Zongqing Lu\n<\n<\nlu@beingbeyond.com\n>\n>\n.\n1\nIntroduction\nVision-Language-Action models represent a paradigm shift in robotic learning by leveraging pretrained vision-language representations to enable flexible, instruction-following manipulation policies\n[\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n]\n. By combining powerful vision-language backbones with flow matching or diffusion-based action generation, these models have achieved impressive success across diverse tasks. However, recent studies reveal concerning fragility: performance degrades substantially under modest distribution shifts such as lighting changes, texture variations, or camera angle perturbations\n[\n2\n,\n4\n]\n. This problem is particularly pronounced on complex tasks where sequential decisions compound, and errors in early steps cascade into failure.\nThe fundamental question is whether the learned representations robustly capture task-relevant semantics or inadvertently encode spurious patterns. Flow matching provides an elegant framework for learning action distributions by regressing neural vector fields\n[\n5\n,\n3\n]\n, yet the regression objective alone may not sufficiently incentivize semantically grounded representations. We propose a complementary perspective: the geometric relationship between observation features and action embeddings reveals representational quality. When observation features from the vision-language backbone and action embeddings from the policy head exhibit low distributional discrepancy, their representations are geometrically compatible, suggesting semantic coherence. Conversely, high discrepancy signals potential misalignment that may indicate spurious patterns or out-of-distribution observations.\nTo solve this problem, we introduce the\nDiG-Flow\nframework with 3 main components: a discrepancy function that quantifies distributional distance, a monotone weight mapping that transforms discrepancy into a modulation factor, and a lightweight residual operator that adjusts observation features. The framework defaults to Wasserstein distance for its geometric interpretability but accommodates alternative discrepancies. Importantly,\nDiG-Flow\nintervenes at the representation level before flow matching, leaving the probability path and target vector field unchanged. This design enables seamless integration into existing architectures while providing theoretical guarantees on training dynamics and inference convergence.\nOur contributions are threefold. First, we establish a discrepancy-guided framework for robust VLA learning. Second, we discuss theoretical motivation for the general problem and provide theoretical guarantee for our method design. Third, we validate that\nDiG-Flow\nconsistently improves performance across both simulation and real-world benchmarks, with pronounced gains on complex multi-step tasks and in data-limited scenarios, while maintaining negligible computational overhead.\n2\nRelated Work\nVision-Language-Action Models.\nVision Language Models (VLMs)\n[\n6\n,\n7\n]\ntypically combine LLM reasoning\n[\n8\n,\n9\n,\n10\n]\nwith modal-specialized encoders\n[\n11\n,\n12\n,\n13\n,\n14\n]\nfor unified multimodal understanding\n[\n15\n,\n16\n]\n.\nPioneering works\n[\n17\n,\n18\n,\n19\n,\n20\n]\ndemonstrated strong few-shot instruction-following capability. With these visual backbones, VLA models extend them to generate robot actions from visual observations and language instructions, representing a paradigm shift in robot learning\n[\n1\n,\n21\n,\n2\n,\n3\n,\n22\n]\n. Early work like RT-1\n[\n1\n]\ndemonstrated transformer-based architectures could scale to diverse tasks, while RT-2\n[\n21\n]\nshowed web-scale vision-language pretraining improves robotic control. Recent advances follow two primary approaches: (1)\nDirect action prediction\n: OpenVLA\n[\n2\n]\nscales to 7B parameters with open-source datasets, Pi0\n[\n3\n]\nand its enhanced version Pi0.5\n[\n4\n]\nuse flow matching for continuous control, while models like Octo\n[\n23\n]\nprovide generalist policies across embodiments; (2)\nVisual prediction\n: PaLM-E\n[\n22\n]\nembeds sensors into language models, GR-3\n[\n24\n,\n25\n]\nuses video pretraining for action generation. Specialized variants address specific challenges: SpatialVLA\n[\n26\n]\nincorporates 3D spatial representations, Otter builds fine-grained visual feature extraction\n[\n27\n]\n, Pi0-Fast\n[\n28\n]\nimproves inference efficiency through action tokenization, gr00t-N1\n[\n29\n]\ntargets humanoid control, and CoT-VLA\n[\n30\n]\nadds visual chain-of-thought reasoning. Being-H0\n[\n31\n]\nincorporates physical instruction tuning for better motion understanding. OneTwoVLA proposes a unified architecture for better adaptive reasoning\n[\n32\n]\n. Despite these advances, long-horizon performance and robustness to distributional drift remain open challenges, which we address through geometric regularization.\nFlow Matching and Optimal Transport.\nFlow Matching\n[\n5\n]\ntrains neural ODEs without simulation, directly learning vector fields that transform distributions. This paradigm improves on Continuous Normalizing Flows\n[\n33\n,\n34\n,\n35\n]\nwhich require expensive ODE solving. Recent developments include Conditional Flow Matching\n[\n36\n]\nfor simplified training with conditional distributions, Rectified Flow\n[\n37\n]\nfor straighter transport paths, and Stochastic Interpolants\n[\n38\n]\nunifying flows and diffusions. OT-CFM\n[\n39\n,\n40\n]\nuses optimal transport for trajectory optimization, finding better paths between distributions at the level of flow matching dynamics.\nOptimal transport theory\n[\n41\n,\n42\n]\nprovides principled tools for comparing distributions geometrically. Computational advances have made OT practical for machine learning: Sinkhorn distances\n[\n43\n]\nadd entropic regularization for efficient approximation, while Sliced Wasserstein\n[\n44\n,\n45\n]\nprojects to 1D for linear complexity in the number of samples. Our key innovation differs from prior OT applications in VLA: rather than using optimal transport to modify the flow matching trajectory (as in OT-CFM), we use Wasserstein distance as an\nauxiliary signal\nto modulate representation learning. This representation-side intervention complements the flow matching objective and enables robustness to distributional drift without altering the fundamental action generation dynamics.\nRobustness in Robot Learning.\nRobustness to distribution shift and spurious correlations has been studied across robot learning contexts\n[\n46\n]\n. Domain randomization techniques\n[\n47\n]\nattempt to improve generalization by training under diverse conditions, while domain adaptation methods\n[\n48\n]\nexplicitly align distributions between source and target environments. Recent work has explored ways to identify and mitigate reliance on spurious features through causal reasoning\n[\n49\n]\nor by learning invariant representations\n[\n50\n]\n. However, these approaches typically operate during training data collection\n[\n51\n]\nor through architectural constraints, rather than providing adaptive mechanisms that respond to distributional drift during deployment. Our geometric modulation approach offers a complementary perspective: by dynamically measuring and responding to observation-action alignment through Wasserstein distance, we enable the model to adjust its behavior as it encounters distributional shift in long-horizon tasks.\n3\nPreliminaries\nFigure 1\n:\nOverview of\nDiG-Flow\nand integration of the\nDiG-Block\n.\n(a)\nWe attach the\nDiG-Block\nin the pretrained VLM backbone. Observations are projected into a shared discrepancy space (\nobs proj.\n), while ground-truth (for training) or predicted actions (for inference) are mapped into the same space (\nact proj.\n).\nFrom these two streams, the block estimates a transport-aware discrepancy\nD\nD\nand converts it into a gate\ng\n=\nϕ\n​\n(\nD\n)\ng=\\phi(D)\n, which softly modulates the backbone features before they are passed to the flow-matching action head.\nThe flow-matching head produces action trajectories from noise as in standard VLA models, and the\nDiG-Refine\nmodule can apply a small number of refinement steps entirely within the action head to further polish the predicted actions.\n(b)\nGiven input embeddings, the backbone first applies standard attention.\nThe post-attention features are then normalized and fed to\nDiG-Block\n, which uses the act/obs projections to compute\nD\n​\n(\nμ\nH\n,\nμ\nZ\n)\nD(\\mu_{H},\\mu_{Z})\nand a gate\ng\ng\n, and performs a gated residual update.\nThis design allows\nDiG-Flow\nto modulate the high-level representation using discrepancy signals from actions, while keeping the pretrained backbone architecture and attention blocks intact.\nWe establish notation and background in this section.\nFlow Matching.\nFlow matching learns a time-dependent vector field\nv\nθ\n​\n(\nx\n,\nt\n)\nv_{\\theta}(x,t)\nfor\nt\n∈\n[\n0\n,\n1\n]\nt\\in[0,1]\nthat transports a base distribution\np\n0\np_{0}\nto a data distribution\np\n1\np_{1}\nvia the ODE:\nd\n​\nx\nt\nd\n​\nt\n=\nv\nθ\n​\n(\nx\nt\n,\nt\n)\n,\nx\n0\n∼\np\n0\n.\n\\frac{dx_{t}}{dt}=v_{\\theta}(x_{t},t),x_{0}\\sim p_{0}.\nTraining minimizes the squared regression loss against a target vector field\nv\n⋆\nv^{\\star}\n:\nℒ\n​\n(\nθ\n)\n=\n𝔼\nt\n,\nx\n1\n,\nx\n0\n​\n[\n‖\nv\nθ\n​\n(\nx\nt\n,\nt\n)\n−\nv\n⋆\n​\n(\nx\nt\n,\nt\n)\n‖\n2\n]\n,\n\\mathcal{L}(\\theta)=\\mathbb{E}_{t,x_{1},x_{0}}\\big[\\|v_{\\theta}(x_{t},t)-v^{\\star}(x_{t},t)\\|^{2}\\big],\n(1)\nwhere\nx\nt\nx_{t}\ninterpolates between\nx\n0\n∼\np\n0\nx_{0}\\sim p_{0}\nand\nx\n1\n∼\np\n1\nx_{1}\\sim p_{1}\nalong a chosen probability path.\nVLA Architecture and Action Chunks.\nA VLA model processes multimodal observations\no\n=\n(\no\nvis\n,\no\nlang\n,\no\nprop\n)\no=(o_{\\text{vis}},o_{\\text{lang}},o_{\\text{prop}})\ncomprising visual images, language instructions, and proprioceptive states. A vision-language backbone produces observation features:\nH\n=\n(\nh\n1\n,\n…\n,\nh\nT\n)\n∈\nℝ\nT\n×\nd\nH=(h_{1},\\ldots,h_{T})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{T\\times d}\n, where\nT\nT\nis the context length and\nd\nd\nis the feature dimension. Current VLA implementations typically adopt an action chunk formulation: at decision time\nt\nt\n, the policy predicts a sequence of future actions:\na\nt\n:\nt\n+\nK\n−\n1\n=\n(\na\nt\n,\na\nt\n+\n1\n,\n…\n,\na\nt\n+\nK\n−\n1\n)\n∈\nℝ\nK\n×\nd\na\n,\na_{t:t+K-1}=(a_{t},a_{t+1},\\ldots,a_{t+K-1})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{K\\times d_{a}},\n(2)\nwhere\nK\nK\nis the action horizon and\nd\na\nd_{a}\nis the raw action dimension. After executing this chunk, the model re-observes the environment at time\nt\n+\nK\nt+K\nand generates a new chunk, making the policy effectively memoryless between chunks. Flow matching generates these action chunks by conditioning the vector field on observation features:\nv\nθ\n​\n(\nx\n,\nt\n|\nH\n)\nv_{\\theta}(x,t|H)\n.\nAction Embeddings.\nTo enable geometric comparison between observations and actions, we map raw actions to a latent space via an encoder\nf\n:\nℝ\nd\na\n→\nℝ\nd\nf:\\mathbb{R}^{d_{a}}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{d}\n. For a raw action\na\nt\na_{t}\n, we obtain an action embedding:\nz\nt\n=\nf\n​\n(\na\nt\n)\n∈\nℝ\nd\n.\nz_{t}=f(a_{t})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d}.\nDuring training, ground-truth actions from the dataset are encoded to form ground-truth action embeddings\nz\nt\ngt\n=\nf\n​\n(\na\nt\ngt\n)\nz_{t}^{\\text{gt}}=f(a_{t}^{\\text{gt}})\n. During inference, predicted actions are encoded as\nz\n^\nt\n=\nf\n​\n(\na\n^\nt\n)\n\\hat{z}_{t}=f(\\hat{a}_{t})\n. Collecting embeddings over the chunk horizon yields:\nZ\n=\n(\nz\n1\n,\n…\n,\nz\nK\n)\n∈\nℝ\nK\n×\nd\n.\nZ=(z_{1},\\ldots,z_{K})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{K\\times d}.\nThe encoder\nf\nf\nis implemented as a lightweight linear projection and trained jointly with the policy. This design allows observations\nH\nH\nand action embeddings\nZ\nZ\nto reside in a common feature space where geometric comparisons are meaningful.\nGiven feature sequences\nH\n∈\nℝ\nT\n×\nd\nH\\in\\mathbb{R}^{T\\times d}\nand\nZ\n∈\nℝ\nK\n×\nd\nZ\\in\\mathbb{R}^{K\\times d}\n, we form empirical distributions:\nμ\nH\n=\n1\nT\n​\n∑\ni\n=\n1\nT\nδ\nh\ni\n,\nμ\nZ\n=\n1\nK\n​\n∑\nj\n=\n1\nK\nδ\nz\nj\n,\n\\mu_{H}=\\frac{1}{T}\\sum_{i=1}^{T}\\delta_{h_{i}},\\quad\\mu_{Z}=\\frac{1}{K}\\sum_{j=1}^{K}\\delta_{z_{j}},\n(3)\nwhere\nδ\nx\n\\delta_{x}\ndenotes a Dirac mass at\nx\nx\n. These distributions enable us to quantify the geometric relationship between observations and actions via distributional discrepancy measures.\n4\nMethod\nWe present\nDiG-Flow\n, a framework for enhancing VLA robustness through geometric regularization of representations. Figure\n1\n(a) shows the overall structure: a pretrained vision-language backbone produces multimodal observation tokens, a lightweight\nDiG-Block\nsits at the interface between the backbone and the flow-matching head, and an optional\nDiG-Refine\nmodule operates purely inside the action expert head.\n4.1\nDiscrepancy-guided architecture\nDiscrepancy Function.\nWe define a discrepancy function\nD\n:\n𝒫\n​\n(\nℝ\nd\n)\n×\n𝒫\n​\n(\nℝ\nd\n)\n→\nℝ\n+\nD:\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{R}^{d})\\times\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{R}^{d})\\to\\mathbb{R}_{+}\nthat quantifies the geometric distance between probability distributions. Our default choice is the squared 2-Wasserstein distance:\nD\n​\n(\nμ\nH\n,\nμ\nZ\n)\n=\ninf\nγ\n∈\nΓ\n​\n(\nμ\nH\n,\nμ\nZ\n)\n∫\n‖\nx\n−\ny\n‖\n2\n​\n𝑑\nγ\n​\n(\nx\n,\ny\n)\n,\nD(\\mu_{H},\\mu_{Z})=\\inf_{\\gamma\\in\\Gamma(\\mu_{H},\\mu_{Z})}\\int\\|x-y\\|^{2}\\,d\\gamma(x,y),\n(4)\nwhere\nΓ\n​\n(\nμ\nH\n,\nμ\nZ\n)\n\\Gamma(\\mu_{H},\\mu_{Z})\ndenotes the set of couplings between\nμ\nH\n\\mu_{H}\nand\nμ\nZ\n\\mu_{Z}\n. The Wasserstein distance provides a geometrically meaningful measure of distributional alignment: lower transport cost indicates that observation and action representations are compatible, while higher cost suggests potential misalignment.\nFor computational efficiency, we approximate\nW\n2\n2\nW_{2}^{2}\nusing the sliced Wasserstein distance. We sample\nM\nM\nrandom unit directions\nω\n1\n,\n…\n,\nω\nM\n∼\nUniform\n​\n(\n𝕊\nd\n−\n1\n)\n\\omega_{1},\\ldots,\\omega_{M}\\sim\\text{Uniform}(\\mathbb{S}^{d-1})\nand compute:\nD\n​\n(\nμ\nH\n,\nμ\nZ\n)\n≈\n1\nM\n​\n∑\nm\n=\n1\nM\nW\n2\n2\n​\n(\n(\nω\nm\n⊤\n)\n#\n​\nμ\nH\n,\n(\nω\nm\n⊤\n)\n#\n​\nμ\nZ\n)\n,\nD(\\mu_{H},\\mu_{Z})\\approx\\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{m=1}^{M}W_{2}^{2}\\big((\\omega_{m}^{\\top})_{\\#}\\mu_{H},(\\omega_{m}^{\\top})_{\\#}\\mu_{Z}\\big),\n(5)\nwhere\n(\nω\nm\n⊤\n)\n#\n​\nμ\n(\\omega_{m}^{\\top})_{\\#}\\mu\ndenotes the pushforward of\nμ\n\\mu\nunder projection onto\nω\nm\n\\omega_{m}\n. Each 1D Wasserstein distance is computed via the quantile formula:\nW\n2\n2\n​\n(\n(\nω\nm\n⊤\n)\n#\n​\nμ\nH\n,\n(\nω\nm\n⊤\n)\n#\n​\nμ\nZ\n)\n=\n∫\n0\n1\n|\nF\nH\n−\n1\n​\n(\nu\n)\n−\nF\nZ\n−\n1\n​\n(\nu\n)\n|\n2\n​\n𝑑\nu\n,\nW_{2}^{2}\\big((\\omega_{m}^{\\top})_{\\#}\\mu_{H},(\\omega_{m}^{\\top})_{\\#}\\mu_{Z}\\big)=\\int_{0}^{1}|F_{H}^{-1}(u)-F_{Z}^{-1}(u)|^{2}du,\n(6)\nwhich reduces to sorting projected features and computing mean squared differences. Alternative discrepancies such as Sinkhorn divergence, maximum mean discrepancy, or cosine distance can be substituted within the same framework.\nWeight Mapping.\nWe map the discrepancy to a modulation weight via a monotone decreasing function\nϕ\n:\nℝ\n+\n→\n[\ng\nmin\n,\n1\n]\n\\phi:\\mathbb{R}_{+}\\to[g_{\\min},1]\n.\nConcretely, we use an exponentially decaying map with a lower clip:\ng\n=\nϕ\n​\n(\nD\n)\n=\nmax\n⁡\n{\ng\nmin\n,\nexp\n⁡\n(\n−\nτ\n​\nD\n)\n}\n,\ng=\\phi(D)=\\max\\{g_{\\min},\\exp(-\\tau D)\\},\n(7)\nwhere\nτ\n>\n0\n\\tau>0\nis a temperature parameter and\ng\nmin\n∈\n(\n0\n,\n1\n)\ng_{\\min}\\in(0,1)\nprevents the gate from vanishing even for large discrepancies.\nLow-discrepancy (well-aligned) pairs thus receive weights close to\n1\n1\n, while high-discrepancy pairs are down-weighted but still retain a non-zero contribution.\nThe map\nϕ\n\\phi\nis monotone decreasing and Lipschitz continuous, matching Assumption\n8.1\n.\nResidual Operator.\nWe define a lightweight residual operator\nℛ\n:\nℝ\nT\n×\nd\n→\nℝ\nT\n×\nd\n\\mathcal{R}:\\mathbb{R}^{T\\times d}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{T\\times d}\nthat transforms observation features.

Some of these solutions correspond to semantically meaningful alignments between observations and actions (\nblue\ndistribution), while others exploit spurious correlations or shortcuts (\nred\ndistribution).\nDiG-Flow\nmeasures the Wasserstein distance\nD\nD\nbetween observation and action features to distinguish these pathways.

In this way,\nDiG-Flow\npushes more intelligence toward the foundation model\n, making VLAs generate more robust actions for general manipulation.\nThe previous subsection establishes that the gated objective\nJ\n​\n(\nθ\n)\nJ(\\theta)\nis smooth, that the residual update yields improvement for\nλ\n\\lambda\nin a nontrivial interval, and that the refinement field defines a contraction. We now give a more explicit intuition in terms of how the discrepancy-controlled gate with above properties reshapes the loss landscape.\nDataset decomposition by discrepancy.\nLet\nD\n​\n(\nH\n,\nZ\n)\nD(H,Z)\ndenote the discrepancy between observation features and action embeddings for a particular sample, and let\ng\n=\nϕ\n​\n(\nD\n)\ng=\\phi(D)\nwith\nϕ\n\\phi\nmonotone decreasing. Consider partitioning the dataset into two regions:\n𝒜\n\\displaystyle\\mathcal{A}\n=\n{\n(\nH\n,\nZ\n)\n:\nD\n​\n(\nH\n,\nZ\n)\n≤\nδ\n}\n(geometrically aligned)\n,\n\\displaystyle=\\{(H,Z):D(H,Z)\\leq\\delta\\}\\quad\\text{(geometrically aligned)},\n(19)\n𝒮\n\\displaystyle\\mathcal{S}\n=\n{\n(\nH\n,\nZ\n)\n:\nD\n​\n(\nH\n,\nZ\n)\n>\nδ\n}\n(geometrically misaligned / shortcut-like)\n,\n\\displaystyle=\\{(H,Z):D(H,Z)>\\delta\\}\\quad\\text{(geometrically misaligned / shortcut-like)},\n(20)\nfor some threshold\nδ\n>\n0\n\\delta>0\n.

Thus, even if the raw gradients\n𝔼\n​\n[\n∇\nθ\nℓ\n∣\n𝒜\n]\n\\mathbb{E}[\\nabla_{\\theta}\\ell\\mid\\mathcal{A}]\nand\n𝔼\n​\n[\n∇\nθ\nℓ\n∣\n𝒮\n]\n\\mathbb{E}[\\nabla_{\\theta}\\ell\\mid\\mathcal{S}]\nhave comparable magnitudes, the effective contributions to the gated gradient in (\n24\n) are reweighted by the expected gates. As optimization proceeds,\nJ\n​\n(\nθ\n)\nJ(\\theta)\ntherefore behaves as if it were more strongly influenced by the aligned region\n𝒜\n\\mathcal{A}\nand less by the shortcut region\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\n.\nConnection to the residual update condition.\nThe residual update analysis for Theorem\n5.1\nuses the alignment condition\n𝔼\n​\n[\ng\n​\n⟨\n∇\nH\nℓ\n​\n(\nθ\n;\nH\n,\nt\n)\n,\nℛ\n​\n(\nH\n)\n⟩\n]\n≤\n−\nα\n0\n.\n\\mathbb{E}\\big[g\\,\\langle\\nabla_{H}\\ell(\\theta;H,t),\\mathcal{R}(H)\\rangle\\big]\\;\\leq\\;-\\alpha_{0}.\n(26)\nUsing the same decomposition\n𝒜\n∪\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{A}\\cup\\mathcal{S}\n, this can be rewritten as\np\n𝒜\n​\n𝔼\n​\n[\ng\n​\n⟨\n∇\nH\nℓ\n​\n(\nθ\n;\nH\n,\nt\n)\n,\nℛ\n​\n(\nH\n)\n⟩\n∣\n𝒜\n]\n+\np\n𝒮\n​\n𝔼\n​\n[\ng\n​\n⟨\n∇\nH\nℓ\n​\n(\nθ\n;\nH\n,\nt\n)\n,\nℛ\n​\n(\nH\n)\n⟩\n∣\n𝒮\n]\n≤\n−\nα\n0\n.\np_{\\mathcal{A}}\\,\\mathbb{E}\\big[g\\,\\langle\\nabla_{H}\\ell(\\theta;H,t),\\mathcal{R}(H)\\rangle\\mid\\mathcal{A}\\big]+p_{\\mathcal{S}}\\,\\mathbb{E}\\big[g\\,\\langle\\nabla_{H}\\ell(\\theta;H,t),\\mathcal{R}(H)\\rangle\\mid\\mathcal{S}\\big]\\leq-\\alpha_{0}.\n(27)\nIf the residual operator\nℛ\n\\mathcal{R}\nis designed to follow the descent direction of the flow-matching loss on aligned samples (so that\n𝔼\n​\n[\n⟨\n∇\nH\nℓ\n,\nℛ\n​\n(\nH\n)\n⟩\n∣\n𝒜\n]\n<\n0\n\\mathbb{E}[\\langle\\nabla_{H}\\ell,\\mathcal{R}(H)\\rangle\\mid\\mathcal{A}]<0\n), then the gate\ng\ng\nfurther amplifies these contributions relative to those from\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\n. Intuitively, the residual update “trusts” the directions suggested by geometrically consistent pairs and downweights those arising from high-discrepancy configurations. This is exactly the intuition formalized in Theorem\n5.1\n: for small enough\nλ\n\\lambda\n, the first-order improvement from aligned regions dominates the second-order smoothness penalty.\nRefinement as gated fixed-point iteration.\nFinally, the refinement operator\nT\n​\n(\nZ\n)\n=\nZ\n−\nα\n​\nE\n​\n(\nZ\n;\ng\n)\nT(Z)=Z-\\alpha\\,E(Z;g)\ncan be viewed as a fixed-point iteration on the space of action embeddings. Under strong monotonicity and Lipschitz regularity, Theorem\n5.1\nshows that\nT\nT\nis a contraction. In practice, this means that once the gate\ng\ng\nhas identified “reliable” observation–action configurations, the refinement map can iteratively pull predicted actions toward a geometry-consistent fixed point\nZ\n⋆\nZ^{\\star}\nwithout exploding or oscillating. The contraction rate\nρ\n<\n1\n\\rho<1\nquantifies how quickly refinement concentrates probability mass around\nZ\n⋆\nZ^{\\star}\n.\nFigure\n3\nsummarizes the overall picture: discrepancy-guided gating reshapes the effective gradient contributions of different regions of the data space, the residual update exploits this reweighting to improve features in a controlled range of strengths, and the refinement operator provides a stable way to further align actions with observation geometry at inference time.\n5.3\nApproximation stability of transport-based discrepancy\nFinally, we discuss how the theoretical guarantees behave when the exact 2-Wasserstein distance is replaced by practical approximations such as sliced Wasserstein or Sinkhorn divergence.\nSliced Wasserstein concentration.\nAssume that observation and action embeddings lie in a bounded ball of radius\nR\nR\nin\nℝ\nd\n\\mathbb{R}^{d}\n. For each random projection direction\nω\nm\n∈\n𝕊\nd\n−\n1\n\\omega_{m}\\in\\mathbb{S}^{d-1}\n, the corresponding one-dimensional Wasserstein distance between the projected empirical measures is bounded by\n(\n2\n​\nR\n)\n2\n(2R)^{2}\n. The sliced Wasserstein estimator averages\nM\nM\nsuch terms, so by Hoeffding’s inequality, for any\nϵ\n>\n0\n\\epsilon>0\n,\nPr\n⁡\n[\n|\nD\n^\n−\n𝔼\n​\n[\nD\n^\n]\n|\n>\nϵ\n]\n≤\n2\n​\nexp\n⁡\n(\n−\nM\n​\nϵ\n2\n2\n⋅\n(\n2\n​\nR\n)\n4\n)\n.\n\\Pr\\!\\big[\\,|\\widehat{D}-\\mathbb{E}[\\widehat{D}]|>\\epsilon\\,\\big]\\;\\leq\\;2\\exp\\!\\Bigl(-\\frac{M\\epsilon^{2}}{2\\cdot(2R)^{4}}\\Bigr).\n(28)\nThus the estimation error scales as\nO\n​\n(\nM\n−\n1\n/\n2\n)\nO(M^{-1/2})\nwith high probability. Since the gate is obtained via a Lipschitz weight map\ng\n=\nϕ\n​\n(\nD\n)\ng=\\phi(D)\nwith constant\nL\nϕ\nL_{\\phi}\n(Assumption\n8.1\n), we have\n|\ng\n−\n𝔼\n​\n[\ng\n]\n|\n=\n|\nϕ\n​\n(\nD\n^\n)\n−\nϕ\n​\n(\n𝔼\n​\n[\nD\n^\n]\n)\n|\n≤\nL\nϕ\n​\n|\nD\n^\n−\n𝔼\n​\n[\nD\n^\n]\n|\n,\n|g-\\mathbb{E}[g]|\\;=\\;|\\phi(\\widehat{D})-\\phi(\\mathbb{E}[\\widehat{D}])|\\;\\leq\\;L_{\\phi}\\,|\\widehat{D}-\\mathbb{E}[\\widehat{D}]|,\n(29)\nso the gate error inherits the same\nO\n​\n(\nM\n−\n1\n/\n2\n)\nO(M^{-1/2})\nconcentration rate. In turn, the descent and contraction inequalities in Theorems\n5.1\n–\n5.1\nremain valid up to multiplicative constants that depend smoothly on\nL\nϕ\nL_{\\phi}\n.\nSinkhorn divergence.\nFor the Sinkhorn divergence\nS\nε\nS_{\\varepsilon}\nwith entropic regularization\nε\n>\n0\n\\varepsilon>0\n, standard results on entropic optimal transport show that\n|\nS\nε\n−\nW\n2\n2\n|\n≤\nb\n​\n(\nε\n)\n,\nb\n​\n(\nε\n)\n→\n0\n​\nas\n​\nε\n→\n0\n,\n\\big|S_{\\varepsilon}-W_{2}^{2}\\big|\\;\\leq\\;b(\\varepsilon),\\quad b(\\varepsilon)\\to 0\\text{ as }\\varepsilon\\to 0,\n(30)\nand empirical estimators of\nS\nε\nS_{\\varepsilon}\nconcentrate around their population values at rate\nO\n​\n(\nn\n−\n1\n/\n2\n)\nO(n^{-1/2})\nin the number of samples\nn\nn\n, with constants depending on\nε\n\\varepsilon\n. Propagating this perturbation through the Lipschitz map\nϕ\n\\phi\nagain yields a bounded perturbation of the gate:\n|\nϕ\n​\n(\nS\n^\nε\n)\n−\nϕ\n​\n(\nW\n2\n2\n)\n|\n≤\nL\nϕ\n​\n(\nb\n​\n(\nε\n)\n+\nC\n​\n(\nε\n)\n​\nn\n−\n1\n/\n2\n)\n,\n\\big|\\phi(\\widehat{S}_{\\varepsilon})-\\phi(W_{2}^{2})\\big|\\;\\leq\\;L_{\\phi}\\Bigl(b(\\varepsilon)+C(\\varepsilon)\\,n^{-1/2}\\Bigr),\n(31)\nfor some constant\nC\n​\n(\nε\n)\nC(\\varepsilon)\n. Consequently, using Sinkhorn divergence instead of exact Wasserstein distance only affects the numerical constants in our bounds; the qualitative guarantees (existence of a positive descent region in\nλ\n\\lambda\n, and contraction of the fixed-gate refinement) remain unchanged.\n6\nExperiments\nWe evaluate\nDiG-Flow\non challenging robotic manipulation benchmarks to assess its ability to improve robustness and generalization.\nOur experiments are designed to answer three questions:\n1.\nDoes discrepancy-guided flow matching improve VLA performance?\n2.\nHow does\nDiG-Flow\ncompare to state-of-the-art VLA baselines?\n3.\nWhich design choices of\nDiG-Flow\nare most important?\nTo demonstrate that\nDiG-Flow\nis backbone-agnostic, we select two of the most widely used flow-matching based VLA models,\ni.e\n.,\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n[\n4\n]\nand GR00T-N1\n[\n29\n]\n, as backbone architectures to evaluate the effectiveness of\nDiG-Flow\nacross different model designs. For\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n, we follow the official default configuration. We then insert\nDiG-Block\nbefore the final transformer layer of the VLM backbone, sharing the same observation features as the original policy head. For GR00T-N1, we use the standard tabletop configuration and insert\nDiG-Block\nat the final token representation used by the action head. In both models,\nDiG-Block\noperates purely at the representation level and does not modify the underlying flow-matching architecture or training objective. We refer to the two variants as\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n-\nDiG\nand GR00T-N1-\nDiG\n, respectively.\n6.1\nSimulation Experiments\n6.1.1\nExperimental Setup\nLIBERO Benchmark.\nLIBERO\n[\n52\n]\nis a standardized benchmark for tabletop robotic manipulation with language-conditioned tasks. It consists of four 10-task suites: LIBERO-Spatial (spatial reasoning and object placement), LIBERO-Object (diverse object properties and appearances), LIBERO-Goal (goal-conditioned instructions), and LIBERO-Long (long-horizon, multi-step tasks). Models are evaluated by success rate over 50 rollouts per task, following the official protocol.\nRoboCasa Benchmark.\nRoboCasa\n[\n53\n]\nis a scalable household robotics simulation platform built on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, providing photorealistic kitchen scenes and diverse manipulation tasks such as pick-and-place, opening cabinets, and interacting with appliances. We follow the 24 atomic manipulation tasks used in prior work on RoboCasa tabletop evaluation, which group naturally into three categories: (i) pick-and-place, (ii) opening and closing doors or drawers, and (iii) other manipulation skills such as pressing buttons or sliding objects. Each task comes with 50 human demonstrations and thousands of additional synthetic rollouts; to stress generalization in a low-data regime,\nwe train all models using only 50 demonstrations per task\n(one trajectory per demonstration), leaving the synthetic data unused.\nTraining details.\nUnless otherwise specified, we use the same optimizer and data pipeline as the corresponding backbone. For\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n-DiG on LIBERO, we train for 30K steps using AdamW with a global batch size of 256 across 8 A100 GPUs, a peak learning rate of\n5\n×\n10\n−\n5\n5\\times 10^{-5}\n, and cosine decay. The flow-matching head follows the standard squared regression loss and training-time enhancement. By default, our\nDiG-Block\nmodules use 32 sliced projections for the discrepancy, a temperature of\nτ\n=\n1.0\n\\tau=1.0\n, residual strength\nλ\n=\n0.4\n\\lambda=0.4\n, and a spectral norm bound of\nB\nℛ\n=\n2.0\nB_{\\mathcal{R}}=2.0\n. For GR00T-N1-\nDiG\n, we follow the official GR00T-N1 training and evaluation protocol and similarly enable\nDiG-Block\nduring fine-tuning.\n6.1.2\nMain Results on LIBERO\nTable\n1\nshows that\nDiG-Flow\nimproves both backbones and achieves state-of-the-art results on LIBERO.

This suite contains long-horizon, multi-step tasks, so the improvement supports our hypothesis that discrepancy-guided modulation reduces error accumulation by encouraging semantically aligned representations.\nTable 1\n:\nSuccess rates (%) on LIBERO.\nWe report mean success over 50 evaluation episodes per task.\nDiG-Flow\nconsistently improves both the\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\nand GR00T-N1 backbones.

Again, the gain is most pronounced on LIBERO-Long (\n90.6\n%\n→\n92.1\n%\n90.6\\%\\!\\to\\!92.1\\%\n), suggesting that\nDiG-Flow\nconsistently helps different architectures handle long-horizon reasoning. Importantly, the relative ordering of backbones is preserved:\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n-DiG remains stronger than GR00T-N1-DiG, indicating that\nDiG-Flow\nacts as a plug-and-play robustness layer rather than fundamentally changing the underlying policy capacity.\n6.1.3\nMain Results on RoboCasa (Few-Shot)\nRoboCasa poses a substantially harder generalization challenge than LIBERO: scenes are more diverse, the observation space is more visually complex, and most tasks involve contact-rich manipulation in cluttered kitchens. Moreover, our training regime is intentionally low-data, using only 50 demonstrations per task, which is roughly the number of human demonstrations provided per atomic task in the official benchmark.\nAs shown in Table\n2\n,\nDiG-Flow\nyields large gains in this setting. For\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n, integrating\nDiG-Flow\nimproves the average success rate from\n41.4\n%\n41.4\\%\nto\n52.6\n%\n52.6\\%\n(\n+\n11.2\n+11.2\npoints). Improvements are visible in all three categories, but are especially pronounced for door/drawer manipulation (\n+\n15.6\n+15.6\npoints), where precise contact and long-horizon geometry are critical. GR00T-N1 also benefits: GR00T-N1-DiG improves the average success rate from\n36.0\n%\n36.0\\%\nto\n43.2\n%\n43.2\\%\n(\n+\n7.2\n+7.2\npoints). The fact that both backbones gain substantially from the same\nDiG-Flow\nmodule, under severely limited data, reinforces our interpretation of discrepancy as a useful geometric regularizer that reduces overfitting to spurious correlations.\nTable 2\n:\nRoboCasa 24-task benchmark with 50 demonstrations per task.\nWe report success rates (%) averaged within categories and across all tasks.

These perturbations apply time-varying sinusoidal noise to both visual observations and proprioceptive states:\nc\n1\n​\ncos\n⁡\n(\nc\n2\n​\nt\n)\n,\nc\n3\n​\nsin\n⁡\n(\nc\n4\n​\nt\n)\nc_{1}\\cos(c_{2}t),c_{3}\\sin(c_{4}t)\n, with coefficients\nc\ni\n∼\n𝒩\n​\n(\n0.01\n,\n0.5\n)\nc_{i}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0.01,0.5)\n. Such perturbations are designed to disrupt brittle correlations that depend on static visual patterns or stereotyped trajectories, while leaving the underlying task semantics intact.\nTable 3\n:\nRobustness to non-stationary perturbations.\nSuccess rates (%) under different time-varying noise patterns that disrupt memorized shortcuts.\nDiG-Flow\nshows consistent improvements across perturbation types, with the most significant gains on complex long-horizon tasks.\nPerturbation\nMethod\nLIBERO-Spatial\nLIBERO-Object\nLIBERO-Goal\nLIBERO-Long\nAvg\nCosine only\nw/o\nDiG-Flow\n87.6\n89.8\n86.4\n70.2\n83.5\nw/\nDiG-Flow\n87.4\n-0.2%\n89.8\n0%\n91.6\n+6.0%\n80.0\n+14.0%\n87.2\n+4.4%\nSine only\nw/o\nDiG-Flow\n88.2\n88.4\n87.2\n68.6\n83.1\nw/\nDiG-Flow\n90.0\n+2.0%\n90.6\n+2.5%\n91.2\n+4.6%\n80.4\n+17.2%\n88.1\n+6.0%\nCosine + sine\nw/o\nDiG-Flow\n87.8\n87.2\n86.0\n67.8\n82.2\nw/\nDiG-Flow\n86.4\n-1.6%\n88.2\n+1.1%\n90.8\n+5.6%\n79.2\n+16.8%\n86.2\n+4.0%\nAs shown in Table\n3\n,\nDiG-Flow\nconsistently improves robustness across all perturbation types, with average gains between roughly 4–6 points. The improvements are most dramatic on LIBERO-Long, where long-horizon execution is particularly sensitive to small systematic biases. Spatial suites show smaller changes, and in a few cases performance is slightly reduced, reflecting that not all perturbations exclusively target shortcuts. Overall, these results support the view that discrepancy-guided gating makes policies less reliant on brittle, non-stationary correlations and more grounded in the geometric relationship between observations and actions.\n6.2\nReal Robot Experiments\n6.2.1\nReal Robot Setup\nFigure 4\n:\n(a)\nReal robot hardware setup (single-arm + dexterous hand.\n(b)\nExamples of real robot tasks. The two rows correspond to the two camera views.\nWe build a real robot setup similar to LIBERO and RoboCasa to validate our experiments in a more challenging real-world physical environment. We use a 7-DoF Franka Research 3 (FR3) arm equipped with a 6-DoF Inspire dexterous hand. Perception is provided by two Intel RealSense cameras mounted at complementary viewpoints, forming a stereo-like arrangement that reduces single-view occlusions. Both cameras stream synchronized RGB frames. The VLM backbone receives a fused representation of these views together with proprioceptive inputs (joint positions, velocities, and gripper states). Commands are sent to the low-level controller at 20 Hz. Following the chunked-action protocol, the policy outputs action chunks over a short horizon, which are then executed in open-loop without additional model-predictive control or trajectory optimization. The overall hardware layout is illustrated in Figure\n4\n(a).\nCompared to a simple two-finger gripper, the dexterous hand substantially increases the control dimensionality and contact complexity: the policy must not only reach the correct pose, but also coordinate multiple finger joints for stable power and precision grasps, tool operation (\ne.g\n., spraying, wiping), and in-hand adjustments. This task setting further exposes policy errors: inaccurate predictions cannot be easily corrected by low-level planners, making robustness and alignment particularly important.\nTo assess real‐world applicability of\nDiG-Flow\n, we design four distinct tasks covering different manipulation challenges. These tasks impose realistic 3D geometry, contact dynamics, and visual complexity, making them ideal for testing the hypothesis that discrepancy-guided modulation improves semantic grounding and robustness. We now detail the four real-robot tasks. These tasks are designed to mirror the difficulty patterns observed in LIBERO and RoboCasa while exposing additional challenges from real-world physics, sensor noise, and human interference. The tasks’ example settings are shown in Figure\n4\n(b).\n•\nStack-Bowls\n: stack bowls from scattered initial positions into a tower; tests precise multi-object grasping and placement, as well as collision avoidance between the hand and previously stacked bowls.\n•\nSpray-Plant\n: pick up a spray bottle and apply water mist to a potted plant along its foliage; tests tool-use behavior, fine motion control, and spatial anticipation to cover the plant surface.\n•\nWipe-Whiteboard\n: use a cloth to erase pen marks from a whiteboard; tests contact-rich surface interaction, maintaining stable pressure, and long-horizon sweeping motions.\n•\nSort-Into-Drawer\n: pick three varied objects and place them into a drawer one by one; tests sequential multi-step reasoning, diverse grasping strategies, and error accumulation over multiple object transfers.\nFor each task we only collect 50 human-teleoperated demonstrations for training, and evaluate for both whole-task success and sub-task success. Stack-Bowls has 5 subtasks, while the other tasks have 3 subtasks each. We report overall success rates and detailed analysis on perturbation and robustness tests.\nFigure 5\n:\nReal robot rollouts on four manipulation tasks.\nEach row shows a successful execution by\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n-DiG from left to right.\n(a)\nStack-Bowls\n: the robot sequentially grasps and stacks three bowls into a stable tower.\n(b)\nSpray-Plant\n: the robot picks up a spray bottle and waters the plant along its foliage.\n(c)\nWipe-Whiteboard\n: the robot wipes away pen marks on the board using a cloth.\n(d)\nSort-Into-Drawer\n: the robot picks and places three objects into a drawer, a long-horizon task that compounds errors across steps.\nThese qualitative rollouts illustrate that\nDiG-Flow\nenables stable multi-step behaviours across diverse contact-rich settings.\nTable 4\n:\nSuccess rates (%) of our models vs baseline on real robot tasks.\nWe show sub-task / whole-task success rates.\nTask\nStack-Bowls\nSpray-Plant\nWipe-Whiteboard\nSort-Into-Drawer\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n(baseline)\n58 / 40\n66 / 45\n62 / 38\n52 / 33\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n-DiG (Ours)\n62\n/\n48\n72\n/\n52\n70\n/\n48\n60\n/\n41\nTable\n4\nshows that\nDiG-Flow\nconsistently improves performance across all four tasks. On the long-horizon Sort-Into-Drawer task, whole-task success increases from 33% to 41% (+8 pts), illustrating that\nDiG-Flow\nhelps mitigate error accumulation in sequential decision chains. The more moderate gains on Spray-Plant and Wipe-Whiteboard reflect shorter horizons but still show benefit, particularly in sub-task success.\n6.2.2\nRobustness Analysis (Real Robot)\nWe next analyze how\nDiG-Flow\nbehaves under real-world perturbations that were not in the training demonstrations. The perturbed setups are illustrated in Figure\n6\n, and the corresponding success rates are reported in Table\n5\n.\nTable 5\n:\nSuccess rates (%) under unseen / perturbed conditions.\nWe show sub-task / whole-task success rates.\nMethod\nStack-Bowls (BG)\nSort-Into-Drawer (BG)\nSpray-Plant (Human)\nWipe-Whiteboard (Human)\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n42 / 15\n48 / 20\n35 / 10\n44 / 20\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n-DiG (Ours)\n65 / 40\n60 / 35\n62 / 30\n58 / 30\nFigure 6\n:\nUnseen and interfered real-world settings.\nWe evaluate robustness under\n(a)\nBackground Shifts\n, where table textures, cloths, and distractor objects are changed for Stack-Bowls and Sort-Into-Drawer, and\n(b)\nHuman Interference\n, where a human hand moves the plant or writes on the whiteboard during wiping.\nThese perturbations introduce visual and dynamic distribution shifts beyond the training data and correspond to the robustness results in Table\n5\n.\nBackground Shifts.\nFor Stack-Bowls and Sort-Into-Drawer, we change the table cloth color and pattern, add additional objects near the workspace, and vary global lighting conditions. Despite these shifts, our policy with\nDiG-Flow\nmaintains high success rates that are close to the unperturbed setting: most failures are due to rare extreme occlusions rather than systematic mistakes. Qualitatively, we observe that the robot continues to focus on the geometry of task-relevant objects (bowls, drawer, target items) even when the background appearance changes substantially, suggesting that the transport-based gating helps deprioritize accidental correlations with background textures.\nHuman Interference.\nFor Spray-Plant and Wipe-Whiteboard, we introduce a human hand that moves the plant or writes new strokes on the board while the robot is executing the policy. These interventions create both visual distractions and true dynamical changes (targets moving during execution). We find that the policy often adapts by slightly adjusting its trajectory to follow the plant motion or to cover newly written strokes, and overall success remains high relative to the no-interference baseline. Failures typically arise when the human intervention is adversarially timed (\ne.g\n., moving the plant exactly as the robot closes its grasp), which is challenging for any open-loop controller.\nTable\n5\nshows that all four perturbed variants are challenging: both policies see noticeable drops\ncompared to the clean setting, but\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n-DiG remains consistently more\nrobust. On\nStack-Bowls (BG)\nand\nSpray-Plant (Human)\n, the baseline\nwhole-task success falls to\n15\n%\n15\\%\nand\n10\n%\n10\\%\n, while\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n-DiG still\nachieves\n40\n%\n40\\%\nand\n30\n%\n30\\%\n, respectively. Even on the harder long-horizon\nSort-Into-Drawer (BG)\nscenario,\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n-DiG improves whole-task\nsuccess from\n20\n%\n20\\%\nto\n35\n%\n35\\%\n. A similar advantage appears for\nWipe-Whiteboard (Human)\n, where\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n-DiG reaches\n30\n%\n30\\%\nvs.\n20\n%\n20\\%\nfor the baseline. Overall, the relative gap between the two models is preserved\nor enlarged under background and human interference, indicating that\ndiscrepancy-guided modulation helps maintain stable observation-action\nalignment rather than overfitting to specific training scenes.\nOverall, these results support the view that geometry-aware gating improves robustness in the real world: the policy is less sensitive to superficial background statistics and more focused on the observation–action alignment relevant for the task.\n6.2.3\nHigh-DoF Humanoid with Active View Control\nFigure 7\n:\nHigh-DoF humanoid setup.\nOur 31-DoF humanoid platform with dual dexterous hands and an actively controlled head. The head mounts dual RGB cameras, while the torso and arms provide upper-body motion. The task is to clear 1-3 objects from the table into the box. This setting requires the policy to jointly coordinate head, body, and hands, rather than controlling only a low-DoF gripper from a fixed camera.\nTo further stress-test\nDiG-Flow\non more complex embodiments, we deploy\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\nand\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n-DiG on a 31-DoF upper-body humanoid platform equipped with dual dexterous hands and an actively controlled head camera. As illustrated in Figure\n7\n, the robot has independently actuated joints for the torso, neck, arms, and multi-finger hands, resulting in substantially higher dimensionality and contact complexity than traditional real-robot experiments. Unlike prior VLA settings that operate from a fixed third-person view and control only a low-DoF end-effector, our policy must simultaneously coordinate head,\nbody, and both hands, making both state estimation and control more challenging.\nThe head houses a pair of RGB cameras that provide an egocentric, movable viewpoint. During teleoperation, the operator naturally moves the head to obtain task-relevant views. The policy is trained to imitate this behavior and thus learns to actively adjust the viewpoint while manipulating objects. Figure\n8\nshows an example rollout: the robot first orients the head to obtain a clear view of the workspace, then uses dexterous hands to pick up objects and place them into a box while continuously refining its viewing angle. This active-view setup is particularly sensitive to representation misalignment.\nFigure 8\n:\nEgocentric active-view rollouts.\nExample sequence from the head-mounted camera during a clean-up episode. The humanoid first adjusts its viewpoint to obtain a clear observation of the workspace, then successively grasps objects with its dexterous hands and places them into the box.\nDiG-Flow\nhelps maintain robust observation–action alignment under camera motion and self-occlusions.\nWe collect 1000 teleoperated demonstrations of general tabletop clean-up tasks, where the robot is instructed to place 1-3 objects on the table into a box from diverse initial layouts.\nBoth\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\nand\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n-DiG are trained on this dataset with a batch size of 256 for 20K training steps, using the same flow-matching configuration as in our other real-robot experiments. We evaluate each model on 20 rollouts per condition, and report success rates in Table\n6\n. The “Seen” setting uses the same object categories and background\nas training, while the “Unseen” setting replaces both objects and background textures to induce distribution shift.\nTable 6\n:\nSuccess rates (%) on high-DoF humanoid clean-up tasks.\nEach entry reports the success rate over 20 evaluation rollouts for clearing 1-3 objects into the box. “Seen” uses the same object categories and background as the demonstrations, while “Unseen” uses novel objects and background textures.\nSeen\nUnseen & Perturbed\nMethod\n1 obj\n2 objs\n3 objs\n1 obj\n2 objs\n3 objs\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n75\n60\n35\n55\n30\n25\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n-DiG\n75\n65\n45\n65\n45\n40\nOn this challenging real-robot setting, the standard\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\nbaseline achieves only moderate performance, particularly when the scene contains multiple objects or unseen visual conditions. In contrast,\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n-DiG consistently improves success rates by 5-10 points across seen objects and backgrounds. As for unseen objects and background shift, the gains are even more pronounced. The advantages brought by\nDiG-Flow\nare also more obvious in complex multi-object tasks.\nThese results indicate that discrepancy-guided modulation remains effective even when the policy coordinates a high-DoF humanoid with active view control, providing both stronger performance and more robust behavior under visual and dynamical perturbations.\n6.3\nFurther Discussion on Method Design\nIn this section, we further explain the method design of\nDiG-Flow\nthrough ablation studies and mechanism analyses on the standard LIBERO benchmark.\n6.3.1\nDiscrepancy and Gating Ablations\nOur method has two key design choices: the discrepancy\nD\n​\n(\nμ\nH\n,\nμ\nZ\n)\nD(\\mu_{H},\\mu_{Z})\nthat measures observation–action mismatch, and the scalar gate\ng\n=\nϕ\n​\n(\nD\n)\ng=\\phi(D)\nthat maps this signal back to the backbone.\nWe therefore ablate these two components separately.\nTable 7\n:\nEffect of discrepancy choice on LIBERO (success %).\nAll rows use the same\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\nbackbone, scalar mapping\ng\n=\nexp\n⁡\n(\n−\nτ\n​\nD\n)\ng=\\exp(-\\tau D)\n, and residual operator; only the discrepancy\nD\n​\n(\nμ\nH\n,\nμ\nZ\n)\nD(\\mu_{H},\\mu_{Z})\nis varied.\nWasserstein-based discrepancies provide the strongest signal, especially on LIBERO-Long.\nDiscrepancy\nLIBERO-Spatial\nLIBERO-Object\nLIBERO-Goal\nLIBERO-Long\nAvg\nCosine distance\n98.2\n-1.0%\n97.8\n-1.2%\n97.2\n-1.4%\n92.6\n-3.8%\n96.5\n-1.8%\nMMD (RBF kernel)\n98.4\n-0.8%\n98.2\n-0.8%\n97.6\n-1.0%\n93.4\n-3.0%\n96.8\n-1.5%\nSinkhorn (\nε\n=\n0.1\n\\varepsilon=0.1\n)\n98.8\n-0.4%\n98.6\n-0.4%\n98.2\n-0.4%\n95.8\n-0.6%\n97.9\n-0.4%\nSliced Wasserstein (Ours)\n99.2\n99.0\n98.6\n96.4\n98.3\nTable\n7\nexamines how different discrepancy functions affect performance when applied to\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n-DiG on LIBERO.\nAll variants use the same scalar mapping\ng\n=\nexp\n⁡\n(\n−\nτ\n​\nD\n)\ng=\\exp(-\\tau D)\nand residual operator; only\nD\n​\n(\nμ\nH\n,\nμ\nZ\n)\nD(\\mu_{H},\\mu_{Z})\nis changed.\nNon-transport discrepancies such as cosine distance and MMD already provide moderate gains over the backbone (average\n96.5\n%\n96.5\\%\nand\n96.8\n%\n96.8\\%\n), confirming that even coarse measures of observation–action similarity can be beneficial.\nHowever, Wasserstein-based discrepancies consistently perform better.\nSinkhorn divergence (entropic OT) achieves\n97.9\n%\n97.9\\%\naverage success, while our default sliced 2-Wasserstein distance attains\n98.3\n%\n98.3\\%\nand the best results on LIBERO-Long.\nThis matches our theoretical intuition: Wasserstein distances respect the underlying geometry of the feature space, yielding a more faithful measure of distributional misalignment and a better-behaved supervision signal for the gate.\nTable 8\n:\nComparison of gating mechanisms.\nSuccess rates (%) for different gating strategies with the discrepancy fixed to sliced 2-Wasserstein.\nIn contrast to fixed or random modulation, our transport gate converts the geometric discrepancy into a meaningful confidence signal, yielding the best performance, especially on LIBERO-Long.\nGating Strategy\nLIBERO-Spatial\nLIBERO-Object\nLIBERO-Goal\nLIBERO-Long\nAvg\nFixed Gate (\ng\n=\n0.5\ng=0.5\n)\n96.8\n-2.4%\n95.4\n-3.6%\n92.2\n-6.5%\n84.6\n-12.2%\n92.3\n-6.1%\nRandom Gate (\ng\n∼\n𝒰\n​\n(\n0\n,\n1\n)\ng\\sim\\mathcal{U}(0,1)\n)\n95.2\n-4.0%\n93.8\n-5.3%\n89.4\n-9.3%\n80.8\n-16.2%\n89.8\n-8.7%\nTransport Gate (Ours)\n99.2\n99.0\n98.6\n96.4\n98.3\nTable\n8\ncomplements this study by fixing the sliced 2-Wasserstein discrepancy and varying only the gating mechanism.\nReplacing our transport gate with a fixed scalar (\ng\n=\n0.5\ng=0.5\n) reduces performance to\n92.3\n%\n92.3\\%\naverage success (-6.1%), indicating that uniform feature modulation cannot distinguish between semantically useful and spurious patterns.\nRandom gating performs even worse at\n89.8\n%\n89.8\\%\n(-8.7%), showing that arbitrary feature suppression actively harms learning by disrupting both beneficial and harmful correlations.\nThe degradation is particularly severe on LIBERO-Long (up to -16.2%), where long-horizon reasoning amplifies the effect of shortcut solutions.\nIn contrast, the discrepancy-guided transport gate preserves performance on simpler suites and yields the largest gains on LIBERO-Long, consistent with our interpretation that geometric alignment is most critical in sequential tasks.\nTaken together, Tables\n7\nand\n8\nshow that both the choice of discrepancy and the shape of the gate\nϕ\n​\n(\nD\n)\n\\phi(D)\nmatter for robust optimization.\n6.3.2\nRefinement Ablation\nIn Section\n5.1\n, we state that performance saturates within 3 refinement steps. Here we provide a more detailed analysis of this behavior on the standard LIBERO benchmark.\nFigure 9\n:\nEffect of refinement steps\nN\nrefine\nN_{\\text{refine}}\non LIBERO.\nWe vary the number of refinement iterations at inference time while keeping the training setup fixed.\nEven without refinement (\nN\nrefine\n=\n0\nN_{\\text{refine}}{=}0\n), the discrepancy-guided flow model already surpasses the backbone policy. Adding a small number of refinement steps further improves performance and quickly saturates around\nN\nrefine\n=\n3\nN_{\\text{refine}}{=}3\n.\nFigure\n9\nreports the average LIBERO success rate when we vary the number of refinement iterations\nN\nrefine\nN_{\\text{refine}}\nat test time.\nWe observe three consistent trends:\n•\nPerformance gains even with\nN\nrefine\n=\n0\nN_{\\text{refine}}{=}0\n.\nThe curve shows that the\nN\nrefine\n=\n0\nN_{\\text{refine}}{=}0\nvariant already achieves a strong success rate on LIBERO.\nThis indicates that the discrepancy-guided residual update improves the learned policy itself, rather than only acting as a test-time heuristic.\n•\nFew refinement steps bring stable improvements.\nIncreasing\nN\nrefine\nN_{\\text{refine}}\nfrom 0 to 3 yields consistent performance gains and quickly brings the curve close to saturation.\nThis supports our choice of using\nN\nrefine\n=\n3\nN_{\\text{refine}}{=}3\nby default: it captures most of the benefit of refinement while keeping the additional computation per control step modest.\n•\nBeyond 3 steps, performance saturates with small fluctuations.\nFor\nN\nrefine\n>\n3\nN_{\\text{refine}}>3\n, the success rate fluctuates slightly around the same plateau level, without systematic degradation.\nWe attribute the small variations to evaluation noise and the fact that once the flow model has already produced a near-optimal action chunk, further refinement only provides marginal adjustments.\nOverall, these results confirm that (i)\nDiG-Flow\nis already useful without refinement, and (ii) a small number of refinement steps provides a good trade-off between robustness/performance and inference cost.\n6.3.3\nHyperparameter Analysis\nFigure 10\n:\nHyperparameter sensitivity of\nDiG-Flow\n.\n(a)\nSuccess rate as a function of the number of sliced projections\nK\nK\nused for approximating the Wasserstein discrepancy.\nPerformance improves steadily from very small\nK\nK\nand saturates once\nK\n≈\n28\nK\\approx 28\n–\n32\n32\n, indicating that a moderate number of projections is sufficient for a stable transport estimate.\n(b)\nJoint effect of the residual strength\nλ\n\\lambda\n(in Eq.\n11\n) and the temperature\nτ\n\\tau\nin\ng\n=\nmax\n⁡\n{\ng\nmin\n,\nexp\n⁡\n(\n−\nτ\n​\nD\n)\n}\ng=\\max\\{g_{\\min},\\exp(-\\tau D)\\}\n.\nWe observe a broad plateau around\n(\nλ\n,\nτ\n)\n≈\n(\n0.4\n,\n1.0\n)\n(\\lambda,\\tau)\\approx(0.4,1.0)\nand an elongated ridge roughly following\nλ\n​\nτ\n≈\n0.4\n\\lambda\\tau\\approx 0.4\n, showing that the two hyperparameters jointly control an effective gating strength while still providing some flexibility: increasing\nλ\n\\lambda\ncan be partially compensated by decreasing\nτ\n\\tau\n, and vice versa, but moving too far from the ridge degrades performance.\nFigure\n10\nsummarizes the sensitivity of\nDiG-Flow\nto its main hyperparameters. Panel\n10\n(a) varies the number of sliced projections\nK\nK\nused to approximate the Wasserstein discrepancy. We observe a smooth, monotone improvement as\nK\nK\nincreases from\n4\n4\nto\n20\n20\n, after which performance quickly saturates around\nK\n≈\n28\nK\\approx 28\n–\n32\n32\n. This matches the theoretical trade-off: more projections reduce Monte Carlo variance in the sliced Wasserstein estimate, but beyond a moderate budget the marginal benefit becomes negligible relative to the dominant transformer cost. In all reported experiments we therefore fix\nK\n=\n32\nK=32\n, which lies in the flat regime and offers a good balance between accuracy and overhead.\nPanel\n10\n(b) studies the joint effect of the residual strength\nλ\n\\lambda\n(in Eq.(\n11\n)) and the temperature\nτ\n\\tau\nin the gate\ng\n=\nexp\n⁡\n(\n−\nτ\n​\nD\n)\ng=\\exp(-\\tau D)\n. The heatmap reveals two important properties. First, there is a broad plateau around\n(\nλ\n,\nτ\n)\n≈\n(\n0.4\n,\n1.0\n)\n(\\lambda,\\tau)\\approx(0.4,1.0)\n, indicating that\nDiG-Flow\nis not overly sensitive to small mis-tuning and that our default choice lies in a robust operating region rather than at a sharp optimum. Second, the high-performance region forms an elongated ridge approximately following\nλ\n​\nτ\n≈\nconst\n\\lambda\\tau\\approx\\text{const}\n, which is consistent with the interpretation that\nλ\n\\lambda\nand\nτ\n\\tau\njointly control an effective gating strength\nλ\n​\ng\n​\n(\nτ\n)\n\\lambda g(\\tau)\n: increasing\nλ\n\\lambda\ncan be partially compensated by reducing\nτ\n\\tau\n(which softens the gate), and vice versa. The slight diagonal elongation reflects the fact that the effective step size in feature space scales like\n‖\nH\n~\n−\nH\n‖\nF\n≈\nλ\n​\ng\n​\n‖\nℛ\n​\n(\nH\n)\n‖\nF\n≈\nλ\n​\nmax\n⁡\n{\ng\nmin\n,\nexp\n⁡\n(\n−\nτ\n​\nD\n)\n}\n​\n‖\nℛ\n​\n(\nH\n)\n‖\nF\n,\n\\|\\tilde{H}-H\\|_{F}\\;\\approx\\;\\lambda\\,g\\,\\|\\mathcal{R}(H)\\|_{F}\\;\\approx\\;\\lambda\\,\\max\\{g_{\\min},\\exp(-\\tau D)\\}\\,\\|\\mathcal{R}(H)\\|_{F},\n(32)\nAt the same time, the ridge is not perfectly flat, so\nλ\n\\lambda\nand\nτ\n\\tau\nare not fully redundant. In particular, large\nλ\n\\lambda\nwith aggressive\nτ\n\\tau\ncan lead to over-amplified residuals that violate the small-step assumption in Theorem\n5.1\n, while very small\nλ\n\\lambda\nwith extremely soft gates under-utilizes the residual pathway and reduces the advantage over the baseline. The heatmap therefore supports the theoretical picture: there exists a nontrivial band of\n(\nλ\n,\nτ\n)\n(\\lambda,\\tau)\nvalues where the transport-guided residual update yields consistent gains, and our defaults\n(\nλ\n=\n0.4\n,\nτ\n=\n1.0\n)\n(\\lambda=0.4,\\tau=1.0)\nsit well inside this stable band rather than being a knife-edge configuration.\n6.3.4\nTransport-Cost Dynamics and Gating Behaviour\nFigure 11\n:\nDynamics of the transport discrepancy\nD\n​\n(\nμ\nH\n,\nμ\nZ\n)\nD(\\mu_{H},\\mu_{Z})\nduring training.\nWe plot the average sliced\nW\n2\n2\nW_{2}^{2}\nbetween observation and action embeddings over training\niterations (shaded region indicates variability across batches). The cost decreases steadily in the\nearly phase and then stabilizes in a medium range, instead of collapsing to zero, matching the\nintended role of\nD\nD\nas a discriminative geometric signal rather than a pure minimization target.\nIn addition to task-level success rates, we also monitor the behaviour of the transport discrepancy\nD\n​\n(\nμ\nH\n,\nμ\nZ\n)\nD(\\mu_{H},\\mu_{Z})\nduring training. Figure\n11\nreports the evolution of the\naverage sliced\n2\n2\n-Wasserstein cost between the empirical observation and action embedding\ndistributions over training iterations for\nDiG-Flow\non LIBERO.\nThree observations are worth highlighting.\n(i) Training phases.\nAt the beginning of training the transport cost is relatively high, reflecting the fact that\nobservation features\nH\nH\nand action embeddings\nZ\nZ\nlive in poorly aligned regions of the feature\nspace. As optimisation proceeds,\nD\n​\n(\nμ\nH\n,\nμ\nZ\n)\nD(\\mu_{H},\\mu_{Z})\ndecreases monotonically and then enters a\nsteady-state regime where it fluctuates around a stable value. This behaviour is consistent with\nthe interpretation of\nD\nD\nas measuring semantic compatibility between observation and action\nrepresentations: the model gradually learns to place both in a geometrically coherent region.\n(ii)\nD\nD\nas a signal, not a loss term.\nImportantly, the curve in Figure\n11\ndoes not keep decreasing towards zero.\nInstead, it converges to a medium range where\nD\nD\nis neither vanishing nor exploding. This is\nexactly the regime in which the gate\ng\n=\nmax\n⁡\n{\ng\nmin\n,\nexp\n⁡\n(\n−\nτ\n​\nD\n​\n(\nμ\nH\n,\nμ\nZ\n)\n)\n}\ng\\;=\\;\\max\\bigl\\{g_{\\min},\\exp\\bigl(-\\tau\\,D(\\mu_{H},\\mu_{Z})\\bigr)\\bigr\\}\nretains discriminative power: samples with relatively low discrepancy still receive stronger gates,\nwhile samples with larger discrepancy are down-weighted, but no regime dominates completely.\nDriving\nD\nD\nto (near-)zero would make\ng\n≈\n1\ng\\approx 1\nfor almost all samples and therefore remove\nthe benefit of discrepancy-guided modulation; conversely, extremely large\nD\nD\nwould force\ng\n≈\n0\ng\\approx 0\nand effectively deactivate the residual path.\n(iii) Connection to gated residual theory and hyperparameters.\nThe observed range of\nD\nD\nprovides empirical support for the theoretical assumptions used in\nSection\n5\n. Theorem\n5.1\nrequires that the gated residual update\nH\n~\n=\nH\n+\nλ\n​\ng\n​\nℛ\n​\n(\nH\n)\n\\tilde{H}\\;=\\;H+\\lambda\\,g\\,\\mathcal{R}(H)\nremains in a regime where the first-order improvement term dominates the quadratic penalty\ncontrolled by\nL\nH\nL_{H}\nand\nB\nℛ\nB_{\\mathcal{R}}\n(Assumption\n8.1\n). The fact that\nD\nD\nstabilizes in a moderate range implies that the effective step size (Eq. (\n32\n)) naturally stays within such a “small but non-negligible” band throughout training, matching the\nregime in which Theorem\n5.1\nguarantees expected loss reduction. This also explains the shape of the hyperparameter landscape in\nFigure\n10\n. Since\nD\n​\n(\nμ\nH\n,\nμ\nZ\n)\nD(\\mu_{H},\\mu_{Z})\nconcentrates in a relatively narrow\ninterval once training has converged, there exists a family of\n(\nλ\n,\nτ\n)\n(\\lambda,\\tau)\npairs that produce\nsimilar effective magnitudes of\nλ\n​\ng\n\\lambda g\non typical samples. The broad plateau in\nFigure\n10\n(b) and the smooth one-dimensional curves over\nλ\n\\lambda\nand\nτ\n\\tau\nare consistent with this picture:\nDiG-Flow\nis robust to moderate changes in either\nparameter, as long as the resulting transport cost keeps the gate in the informative middle range\nillustrated in Figure\n11\n.\n7\nConclusions and Limitations\nWe presented\nDiG-Flow\n, a discrepancy-guided flow matching framework that regularizes VLA representations through a simple geometric signal between observation and action embeddings. By mapping this distributional discrepancy to a scalar gate and applying residual updates in feature space,\nDiG-Flow\nleaves the flow-matching path and objective intact while shaping the representations used by the action head. Our analysis shows that the gated objective admits standard descent guarantees, that suitably small residual updates provably reduce the loss under an alignment condition, and that a fixed-gate refinement scheme forms a contraction.\nWhile\nDiG-Flow\ndemonstrates strong performance in both simulation and real-world experiments, several limitations warrant discussion.\nFirst, our theoretical analysis assumes that features have bounded norms (\ne.g\n.,\n‖\nH\n‖\nF\n≤\nR\n\\|H\\|_{F}\\leq R\n). This is reasonable for normalized representations but may require additional scaling or normalization mechanisms when applied to architectures that do not enforce such bounds.\nSecond, the transport distance computation currently relies on batch-level statistics, which can be influenced by outliers or small batch sizes. In principle, this could make the gate slightly sensitive to the composition of a mini-batch. Exploring alternatives such as running statistics, more robust discrepancy measures, or fully instance-wise variants would be an interesting direction for future work.\nFinally,\nDiG-Flow\nuses ground-truth actions during supervised training to compute meaningful observation–action discrepancies. Extending the same principle to self-supervised or reinforcement learning regimes would require alternative alignment signals (\ne.g\n., consistency across rollouts, value-based or advantage-based weighting), which we leave for future research.\nReferences\n[1]\nAnthony Brohan, Noah Brown, Justice Carbajal, Yevgen Chebotar, Joseph Dabis, Chelsea Finn, Keerthana Gopalakrishnan, Karol Hausman, Alex Herzog, Jasmine Hsu, Julian Ibarz, Brian Ichter, Alex Irpan, Tomas Jackson, Sally Jesmonth, Nikhil J Joshi, Ryan Julian, Dmitry Kalashnikov, Yuheng Kuang, Isabel Leal, Kuang-Huei Lee, Sergey Levine, Yao Lu, Utsav Malla, Deeksha Manjunath, Igor Mordatch, Ofir Nachum, Carolina Parada, Jodilyn Peralta, Emily Perez, Karl Pertsch, Jornell Quiambao, Kanishka Rao, Michael Ryoo, Grecia Salazar, Pannag Sanketi, Kevin Sayed, Jaspiar Singh, Sumedh Sontakke, Austin Stone, Clayton Tan, Huong Tran, Vincent Vanhoucke, Steve Vega, Quan Vuong, Fei Xia, Ted Xiao, Peng Xu, Sichun Xu, Tianhe Yu, and Brianna Zitkovich.\nRt-1: Robotics transformer for real-world control at scale, 2023.\n[2]\nMoo Jin Kim, Karl Pertsch, Siddharth Karamcheti, Ted Xiao, Ashwin Baljekar, Suraj Nair, Rafael Rafailov, Ethan Foster, Grace Lam, Pannag Sanketi, et al.\nOpenvla: An open-source vision-language-action model.\narXiv preprint arXiv:2406.09246\n, 2024.\n[3]\nKevin Black, Noah Brown, Danny Driess, Adnan Esmail, Michael Equi, Chelsea Finn, Niccolo Fusai, Lachy Groom, Karol Hausman, Brian Ichter, et al.\nπ\n0\n\\pi_{0}\n: A vision-language-action flow model for general robot control.\narXiv preprint arXiv:2410.24164\n, 2024.\n[4]\nPhysical Intelligence, Kevin Black, Noah Brown, James Darpinian, Karan Dhabalia, Danny Driess, Adnan Esmail, Michael Equi, Chelsea Finn, Niccolo Fusai, et al.\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n: a vision-language-action model with open-world generalization.\narXiv preprint arXiv:2504.16054\n, 2025.\n[5]\nYaron Lipman, Ricky TQ Chen, Heli Ben-Hamu, Maximilian Nickel, and Matt Le.\nFlow matching for generative modeling.\narXiv preprint arXiv:2210.02747\n, 2023.\n[6]\nDeyao Zhu, Jun Chen, Xiaoqian Shen, Xiang Li, and Mohamed Elhoseiny.\nMinigpt-4: Enhancing vision-language understanding with advanced large language models.\narXiv preprint arXiv:2304.10592\n, 2023.\n[7]\nPeng Wang, Shuai Bai, Sinan Tan, Shijie Wang, Zhihao Fan, Jinze Bai, Keqin Chen, Xuejing Liu, Jialin Wang, Wenbin Ge, et al.\nQwen2-vl: Enhancing vision-language model’s perception of the world at any resolution.\narXiv preprint arXiv:2409.12191\n, 2024.\n[8]\nHugo Touvron, Thibaut Lavril, Gautier Izacard, Xavier Martinet, Marie-Anne Lachaux, Timothée Lacroix, Baptiste Rozière, Naman Goyal, Eric Hambro, Faisal Azhar, et al.\nLlama: Open and efficient foundation language models.\narXiv preprint arXiv:2302.13971\n, 2023.\n[9]\nHugo Touvron, Louis Martin, Kevin Stone, Peter Albert, Amjad Almahairi, Yasmine Babaei, Nikolay Bashlykov, Soumya Batra, Prajjwal Bhargava, Shruti Bhosale, et al.\nLlama 2: Open foundation and fine-tuned chat models.\narXiv preprint arXiv:2307.09288\n, 2023.\n[10]\nJinze Bai, Shuai Bai, Yunfei Chu, Zeyu Cui, Kai Dang, Xiaodong Deng, Yang Fan, Wenbin Ge, Yu Han, Fei Huang, et al.\nQwen technical report.\narXiv preprint arXiv:2309.16609\n, 2023.\n[11]\nAlec Radford, Jong Wook Kim, Chris Hallacy, Aditya Ramesh, Gabriel Goh, Sandhini Agarwal, Girish Sastry, Amanda Askell, Pamela Mishkin, Jack Clark, et al.\nLearning transferable visual models from natural language supervision.\nIn\nInternational conference on machine learning\n, pages 8748–8763.

However, their performance often degrades under distribution shift and on complex multi-step tasks, suggesting that the learned representations may not robustly capture task-relevant semantics. We introduce DiG-Flow, a principled framework that enhances VLA robustness through geometric regularization. Our key insight is that the distributional discrepancy between observation and action embeddings provides a meaningful geometric signal: lower transport cost indicates compatible representations, while higher cost suggests potential misalignment. DiG-Flow computes a discrepancy measure between empirical distributions of observation and action embeddings, maps it to a modulation weight via a monotone function, and applies residual updates to the observation embeddings before flow matching. Crucially, this intervention operates at the representation level without modifying the flow matching path or target vector field. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that discrepancy-guided training provably decreases the training objective, and that guided inference refinement converges with contraction. Empirically, DiG-Flow integrates into existing VLA architectures with negligible overhead and consistently improves performance, with particularly pronounced gains on complex multi-step tasks and under limited training data.\n\n\\cthnewtheorem\ntheoremTheorem\n\\cthnewtheorem\nassumptionAssumption\n\\cthnewtheorem\nlemmaLemma\n\\webpage\nhttps://beingbeyond.github.io/DiG-Flow\nDiG-Flow\n: Discrepancy-Guided Flow Matching for Robust VLA Models\nWanpeng Zhang\n1,2\nYe Wang\n2,3\nHao Luo\n1,2\nHaoqi Yuan\n1,2\nYicheng Feng\n1,2\nSipeng Zheng\n2\nQin Jin\n3\nZongqing Lu\n1,2,†\n1\nPeking University\n2\nBeingBeyond\n3\nRenmin University of China\nAbstract\nVision-Language-Action (VLA) models trained with flow matching have demonstrated impressive capabilities on robotic manipulation tas",

            "answer": "## DiG-Flow: Discrepancy-Guided Flow Matching for Robust VLA Models\n\n这篇论文的核心创新在于提出了一种名为 **DiG-Flow** 的框架，旨在解决当前基于流匹配（Flow Matching）的视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型在面对分布偏移和复杂多步任务时鲁棒性不足的根本问题。\n\n### 核心要解决的问题\n\n1.  **脆弱的表示学习 (Fragile Representation Learning)**：现有的VLA模型虽然强大，但其学到的观察（observation）与动作（action）之间的映射关系可能依赖于数据中的“捷径”或虚假相关性（spurious correlations），而非真正稳健的任务语义。这导致模型在遇到光照、纹理、视角等微小变化（分布偏移）时性能急剧下降。\n2.  **长程任务的误差累积 (Error Accumulation in Long-Horizon Tasks)**：在需要多个步骤才能完成的复杂任务中，早期决策的微小错误会不断累积，最终导致任务失败。\n3.  **缺乏对齐的几何信号 (Lack of Geometric Alignment Signal)**：传统的流匹配目标函数专注于回归一个向量场来生成动作，但它本身并不直接鼓励观察特征和动作特征在几何空间上保持一致和兼容。\n\n### 创新解决方案：DiG-Flow 框架\n\nDiG-Flow 的核心思想是引入一个**基于最优传输理论的几何正则化信号**，通过衡量观察嵌入（observation embeddings）和动作嵌入（action embeddings）之间的**分布差异（Discrepancy）** 来指导模型训练和推理。\n\n#### 关键技术组件\n\n1.  **差异度量 (Discrepancy Function - `D`)**：\n    *   论文默认使用**切片Wasserstein距离 (Sliced Wasserstein Distance)** 来量化两个经验分布 `μ_H` (来自观察) 和 `μ_Z` (来自动作) 之间的运输成本。\n    *   **关键洞察**：低运输成本意味着观察和动作的表示在几何上是兼容的（aligned），表明语义连贯；高运输成本则暗示潜在的错位（misalignment），可能是由于模型学到了捷径或遇到了分布外的样本。\n\n2.  **单调门控映射 (Monotone Weight Mapping - `g = ϕ(D)`)**：\n    *   将计算出的差异 `D` 通过一个单调递减的函数（如 `g = max{g_min, exp(-τD)}`）映射为一个**门控权重 `g`**。\n    *   **作用**：当 `D` 很小时（对齐良好），`g` 接近1，表示这是一个高质量、可信的样本；当 `D` 很大时（错位严重），`g` 被压低（但不为零），表示这是一个可疑的样本。\n\n3.  **残差更新算子 (Residual Operator - `ℛ`)**：\n    *   这是一个轻量级的网络（如一个线性层），用于生成对原始观察特征 `H` 的调整方向。\n    *   最终的增强特征 `H̃` 通过以下方式计算：\n        ```math\n        \\tilde{H} = H + \\lambda \\cdot g \\cdot \\mathcal{R}(H)\n        ```\n    *   **关键设计**：这个更新是**门控的 (gated)**。只有当门控 `g` 较大时（即对齐良好），残差调整才会被充分应用。这确保了模型只在有信心的情况下才进行修正，避免了对噪声的过度反应。\n\n4.  **无侵入式集成 (Non-intrusive Integration)**：\n    -   **最大的优势之一**：DiG-Flow 在**表示层面**进行干预，它位于预训练的VLM骨干网络和流匹配动作头之间。\n    -   它**不修改**原有的流匹配路径、目标向量场或基础架构。这使得它可以像一个“即插即用”的模块（`DiG-Block`）无缝集成到现有的VLA模型中，计算开销极小。\n\n### 总结\n\n| 要点 | 内容 |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **核心问题** | VLA模型因依赖虚假相关性而导致在分布偏移和长程任务中鲁棒性差。 |\n| **核心创新** | 提出 **DiG-Flow**，利用观察-动作嵌入间的**分布差异**作为几何信号，实现**差异引导**的训练。 |\n| **关键技术** | 1. **差异度量** (Wasserstein距离)<br>2. **门控映射** (将差异转为置信权重)<br>3. **门控残差更新** (动态调整观察特征) |\n| **独特优势** | **无侵入式**：仅在表示层操作，不改变原有流匹配流程，可轻松集成。 |\n| **实际价值** | 显著提升模型在复杂、真实世界场景下的**鲁棒性和泛化能力**，尤其在数据有限时效果更佳。 |\n\n简而言之，DiG-Flow 通过一个巧妙的、基于最优传输的“健康检查”机制，让模型学会判断自己的“观察-动作”配对是否合理，并据此动态地、有选择地优化自身的内部表示，从而构建出更稳健、更可靠的机器人策略。",

DiG-Refine (推理时精炼)\n\n这是一个可选的后处理步骤，用于在推理时进一步提升动作质量。\n\n- **工作流程 (Algorithm 2)**:\n    1.  生成初始动作 $a^{(0)}$。\n    2.  将 $a^{(0)}$ 编码回嵌入空间得到 $Z^{(0)}$。\n    3.  重新计算当前预测的差异 $D^{(0)}$ 和门控 $g^{(0)}$。\n    4.  使用新的 $g^{(0)}$ 生成增强特征 $\\tilde{H}^{(0",

            "answer": "## 论文的主要局限性与未来改进方向\n\n根据论文第7节“Conclusions and Limitations”的内容，**DiG-Flow** 框架虽然在性能和鲁棒性上取得了显著提升，但仍存在以下几点主要局限性，并对应着明确的未来研究方向：\n\n### 主要局限性 (Limitations)\n\n1.  **对特征范数有隐含假设 (Assumption on Bounded Feature Norms):**\n    *   **问题描述：** 理论分析（如定理证明）依赖于一个关键假设，即观察特征 `H` 的范数是有界的（例如，`‖H‖_F ≤ R`）。这在使用了归一化机制的模型中是合理的，但对于那些不强制执行此约束的架构，该假设可能不成立。\n    *   **潜在影响：** 如果特征范数过大或不稳定，可能会破坏理论保证的有效性，甚至导致训练不稳定。\n\n2.  **批量统计的敏感性 (Sensitivity to Batch-level Statistics):**\n    *   **问题描述：** 当前的传输距离计算依赖于一个批次（mini-batch）内的统计数据。这意味着门控信号 `g` 可能会受到批次内样本组成的影响，例如被离群值（outliers）或小批量大小所干扰。\n    *   **潜在影响：** 这可能导致门控信号不够稳定或可靠，尤其是在数据分布复杂或批量较小时。\n\n3.  **依赖监督学习中的真实动作 (Dependence on Ground-truth Actions in Supervised Learning):**\n    *   **问题描述：** 在当前的监督学习框架下，`DiG-Flow` 需要使用数据集中的真实动作（ground-truth actions）来计算有意义的观察-动作差异。这限制了其在自监督学习（self-supervised learning）或强化学习（reinforcement learning, RL）等场景下的直接应用。\n    *   **潜在影响：** 无法利用 `DiG-Flow` 的几何正则化思想来解决RL中常见的稀疏奖励、探索效率等问题。\n\n### 未来可能的改进方向 (Future Research Directions)\n\n针对上述局限性，论文明确指出了几个富有潜力的未来研究方向：\n\n1.  **增强数值稳定性与泛化性：**\n    *   **探索替代方案：** 设计更鲁棒的差异度量方法，减少对单个批次的依赖。\n    *   **引入运行时统计 (Running Statistics)：** 使用滑动窗口平均等方式维护长期的特征分布统计信息，使门控信号更加平滑和稳定。\n    *   **开发实例级变体 (Instance-wise Variants)：** 探索完全基于单个样本内部信息进行差异计算的方法，从根本上避免批次效应。\n\n2.  **扩展到非监督/强化学习范式：**\n    *   **寻找替代的对齐信号：** 将 `DiG-Flow` 的核心思想——通过几何信号引导学习——迁移到无监督或强化学习领域。\n    *   **可能的信号来源：**\n        ```markdown\n        - **一致性信号 (Consistency Signals):** 利用同一状态在不同视角或数据增强下的预测一致性。\n        - **价值/优势函数加权 (Value/Advantage-based Weighting):** 使用估计的价值（value）或优势（advantage）作为权重，类似于 `g` 的作用，来强调高回报轨迹的表示学习。\n        - **内在动机 (Intrinsic Motivation):** 结合好奇心或探索奖励，为缺乏外部监督的场景提供对齐信号。\n        ```\n    *   **目标：** 实现无需真实动作标签的、同样具有鲁棒性的表示学习。\n\n3.  **优化计算效率：**\n    *   虽然论文提到开销“negligible”，但精确计算（如Wasserstein距离）仍有一定成本。未来可研究更高效的近似算法或硬件加速方案，以适应实时性要求极高的机器人控制任务。\n\n综上所述，`DiG-Flow` 的局限性主要集中在**理论假设的普适性**、**实现细节的鲁棒性**以及**应用场景的局限性**上。而未来的改进方向则聚焦于**放宽假设、增强鲁棒性**，并**将这一强大的几何正则化思想推广到更广泛的机器学习范式中**，尤其是自监督和强化学习领域。",
