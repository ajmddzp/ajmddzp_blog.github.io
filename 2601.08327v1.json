Each agent’s policy is trained with the Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm and employs a Graph Attention Network encoder that integrates simulated range-sensing data with communication embeddings exchanged among neighboring agents, enabling context-aware decision-making from both local sensing and relational information. In particular, this work introduces a unified framework that integrates graph-based communication and trajectory-aware safety through safety filters. The architecture is supported by a structured reward formulation designed to encourage effective target discovery and acquisition, collision avoidance, and de-correlation between the agents’ communication vectors by promoting informational orthogonality. The effectiveness of the proposed reward function is demonstrated through a comprehensive ablation study. Moreover, simulation results demonstrate safe, and stable task execution confirming the framework’s effectiveness.\nkeywords:\nCooperative target acquisition, Safe autonomous coordination, Decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning, Heterogeneous robotic systems, Learning-based control\n†\n†\nthanks:\nThis work was partially supported by the Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP) funded by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation.

UAVs provide wide-area perception and rapid mobility, while UGVs contribute endurance, payload capacity, and ground-level sensing. Coordinating such diverse platforms in complex and communication-constrained environments requires the autonomous agents to make decentralized decisions under partial observability and distinct motion dynamics. These challenges have motivated the growing use of distributed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to enable multi-robot cooperation in uncertain environments as analyzed by\nWang\net al.\n(\n2022\n)\n. Recent advances have demonstrated the feasibility of learning decentralized control policies that scale to large teams and complex tasks as per\nYu\net al.\n(\n2022\n); Kuba\net al.\n(\n2022\n); Jing\net al.\n(\n2025\n)\n. On-policy actor–critic methods such as the Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm have become strong baselines for cooperative tasks, while trust-region extensions, such as HAPPO and HATRPO derived from Heterogeneous-Agent Trust Region Learning (HATRL) proposed by\nZhong\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\n, improve training stability for heterogeneous agents. However, most of these frameworks ignore strong safety guarantees and inter-agent communication limitations, which restricts their deployment in physical robotic systems.\nIn parallel, graph-based neural architectures have emerged as an innate representation for relational reasoning and communication in multi-agent systems as presented by\nNiu\net al.\n(\n2021\n); Hu\net al.\n(\n2024\n); Liu\net al.\n(\n2023\n)\n. By modeling agents as nodes and their interactions as edges, such methods learn both who to communicate with and what to share. Despite their success, these approaches typically neglect the safety-critical aspects of real-world robotics. Recent advances in safe reinforcement learning have expanded both the theoretical and algorithmic foundations of constrained policy optimization and safe exploration\nGu\net al.\n(\n2024\n); Wachi\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\n. These works formalize diverse safety specifications, ranging from cost-based and probabilistic constraints to state-wise safety requirements, and analyze their implications for policy learning and constraint satisfaction. Even-then, integration with heterogeneous MARL and communication learning remains limited.\n1.1\nRelated works\nMulti-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has advanced cooperative control under uncertainty. In particular, the MAPPO framework investigated by\nYu\net al.\n(\n2022\n)\nshows that a simple actor–critic structure can yield robust policies with Centralized Training and Decentralized Execution (CTDE). Scalable MARL approaches aim to maintain learning efficiency and coordination as the number of agents grows. The work in\nCui\net al.\n(\n2025\n)\npresents an MADDPG-based UAV–USV collaborative decision-making method that enhances visual relative-position estimation via CNNs, introduces tailored multi-constraint reward functions for heterogeneous cooperation, and achieves faster convergence and superior performance compared to traditional strategies. In this context,\nZhang\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\nintroduces a scalable constrained policy optimization framework called Scalable MAPPO-Lagrangian (Scal-MAPPO-L), that enables safe and decentralized learning in large multi-agent systems by employing local\nκ\n\\kappa\n-hop policy updates, and thereby mitigating the exponential growth of the joint state–action space while preserving cooperative performance. The work in\nOkawa\net al.\n(\n2023\n)\nintroduces Information-sharing Constrained Policy Optimization (IsCPO), a MARL framework that sequentially updates agents’ policies with shared surrogate-cost and divergence information to guarantee constraint satisfaction during learning and achieve suboptimal yet safe multi-agent policies in large-scale control tasks.\nGuo\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\nfurther improves cooperative decision-making by using MAPPO-PIS, an intent-sharing–driven cooperative decision-making framework for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) that integrates Intention Generator Module (IGM) and the Safety Enhanced Module (SEM) correction to improve multi-agent policy learning, achieving superior safety, efficiency, and traffic performance in human–machine mixed merging scenarios. Although these frameworks are effective, many do not explicitly guarantee physical safety or enforce dynamic feasibility constraints. Our approach extends this foundation by incorporating safety filters for real-time, model-consistent safety within a MAPPO structure. Communication learning has emerged as a critical component of decentralized coordination. The Multi-Agent Graph-attentIon Communication (MAGIC) framework proposed by\nNiu\net al.\n(\n2021\n)\nemploys a graph-attention communication protocol by jointly learning a Scheduler that determines when agents communicate and whom they address through a differentiable, attention-based dynamic graph encoder, and a Message Processor that applies Graph Attention Networks (GATs) over these dynamic graphs, enabling fully end-to-end training of communication structure and content. The Deep Hierarchical Communication Graph (DHCG) analyzed by\nLiu\net al.\n(\n2023\n)\nlearns directed acyclic communication structures by optimizing graph topology end-to-end, enabling convergent and efficient information flow among agents.\nHu\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\nproposes CommFormer that reframes communication as a graph learning problem using transformer-based attention to infer sparse and adaptive communication topologies. Similarly, Agent Transformer Memory (ATM)\nYang\net al.\n(\n2022\n)\naddresses partial observability in multi-agent RL by using a transformer-based working-memory mechanism to integrate factored entity observations with temporal information and to encode entity-specific action semantics.\nSun\net al.\n(\n2025\n)\nformalized communication redundancy through a dimensional analysis of message embeddings and demonstrated that enforcing decorrelation within inter-agent representations significantly improves communication efficiency and cooperative performance in large-scale MARL systems. Comprehensive surveys\nGronauer and Diepold (\n2022\n); Huh and Mohapatra (\n2024\n)\nemphasize the importance of adaptive, efficient communication. Our framework introduces a communication dissimilarity regularization term in the reward function that explicitly penalizes correlated message vectors.\nThe work in\nFan\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\nintroduce an offline-compatible safe experience reshaping mechanism that learns underlying constraint geometry, projects unsafe actions onto its tangent safe space, and trains policies exclusively on these safety-corrected experiences. A pixel-observation safe RL algorithm that jointly learns a low-dimensional latent dynamics model and a latent barrier-like safety function to encode state-wise constraints with unknown hazard regions, enabling simultaneous safe policy optimization that significantly reduces safety violations and accelerates safety convergence while maintaining competitive reward performance is proposed in\nZhan\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\n. To address the lack of a unified, practical methodology in SafeRL, where agents must optimize performance while minimizing risks of unintended harm,\nJi\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\nintroduce a foundational, safety-centric framework that consolidates diverse RL algorithms into a cohesive, efficient research platform designed to streamline and accelerate progress in AI safety. Safe MARL frameworks\nGarg\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\nand constrained optimization approaches\nZhang\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\nhave begun exploring similar directions, but most remain centralized or homogeneous. Our work bridges this gap by embedding trajectory-aware safety filter for both holonomic (UAV) and differential-drive (UGV) agents directly into the decentralized MARL loop.\nFigure 1\n:\nIllustration of the VMAS environment in which three agents are trained to locate and acquire randomly placed targets (orange). The diagram highlights the key components of each agent’s policy, including the GNN encoder, MLP heads, and safety filters.\n1.2\nOur contribution\nTo address these challenges, this paper proposes a decentralized MARL framework for structurally heterogeneous agents, such as UAV–UGV teams, that combines graph-based communication, safety filters that evaluate the feasibility of the trajectory induced by each proposed action and rescale it in the event of a predicted collision, and stable on-policy learning. Moreover, a communication orthogonality regularization enforces representational dissimilarity among agents’ message embeddings, mitigating interference and redundancy in shared communication channels. In particular, the main contributions are:\n•\nA decentralized MARL architecture enabling coordination between structurally heterogeneous agents for collaborative target acquisition along with a communication orthogonality regularizer that promotes diverse messaging and robust multi-agent coordination.\n•\nA trajectory-based safety filter that enforces collision avoidance by predicting the state evolution induced by each proposed action and rescaling unsafe actions when a future violation is detected, ensuring that the executed control inputs remain within the admissible safe set.\n•\nComprehensive ablation studies that quantify the contributions of goal-reaching, safety enforcement, and communication diversity to overall task performance.\n2\nMethodology\nThis section introduces the reinforcement learning framework in\n2.1\n, the structure of the policy and critic networks in\n2.2\n, the proposed safety filters in\n2.3\nand the reward function formulation in\n2.4\n.\n2.1\nReinforcement learning framework\nThe partially-observable environment consists of a continuous 2D squared workspace of side length\nd\nd\nshown in Fig.\n1\nthat includes\nn\nt\nn_{t}\nrandomly distributed targets representing landmarks that\nn\nh\nn_{h}\nholonomic agents (UAVs) with radius\nr\nh\nr_{h}\nand\nn\nd\nn_{d}\ndifferential-drive agents (UGVs) with radius\nr\nd\nr_{d}\nhave to explore and reach to.\nWe denote by\nℋ\n=\n{\n1\n,\n…\n,\nn\nh\n}\n\\mathcal{H}=\\{1,\\ldots,n_{h}\\}\nand\n𝒟\n=\n{\nn\nh\n+\n1\n,\n…\n,\nn\nh\n+\nn\nd\n}\n\\mathcal{D}=\\{n_{h}+1,\\ldots,n_{h}+n_{d}\\}\nthe sets of holonomic and differential-drive agents, respectively.\nThe state of each agent\ni\ni\nis\n𝐱\ni\nt\n=\n{\n[\n𝐩\ni\nt\n,\n𝐯\ni\nt\n]\n⊤\n∈\nℝ\n4\n,\ni\n∈\nℋ\n,\n[\n𝐩\ni\nt\n,\nθ\ni\nt\n,\nv\ni\nt\n,\nω\ni\nt\n]\n⊤\n∈\nℝ\n5\n,\ni\n∈\n𝒟\n,\n\\mathbf{x}_{i}^{t}=\\begin{cases}\\big[\\mathbf{p}_{i}^{t},\\ \\mathbf{v}_{i}^{t}\\big]^{\\!\\top}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{4},&i\\in\\mathcal{H},\\\\\n\\big[\\mathbf{p}_{i}^{t},\\ \\theta_{i}^{t},\\ v_{i}^{t},\\ \\omega_{i}^{t}\\big]^{\\!\\top}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{5},&i\\in\\mathcal{D},\\end{cases}\n(1)\nwhere\n𝐩\ni\nt\n=\n[\nx\ni\nt\n,\ny\ni\nt\n]\n⊤\n\\mathbf{p}_{i}^{t}=[x_{i}^{t},y_{i}^{t}]^{\\!\\top}\nis the position,\n𝐯\ni\nt\n=\n[\nv\nx\n,\ni\nt\n,\nv\ny\n,\ni\nt\n]\n⊤\n\\mathbf{v}_{i}^{t}=[v_{x,i}^{t},v_{y,i}^{t}]^{\\!\\top}\nis the velocity (holonomic),\nθ\ni\nt\n\\theta_{i}^{t}\nis the heading,\nv\ni\nt\nv_{i}^{t}\nthe linear speed, and\nω\ni\nt\n\\omega_{i}^{t}\nthe angular speed of the agent\ni\ni\n.\nMoreover, all agents are equipped with a simulated range sensor based on ray casting, which provides\nn\nl\nn_{l}\nrange measurements indicating detected targets or the maximum sensing range, denoted\nr\nh\nl\nr_{h}^{l}\nfor holonomic agents and\nr\nd\nl\nr_{d}^{l}\nfor differential-drive agents.\nAt the beginning of each episode, the agents have no prior information about the environment or target locations.

Moreover, the training is performed using the BenchMARL framework proposed by\nBettini\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\n, leveraging its implementation of the Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm. In particular, MAPPO is an on-policy actor-critic method adhering to the centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm, whereby each agent learns an individual policy, while a shared centralized critic is optimized using joint observations to stabilize multi-agent learning.\nTable 1\n:\nKey environment and reward function parameters\nSymbol\nValue\nSymbol\nValue\nn\nd\n,\nn\nh\n,\nn\nt\n,\nd\nn_{d},n_{h},n_{t},d\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n,\n10\n​\nm\n1,2,3,10m\nw\ndist\nw_{\\text{dist}}\n1.0\n1.0\nr\nd\n,\nr\nh\n,\nv\nmax\nr_{d},r_{h},v_{\\max}\n0.5\n​\nm\n,\n0.5\n​\nm\n,\n10\n​\nm\n/\ns\n0.5m,0.5m,10m/s\nw\ngoal\nw_{\\text{goal}}\n1.0\n1.0\nn\nl\n,\nr\nd\nl\n,\nr\nh\nl\nn_{l},r^{l}_{d},r^{l}_{h}\n16\n,\n1.5\n​\nm\n,\n3.0\n​\nm\n16,1.5m,3.0m\nw\ncoll\nw_{\\text{coll}}\n1.0\n1.0\nd\nsafe\n,\nρ\ncov\nd_{\\text{safe}},\\rho_{\\text{cov}}\n0.05\n​\nm\n,\n1.5\n​\nm\n0.05m,1.5m\nw\ncomm\nw_{\\text{comm}}\n0.1\n0.1\nm\n,\nu\nmax\n,\nΔ\n​\nt\n,\nc\nd\nm,u_{\\max},\\Delta t,c_{d}\n1\n​\nk\n​\ng\n,\n1\n,\n0.1\n​\ns\n,\n0.25\n1kg,1,0.1s,0.25\nr\ngoal\nr_{\\text{goal}}\n10.0\n10.0\nd\nc\n,\nr\nc\nd_{c},r_{c}\n16\n,\n4.5\n​\nm\n16,4.5m\nr\ncoll\nr_{\\text{coll}}\n−\n8.0\n-8.0\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFigure 3\n:\n(a) Entropy evolution for holonomic and diff-drive agents under the four reward\nconfigurations.

Each subplot shows the mean discovery rate across simulations, with colored curves indicating the diff-drive agent (green), holonomic agent 1 (orange), and holonomic agent 2 (purple).\n3.2\nTraining results\nThe agent policies have been trained for 834 optimization steps in 600 parallel environments using MAPPO. Figure\n2(a)\nshows the\nevolution of the mean episode reward collected during training across the four reward configurations. Policies trained under R2 and R3 exhibit clear and\nstable convergence, following highly similar learning trajectories. In contrast, R1 remains close to zero throughout training, indicating that this reward\nconfiguration fails to provide a sufficiently informative learning signal. R4 achieves the highest episode rewards and shows evidence of convergence,\nalthough with noticeably higher variance. A similar behaviour is observed when analysing the mean episode reward per agent type, as shown in Figures\n2(b)\nand\n2(c)\n. For both R2 and R3, the differential-drive agent consistently achieves slightly higher rewards than the holonomic agents,\nwhereas under R4 the holonomic agents marginally outperform the differential-drive one. The close correspondence between the per-agent reward curves across all reward configurations suggests that the learned policies support effective collaborative task execution, without inducing a pronounced asymmetric\nworkload among the heterogeneous agents. Figure\n3(a)\nreports the entropy evolution of the learned policies, which provides insight into the exploration–exploitation dynamics during training. Under R2, R3, and R4, entropy decays rapidly, indicating that the agents progressively acquire stable and consistent behaviours. Notably, for\nR2 and R3 the holonomic agents retain higher entropy for longer than the differential-drive agent, suggesting a degree of behavioural specialization.\nConversely, R4 yields nearly identical entropy profiles across agent types, indicating more symmetric role emergence. In contrast, R1 maintains high\nentropy throughout training, reflecting persistent policy randomness and the absence of meaningful behavioural convergence.\n3.3\nSimulation results\nThe trained policies have been further evaluated on 200 simulated environments,\neach executed for 100 timesteps, using scenarios consistent with those employed\nduring training. Figure\n3(b)\nreports the mean number of\ntargets acquired over time and provides an overall indication of task\nexecution efficiency. Policies trained with R1 exhibit minimal progress,\nconfirming their inability to explore the environment effectively and to\nlocate targets. In contrast, the policies trained with R2, R3, and R4\nsuccessfully acquire targets within the available time horizon. The steep\ninitial increase observed for the latter configurations indicates that the\nagents have learned meaningful acquisition behaviours. However, the\nconsiderable variance associated with R2 and R3 suggests reduced robustness\nand a stronger dependence on the specific simulation instance. These observations are corroborated in\nFigure\n3(c)\n, which shows the probability mass function of\nthe number of targets acquired at the final timestep. Policies obtained with R2,\nR3, and R4 typically manage to acquire one or two targets, whereas R1 fails to\nachieve comparable performance in most evaluation runs. To assess the distribution of workload across the heterogeneous agents, Figure\n4\npresents the per-agent target discovery dynamics.\nR4 yields policies in which the discovery trajectories of the diff-drive and\nholonomic agents are closely aligned, indicating a more balanced workload and\nthus more symmetric collaboration. Conversely, R2 and R3 lead to more\npronounced discrepancies between agents, revealing a degree of specialization\nand a less uniform allocation of the acquisition effort. Among these,\nR3 exhibits more stable behaviour than R2, as reflected by the lower variance\nin entropy during training and by the clearer role differentiation observed for\nthe two holonomic agents relative to the diff-drive agent. Across all evaluation metrics, policies trained under R1 demonstrate markedly\ninferior performance. They fail to develop reliable exploration or acquisition\nstrategies and consistently underperform relative to the other reward\nconfigurations.\n4\nConclusion\nThis work presents a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for heterogeneous robotic teams for target acquisition in unknown environments, combining graph-based policies with safety filters to ensure collision-free coordination. The simulation results demonstrated stable learning, effective cooperation, and balanced workload distribution across agents under suitable reward shaping. Moreover, ablation studies confirmed the importance of goal-oriented, collision-avoidance, and communication-related reward terms. Future work will improve the performances in the target acquisition, investigate the efficacy of the framework with larger teams, and real-world deployment of the learned policies.\n{ack}\nThe computations were enabled by resources provided by the National Academic Infrastructure for Supercomputing in Sweden (NAISS) and Chalmers e-Science Centre at C3SE, partially funded by the Swedish Research Council through grant agreement no. 2022-06725.

Each agent's policy is trained with the Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm and employs a Graph Attention Network encoder that integrates simulated range-sensing data with communication embeddings exchanged among neighboring agents, enabling context-aware decision-making from both local sensing and relational information. In particular, this work introduces a unified framework that integrates graph-based communication and trajectory-aware safety through safety filters. The architecture is supported by a structured reward formulation designed to encourage effective target discovery and acquisition, collision avoidance, and de-correlation between the agents' communication vectors by promoting informational orthogonality. The effectiveness of the proposed reward function is demonstrated through a comprehensive ablation study.

            "answer": "## 论文发展脉络梳理\n\n本文《Safe Heterogeneous Multi-Agent RL with Communication Regularization for Coordinated Target Acquisition》是**异构多智能体强化学习（MARL）**领域，特别是面向**安全协同目标获取**任务的最新研究成果。其发展脉络可以梳理为几个关键方向，每一步都在解决前作的局限性。\n\n### 1. 核心问题演进：从同质协调到异构安全协同\n早期的MARL研究（如Yu et al., 2022的MAPPO）主要关注**同质智能体**在完全可观测或简单通信下的合作，**忽视了智能体结构差异（如UAV/UGV动力学不同）和硬性安全约束**。本文的“前作”脉络正是围绕解决这两个核心挑战展开。\n\n### 2. 主要发展方向及改进\n\n#### 发展方向一：**处理异构性与可扩展性**\n*   **早期工作 (如 Yu et al., 2022; Kuba et al., 2022)**：提出了MAPPO、HAPPO等算法，奠定了CTDE（集中训练分散执行）范式，证明了在复杂任务中学习分散策略的可行性，但主要针对同质或简单异构智能体。\n*   **改进工作 (如 Zhong et al., 2024)**：提出了**HATRL（异构智能体信任域学习）**，专门针对异构智能体优化策略更新，提高了训练稳定性。这是对同质算法框架的重要泛化。\n*   **本文的改进**：\n    *   **统一框架**：明确将**运动学截然不同的智能体（全向移动的UAV和差速驱动的UGV）** 纳入同一学习框架，其策略网络共享编码器但拥有**独立的条件策略头**，以适配不同的动作空间。\n    *   **可扩展通信**：采用基于**图注意力网络（GAT）** 的编码器，根据智能体间距离动态构建通信图，使框架能适应团队规模的变化，这是对固定通信拓扑或完全连接通信的改进。\n\n#### 发展方向二：**集成安全保证**\n*   **早期MARL工作**：大多专注于任务性能（如奖励最大化），**缺乏对碰撞等安全约束的显式、可证明的保证**，限制了在物理机器人中的部署。\n*   **并行安全RL进展 (如 Gu et al., 2024; Wachi et al., 2024)**：在单智能体领域建立了约束策略优化的理论基础，但未与多智能体、特别是异构多智能体场景深度结合。\n*   **近期安全MARL探索 (如 Zhang et al., 2024的Scal-MAPPO-L; Okawa et al., 2023的IsCPO)**：开始将拉格朗日乘子法等约束优化方法引入MARL，提供了策略层面的安全约束。但这类方法通常在**学习过程中**通过惩罚来满足约束，不保证**执行时**每一时刻的绝对安全。\n*   **本文的改进**：\n    *   **引入轨迹感知安全滤波器**：这是关键创新。它在**策略网络输出动作后、环境执行前**介入，对提议的动作进行前向模拟，预测短期轨迹，并**实时缩放不安全动作**。这提供了**低层级、模型辅助的即时安全保证**，与基于学习/惩罚的高层约束形成互补。\n    *   **异构安全建模**：滤波器针对UAV（使用矩形可达集）和UGV（使用圆形保守近似）的不同动力学模型分别设计，实现了**对异构平台的安全统一管理**。\n\n#### 发展方向三：**优化通信效率与有效性**\n*   **早期通信学习**：智能体通常广播原始或简单编码的信息，导致信道冗余和干扰。\n*   **图通信学习 (如 Niu et al., 2021的MAGIC; Liu et al., 2023的DHCG)**：利用图神经网络学习“与谁通信”和“通信什么”，实现了自适应、高效的通信拓扑。\n*   **通信去冗余研究 (如 Sun et al., 2025)**：从理论上分析了通信嵌入的冗余问题，并提出通过去相关提升效率。\n*   **本文的改进**：\n    *   **提出通信正交性正则化**：将其作为**奖励函数的一部分**（`r_i^comm`），直接惩罚智能体间通信向量的高相关性（通过余弦相似度平方）。这鼓励智能体产生**信息互补**的消息，减少了信道中的冗余信息，从**学习目标层面**促进了高效协作，是对单纯改进通信架构的补充。\n\n#### 发展方向四：**设计结构化奖励函数**\n*   **常见做法**：使用稀疏的最终任务奖励或简单的稠密奖励（如距离减少），学习信号弱，收敛慢。\n*   **近期进展 (如 Cui et al., 2025)**：为目标驱动的异构协同任务设计多约束奖励函数，加速收敛。\n*   **本文的改进**：\n    *   **系统化奖励消融研究**：明确将奖励分解为**距离奖励、目标达成奖励、碰撞惩罚、通信多样性奖励**四个组件，并通过渐进式实验（R1->R4）量化了每个组件对最终性能（学习稳定性、目标获取效率、工作量平衡）的贡献。这为复杂MARL任务的奖励工程提供了可解释的范例。\n\n### 总结脉络图\n```\n同质MARL (如MAPPO)\n        ↓ (解决异构性)\n异构MARL算法 (如HATRL)\n        ↓ (集成安全保证)\n安全MARL/约束优化 (如Scal-MAPPO-L)\n        ↓ (优化通信)\n图通信与去冗余学习 (如MAGIC, Sun et al.)\n        |\n        | (本文工作：统一与集成)\n        ↓\n**Safe Heterogeneous MARL with Communication Regularization**\n**核心整合与创新**：\n1. **异构统一**：在统一框架下处理UAV/UGV。\n2. **安全升级**：引入**实时轨迹安全滤波器**，提供执行时保证。\n3. **通信优化**：在奖励中增加**正交性正则化**，促进信息高效。\n4. **奖励可解释**：通过**系统消融**验证各奖励组件价值。\n```\n\n**实际价值**：本文推动MARL向**更贴近实际机器人应用**的方向迈进了一大步，通过整合**异构模型、实时安全保证、高效通信**三大关键要素，为未来在搜索救援、协同勘探等真实场景中部署可靠的异构机器人团队提供了重要的算法框架和设计思路。",

(2021) - MAGIC** | **基于图注意力的通信** | 使用图注意力网络（GAT）学习何时通信、与谁通信以及处理消息，实现通信结构和内容的端到端训练。 | **区别与改进**：1. **安全性集成**：MAGIC专注于通信学习，未考虑安全。本文在GAT编码器的基础上，**增加了轨迹感知的安全过滤器**，确保动作的物理安全性。2. **通信效率**：本文额外引入了**通信正交性正则化**到奖励函数中，明确惩罚消息向量的相关性，以减少冗余，而MAGIC未显式优化此点。 |\n| **Cui et al.

(2024) - Scal-MAPPO-L** | **可扩展的约束策略优化** | 通过局部κ-hop策略更新实现大规模多智能体系统的安全分散学习，缓解联合状态-动作空间的指数增长。 | **区别与改进**：1. **安全实现方式**：Scal-MAPPO-L在**策略优化层面**通过拉格朗日方法处理约束。本文则采用**分层架构**：策略网络输出名义动作，由**独立的安全过滤器**在执行前进行投影和修正。2. **异构性**：本文明确处理**结构异构**（UAV/UGV动力学不同）的智能体，并为其设计了**各自对应的安全过滤器**（分别处理完整驱动和差速驱动模型）。 |\n| **Guo et al. (2024) - MAPPO-PIS** | **意图共享驱动的协同决策** | 为网联自动驾驶车辆(CAV)引入意图生成模块和安全增强模块，提升混合交通场景下的安全性、效率和交通性能。 | **区别与改进**：1. **应用领域与智能体类型**：MAPPO-PIS针对**CAV**（同构或近似同构）。本文针对**异构机器人团队**（UAV/UGV），其动力学差异更大。2. **安全模块集成度**：两者都包含安全模块，但本文的**安全过滤器是“轨迹感知”**的，它预测动作引发的未来状态并直接修正控制输入，与动力学模型紧密结合。 |\n| **Sun et al. (2025)** | **通信冗余的维度分析** | 通过对消息嵌入的维度分析形式化通信冗余，证明强制智能体间表示去相关能显著提高大规模MARL中的通信效率和协同性能。 | **区别与改进**：本文吸收了其核心思想，但**实现方式不同**。Sun等人可能从理论或架构层面分析。本文则提出一种**实用的、基于奖励的工程化方法**：将通信向量的余弦相似度惩罚项（`r_i^comm`）直接纳入奖励函数，在训练中鼓励信息正交性。 |\n\n### 总结：本文的核心创新与改进\n\n相较于上述“前作”（即领域现有工作），本文的主要改善体现在 **“统一”** 和 **“深化”** ：\n\n1.  **统一安全与学习**：构建了一个**将分散式MARL（MAPPO）、图注意力通信（GAT）和实时安全控制（Safety Filter）** 三者紧密结合的框架。多数前作只侧重其中一或两个方面。\n2.  **深化异构性处理**：不仅智能体类型异构（UAV/UGV），还为其**分别定制了符合各自动力学模型（完整驱动 vs 差速驱动）的安全过滤器**，这是对通用安全MARL方法的重要细化。\n3.  **创新通信优化手段**：提出了**通信正交性正则化奖励项**，这是一种简单有效、易于在现有MARL训练流程中实施的通信去冗余方法，直接优化了通信内容的有效性。\n4.  **全面的实证分析**：通过系统的**消融实验（R1-R4）**，定量分析了目标探索、安全约束、通信多样性等奖励成分对最终任务性能（如目标获取效率、工作量平衡、学习稳定性）的具体贡献，为奖励函数设计提供了实证依据。\n\n**总而言之，本文并非对作者自身前作的迭代，而是在综合现有领域最佳实践（MAPPO, GAT通信）的基础上，针对异构多机器人系统在物理部署中的关键挑战（安全性、通信效率），提出了一个创新且实用的集成解决方案，并通过严谨的实验验证了其有效性。**",
