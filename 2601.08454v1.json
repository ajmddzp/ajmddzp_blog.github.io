Digital twins enable the safe testing of control policies, the study of contact-rich interactions, and the development of reinforcement learning strategies prior to real-world deployment\n[\n15\n]\n. Constructing high-fidelity simulations (e.g., in MuJoCo\n[\n18\n]\n), however, requires precise knowledge of object properties such as mass, center of mass, surface friction, and geometric dimensions. These quantities are often unknown\na priori\nand cannot be reliably inferred from visual observations alone\n[\n13\n]\n.\nExisting real-to-simulation (real2sim) pipelines for physical parameter estimation typically rely on labour-intensive manual measurements or on automated but rigid, pre-programmed interaction routines. While effective in controlled settings, such pipelines are not robust to novel objects, varying task requirements, or unstructured scenes. In particular, they generally estimate a fixed and often exhaustive set of physical parameters, regardless of whether all parameters are required for the downstream simulation objective. As a result, unnecessary interactions are performed, and task relevance is not explicitly considered. Recent work has demonstrated the feasibility of estimating physical parameters through robotic interaction\n[\n14\n,\n5\n]\n. Nevertheless, these approaches assume fixed exploration strategies and do not reason over user intent, semantic scene context, or parameter relevance when deciding\nwhich\nproperties to measure and\nhow\nto acquire them autonomously.\nIn parallel, vision-language models (VLMs) and vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown promising capabilities in grounding high-level natural-language instructions into robot-executable actions\n[\n9\n,\n4\n]\n. However, most existing systems produce unstructured action sequences or give single pose commands, offering limited support for explicit task logic, safety constraints, or reactive decision-making during contact-rich interaction. Behavior Trees (BTs) provide a complementary formalism for structuring robotic behavior in a modular, interpretable, and reactive manner\n[\n3\n]\n. Recent studies have explored the use of large language models and VLMs to generate BTs from natural language\n[\n12\n,\n20\n]\n, but have not addressed the problem of autonomously selecting and sequencing physical interaction primitives for active perception, real2sim parameter acquisition.\nIn this work, we propose an autonomous active perception real2sim framework (Fig.\n1\n) that combines multi-modal scene understanding, VLM-based reasoning, and behavior-tree automated generation to construct simulation-ready models in an intent-driven manner. Given a high-level user request, a description of the incomplete simulation, and an RGB observation of the scene, the system identifies relevant objects, infers the minimal set of physical parameters required to complete the simulation, and generates an executable BT that specifies a conditioned sequence of exploratory interactions. The robot executes the BT to acquire the required properties through contact-based probing, lifting, pushing, and gripper-based measurements. The estimated parameters are then used to instantiate a physics-aware simulation in MuJoCo\n[\n18\n]\n.\nThe contributions of this work are twofold:\n•\nActive perception, intent-driven real2sim pipeline.\nWe introduce a real2sim framework that conditions autonomous physical parameter acquisition on user intent, enabling automatic and selective estimation of only the parameters required by the target simulation task. We present a VLM-powered method for generating executable BTs from natural language and visual context, enabling interpretable and reactive interaction strategies for parameter acquisition without requiring robotics expertise from the user.\n•\nBehavior Tree planning with atomic, physically grounded actions\n. Unlike prior VLM/LLM-based BT generation approaches that rely on high-level manipulation skills (e.g.,\nPickUp\nor\nThrowAway\n[\n20\n]\n), our framework plans directly over a fixed set of low-level, elementary actions (e.g., gripper commands, Cartesian motions, and sensing primitives), enabling fine-grained control, contact-aware interaction, and direct integration of physical measurements into Real2Sim pipelines.\nWe validate the proposed framework on a torque-controlled robot, demonstrating autonomous estimation of object mass, friction-related quantities, and surface height in real-world tabletop scenarios.\nExperimental results across multiple scenarios involving unknown objects, occlusions, and varying user requests demonstrate that the proposed framework enables flexible, interpretable, and task-aware simulation construction. By explicitly coupling high-level reasoning with physically grounded robotic interaction, this work advances toward scalable and autonomous real2sim pipelines for complex real-world environments.\nII\nRelated Works\nII-A\nReal2Sim and Physical Parameter Estimation for Simulation Construction\nAutonomous simulation constructions aim to create high-fidelity virtual replicas of real environments to support simulation-based planning, control, and learning\n[\n17\n]\n. In robotics, digital twins have been applied to predictive maintenance, simulation-based validation, and reinforcement learning under realistic dynamics. Bridging the gap between physical systems and their simulated counterparts has therefore motivated extensive research in real2sim methodologies.\nReal2sim approaches relied on carefully controlled laboratory setups to estimate object properties such as mass, inertia, and geometry through robotic interaction. Authors in\n[\n14\n]\nintroduced a scalable pick-and-place pipeline that estimates object geometry and inertial properties using joint-torque measurements collected during structured manipulation routines. Differentiable physics has also been employed to optimize physical parameters directly from observed trajectories, enabling closed-loop real2sim refinement\n[\n5\n]\n.\nAlthough effective in controlled settings, these methods use rigid, pre-defined exploration and fixed parameter estimation. They lack adaptation to user goals, object semantics, and scene context, estimate unnecessary physical properties, and rarely leverage semantic reasoning to guide what to estimate or how to interact. This prevents parameter acquisition in unstructured environments and task-specific scenarios, highlighting the need for approaches that integrate user intent, semantic understanding, and autonomous interaction planning.\nII-B\nGenerative AI for 3D World Model Construction\nRecent research has explored generative and automated pipelines for constructing 3D world models, addressing limitations of traditional manual modeling and enabling simulation-ready environments. For example,\n[\n10\n]\nproposes an agentic language–vision framework that integrates LLM planning with vision-guided refinement to generate physically plausible, interactive 3D scenes from text prompts, improving layout realism and spatial coherence. Similarly,\n[\n11\n]\nintroduces structured spatial context—comprising semantic blueprints, semantically labeled point clouds, and scene hypergraphs—allowing VLMs to iteratively generate and edit coherent 3D environments for downstream spatial tasks such as interactive editing and path planning. Other systems, such as\n[\n21\n]\n, provide scalable generative engines for creating photorealistic and physics-aware 3D assets that can be directly imported into simulators for embodied intelligence research. These works illustrate emerging trends in automated 3D world model construction with generative AI and multimodal reasoning for robotics and embodied AI.\nWhile these approaches advance automated 3D scene generation and graphical realism, they largely ignore the estimation of underlying physical parameters, such as object mass or friction, focusing primarily on visual appearance rather than simulation fidelity. This limitation constrains their direct applicability to real2sim pipelines or contact-rich robotic interaction tasks.\nII-C\nBehavior Trees for Robotic Task Execution and LLM/VLM-Based Generation\nVision-Language Models (VLMs) enable grounding of natural-language instructions in visual observations, supporting multi-step reasoning and general-purpose manipulation planning. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models\n[\n16\n]\n, including OpenVLA\n[\n9\n]\n, PaLM-E\n[\n4\n]\n, and RT-2\n[\n2\n]\n, extend this capability by directly mapping multi-modal inputs to action proposals or motion primitives, demonstrating strong cross-task and cross-platform generalization.\nBehavior Trees (BTs) provide a modular and compositional formalism for structuring robotic behavior, enabling reactive, hierarchical, and interpretable task execution\n[\n3\n,\n7\n]\n. Due to these properties, BTs have been widely adopted in robotic manipulation, assembly, and exploration tasks, offering improved robustness and transparency compared to finite-state machines or monolithic policies.\nRecent work has investigated the use of large language models and VLMs to generate BTs from natural language descriptions or contextual inputs\n[\n20\n,\n12\n]\n. However, existing approaches primarily focus on task execution and assume predefined, high-level action nodes with fixed semantics. They do not address the problem of autonomously selecting, composing, and sequencing elementary physical interaction primitives for adaptive environment exploration. Furthermore, the application of LLM/VLM-generated BTs to real2sim parameter acquisition and digital twin construction remains largely unexplored. Related approaches integrate VLMs and reactive planners with BTs for real-time failure detection and correction, highlighting the benefits of structured hierarchical planning for robust robotics execution\n[\n1\n]\n.\nIn contrast to prior VLM-based BT generation approaches that assume pre-defined high-level actions such as\nPickUp\nor\nThrowAway\n[\n20\n]\n, our framework plans directly over a set of atomic motion and sensing primitives, enabling physically grounded interaction and parameter estimation.\nIII\nProblem Formulation and Solution\nOur framework constructs a simulation-ready model by autonomously combining human intent, multi-modal scene understanding, behavior-tree-guided robotic exploration, and physics-based parameter estimation. The overall pipeline transforms a high-level user request into a sequence of targeted interaction behaviors that acquire the physical parameters required for simulation, estimating missing parameters only. Notably, the same system prompt is reused unchanged across all experimental scenarios in Sec\nV\n, demonstrating that task adaptation emerges from multi-modal reasoning rather than from manual tuning.\nThis section introduces the overall methodology of the proposed framework. In Sec.\nIII-A\nwe formalize the problem and define the required abstractions; Sec.\nIII-B\nformalizes the BT generation; Sec.\nIII-C\npresents the Prompt in each part and user inputs; and Sec.\nIII-D\ndetails the control of the robot and data acquisition in the real environment, during the exploration phase.\nIII-A\nProblem Formulation\nWe consider a real-world scene containing one or more objects with partially unknown physical properties. A human operator provides an incomplete simulation description\n𝒟\n\\mathcal{D}\nwith some missing parameters (e.g.,\n.xml\nfile in MuJoCo\n[\n18\n]\n) and/or a high-level request\nℛ\n\\mathcal{R}\n(e.g.,\n“Create a simulation of the table with the bottle visible in the camera”\n), which specifies the intended simulation goal rather than the required measurements. The user is considered to be agnostic to robotics, BTs, and VLMs.\nGiven\nℛ\n\\mathcal{R}\n,\n𝒟\n\\mathcal{D}\n, and an RGB image\nℐ\n\\mathcal{I}\nof the scene, the model determines the set of physical parameters that have to be estimated to complete the simulation and autonomously plan the necessary interactions to obtain them.\nThe objective is to construct a simulation model\n𝒯\n\\mathcal{T}\n:\n𝒯\n=\n{\n𝒟\n,\nℛ\n,\n𝒢\n,\n𝒫\n}\n,\n\\mathcal{T}=\\{\\mathcal{D},\\mathcal{R},\\mathcal{G},\\mathcal{P}\\},\nwhere\n𝒢\n\\mathcal{G}\ndenotes the object geometries (meshes, collision shapes, RGB rendering…), and\n𝒫\n\\mathcal{P}\ndenotes the physical parameters:\n𝒫\n=\n{\nmass\n,\ndimensions\n,\nfriction\n}\n\\mathcal{P}=\\{\\text{mass},\\text{dimensions},\\text{friction}\\}\n.\nUnlike traditional real2sim approaches that rely on predefined exploration routines (Sec.\nII-A\n), our system\nautomatically generates\nthe interaction strategy needed to infer the relevant subset of\n𝒫\n\\mathcal{P}\n, conditioned on the user’s simulation goal. This enables task-aware, minimal, and adaptive parameter acquisition.\nWe assume a static workspace during execution, a single robot entity acting in the static scene, object poses\np\ni\np_{i}\nare available as metadata at planning time, and a predefined library of reliable atomic actions\n𝒜\n\\mathcal{A}\nthat the robot can execute. The object poses are assumed to be available as the focus is on autonomous selection and acquisition of physical parameters rather than on visual perception itself.\nIII-B\nMulti-Modal Scene Understanding and Plan Generation\nThe first stage processes\n𝒮\n​\n(\n𝒟\n,\nℛ\n,\nℐ\n)\n\\mathcal{S}(\\mathcal{D},\\mathcal{R},\\mathcal{I})\nusing a vision-language model (VLM).\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\nis the system prompt (Sec.\nIII-C\n) tailored for physical parameter estimation that embeds variables\n𝒟\n,\nℛ\n,\nℐ\n\\mathcal{D},\\mathcal{R},\\mathcal{I}\nin the fixed and priorly engineered part (see Sec.\nIII-C\n1\n).\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\nis fixed before task execution by an expert, then an agnostic user can perform parameter estimations automatically, only providing variables triplet and without knowing\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\n.\nThe VLM autonomously grounds linguistic descriptors in the visual scene and produces a structured interpretation consisting of:\n1.\nObject Identification.\nThe VLM detects scene objects referenced in the simulation (e.g., “bottle”, “table”) and associates them with provided 3D locations. This step establishes the set of\nn\nn\ncandidate objects for parameter estimation\n𝒪\n=\n{\n(\no\n1\n,\np\n1\n)\n,\n…\n​\n(\no\nn\n,\np\nn\n)\n}\n\\mathcal{O}=\\{(o_{1},p_{1}),\\dots(o_{n},p_{n})\\}\nwhere\no\ni\no_{i}\nis the detected object with the provided pose\np\ni\np_{i}\n. As an assumption, pose\np\ni\np_{i}\nis always available as environmental metadata.\n2.\nParameter Discovery.\nFrom the semantics of\nℛ\n\\mathcal{R}\nand analysis of\n𝒟\n\\mathcal{D}\n, the VLM infers\nwhich physical parameters are necessary\n.\nFor example, a request involving manipulation requires object mass, while a placement task requires table height and object dimensions.\nΦ\n=\n{\nϕ\n1\n,\n…\n,\nϕ\nm\n}\n\\Phi=\\{\\phi_{1},\\dots,\\phi_{m}\\}\nis the set of\nm\nm\nmissing physical parameters inferred as necessary for the user request,\nwhere\nϕ\nj\n∈\n𝒫\n\\phi_{j}\\in\\mathcal{P}\n.\nFormally, the VLM produces a set\nΦ\n⊆\n𝒫\n,\n\\Phi\\subseteq\\mathcal{P},\nwhere\nΦ\n\\Phi\nis the minimal set of parameters needed to satisfy the simulation goal.\n3.\nExploration Action Inference.\nThe VLM maps each missing parameter in\nΦ\n\\Phi\nto one or more atomic actions from the predefined library\n𝒜\n\\mathcal{A}\nshown in Tab.\nI\n. Each action consists of an elementary operation that the robot can perform (e.g., open the gripper or reach a target joint configuration) or an elementary data acquisition (e.g,. read forces and torques vector applied on the end effector). The\n𝒜\n\\mathcal{A}\nset is defined before the execution of the tasks, and each atomic action needs to be engineered. With this set, the model can build as many complex interactions with the environment as the combinations of atomic actions are. All atomic actions, including sensing operations, are represented as leaf nodes in the BT.\nTherefore, the VLM processes the input triplet\n(\n𝒟\n,\nℛ\n,\nℐ\n)\n(\\mathcal{D},\\mathcal{R},\\mathcal{I})\nand autonomously produces a structured output BT. This is a hierarchical list specifying the abstract interaction plan.\nIt is of the form:\nℬ\n​\n𝒯\n​\n(\n𝒜\n,\n𝒞\n)\n=\nV\n​\nL\n​\nM\n​\n(\n𝒮\n,\n𝒟\n,\nℛ\n,\nℐ\n)\n=\n(\n[\nnode\n1\n,\nnode\n2\n,\n…\n]\n)\n\\mathcal{BT}(\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{C})=VLM(\\mathcal{S},\\mathcal{D,R,I})=([\\,\\textsf{node}_{1},\\textsf{node}_{2},\\dots\\,])\nwhere each node contains:\nnode\ni\n=\n(\nargs\n,\ntype\n)\n,\n\\textsf{node}_{i}=\\big(\\textsf{args},\\textsf{type}\\big),\nwith\nargs\ninputs of the nodes as showed in Tab.\nI\nand\ntype\n∈\n{\n𝒞\n,\n𝒜\n}\n\\in\\{\\mathcal{C},\\mathcal{A}\\}\n, where\n𝒞\n\\mathcal{C}\nis the set of composites types for Behavior Trees. Composite behaviors manage children and apply some logic to the way they execute and return a result. They do not directly execute any kind of action.\nThis structured output allows deterministic usage of BT libraries and ensures interpretability and reproducibility.\nTo convert the VLM’s abstract plan into a structured and executable policy, we chose BTs for their compositionality, reactivity, and interoperability.\nBTs provide strong reactive execution properties due to their tick-based evaluation. At each control cycle\nt\nt\n, the root node is ticked, and control flows recursively through the children. This ensures immediate response to sensor feedback if an action fails, non-blocking parallel execution, and a composable structure by adding or removing subtrees, which does not affect the behavior of unrelated branches since each node explicitly encodes success/failure conditions. These properties make BTs particularly suitable for contact-rich parameter estimation tasks, where rapid adaptation to physical feedback is required.\nThe resulting BT encodes a structured exploration policy that is reactive to sensor feedback in real-time, interpretable by human operators, and generalizable across tasks without retraining.\nAlong with the BT, we opted to let the model output an explanation text\nℰ\n\\mathcal{E}\nexplaining the exploration strategy. Furthermore, in the system prompt, it is specified in the behaviors section of\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\nthat: if the task can not be completed, the model has to explain why and, in case it is possible, complete with the given actions enough measurements with which the user can reconstruct the wanted parameter.\nIII-C\nPrompt composition\nThe prompt is fed to the VLM as input and can be divided into four main parts: system prompt\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\n, simulation description\n𝒟\n\\mathcal{D}\n, user prompt\nℛ\n\\mathcal{R}\n, and image\nℐ\n\\mathcal{I}\n.\nIII-C\n1\nSystem Prompt\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\nThe fixed part of the prompt is called the system prompt. It gives the model all the necessary information and instructions, of which the final user is assumed to be agnostic, and which are previously defined by an expert. It is built following prompt engineering principles\n[\n19\n,\n20\n]\nand is comprised of the following elements:\n•\nRole prompt\n: At the beginning of the system prompt, the model is given a role and general behaviors to follow during the BT planning.\n•\nObjects metadata\n: Object poses\np\ni\np_{i}\n, and specific locations are given in the prompt, assuming they are prior known. They are labelled to be clearly understandable from the model, not a source of confusion, and are given in code format. Poses can be given both numerically or as a placeholder.\n•\nInstruction following pipeline\n: In this subsection of the prompt, the model is instructed on how to interpret user instructions and how to act while building a plan.\n•\nExpected behaviors\n: In this section, all the expected behaviors during execution of the BT are included (e.g.\nAlways restore the environment to its original state after each measurement.\n).\n•\n𝒞\n\\mathcal{C}\nand\n𝒜\n\\mathcal{A}\nlist\n: All possible composites and actions that the VLM can use to build the behavior are listed with a clear and concise explanation of them. Only useful information is given to the model, without entering the details of the implementation. For actions of\n𝒜\n\\mathcal{A}\n, expected input and obtained output are further detailed.\n•\nInput description\n: The input\n𝒟\n\\mathcal{D}\n,\nℛ\n\\mathcal{R}\nand\nℐ\n\\mathcal{I}\nthat the model should expect from the user is described, and a placeholder for the user prompt is placed for better understandability for the model.\n•\nOutput description and example\n: The expected output is detailed explained to the model with an example of a full running BT. This will allow the model to return the desired structure, which can then be executed on the robot with BT libraries.\nWhile our approach relies on a fixed, engineered system prompt, this prompt does not encode task-specific exploration strategies or heuristics. Instead, it defines a task-agnostic interface over a set of atomic actions and expected behaviors, enabling the VLM to autonomously infer which parameters are required and how to acquire them based solely on user intent and scene context. As such, prompt engineering is used as a structural prior rather than as a substitute for planning or domain expertise.\nAction set\n𝒜\n\\mathcal{A}\nInput\nOutput & Utility\nMovePose\ndesired pose\nMoves gripper to a\ndesired cartesian pose\nMoveJoints\ndesired joints’\npositions\nMoves joints\nin desired\nconfiguration\nOpenGripper\nNone\nOpens the gripper\nCloseGripper\nNone\nCloses the gripper\nMoveDownUntillContact\nNone\nMoves gripper\ndown until a\ncontact is detected\nMeasureGripperPose\nNone\nMeasures the pose\nof the gripper tips\nMeasureForces\nNone\nMeasures the\nforce applied\non gripper\nMeasureMass\nNone\nMeasures the\nmass of the\npicked object\nTABLE I:\nList of atomic actions\n𝒜\n\\mathcal{A}\nthat the model can use to create the BT, with relative input and description.\nIII-C\n2\nSimulation description\n𝒟\n\\mathcal{D}\nThis prompt is embedded in the system prompt using a specific place_holder.

It is a given instruction or a sequence from the user. On top of this, the VLM will build the BT needed to satisfy, if it is possible, all the tasks. It is given in natural language, and it is the variable part of the textual prompt.\nIII-C\n4\nImage\nℐ\n\\mathcal{I}\nThe image is fed to VLM with a text prompt; it is variable and gives the model awareness of the environment in which the robot will operate. Our key assumption is that the working space is static and the robot is the only entity that can act on this. Image is RGB and is crucial for BT planning (as shown in Sec.\nV-A\n5\nand Sec.\nV-C\n). As shown in Sec\nV-A\n3\n,\nℐ\n\\mathcal{I}\ncan be both a real image or a synthetic.\nAt the current stage, vision is involved in the pipeline only during behavior planning.\nIII-D\nRobotic Execution and Data Acquisition\nThe generated BT is executed on a Franka Emika Panda robot equipped with torque sensing. Each leaf node triggers a corresponding controller primitive. To enable compliant interaction with the environment, we use Cartesian impedance control, which generates joint torques according to both the end-effector pose error and the robot’s joint posture:\n𝝉\n=\n𝐉\n⊤\n​\n[\n−\n𝐊\n​\n(\n𝐱\n−\n𝐱\nd\n)\n−\n𝐃\n​\n(\n𝐉\n​\n𝐪\n˙\n)\n]\n⏟\nCartesian impedance\n+\n𝐂\n​\n(\n𝐪\n,\n𝐪\n˙\n)\n⏟\nCoriolis compensation\n+\n(\n𝐈\n−\n𝐉\n⊤\n​\n𝐉\n+\n)\n​\n[\nk\nns\n​\n(\n𝐪\nd\n−\n𝐪\n)\n−\n2\n​\nk\nns\n​\n𝐪\n˙\n]\n⏟\nNullspace PD\n\\boldsymbol{\\tau}=\\underbrace{\\mathbf{J}^{\\top}\\left[-\\mathbf{K}(\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{x}_{d})-\\mathbf{D}(\\mathbf{J}\\dot{\\mathbf{q}})\\right]}_{\\text{Cartesian impedance}}+\\underbrace{\\mathbf{C}(\\mathbf{q},\\dot{\\mathbf{q}})}_{\\text{Coriolis compensation}}+\\\\\n\\underbrace{(\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{J}^{\\top}\\mathbf{J}^{+})\\left[k_{\\text{ns}}(\\mathbf{q}_{d}-\\mathbf{q})-2\\sqrt{k_{\\text{ns}}}\\dot{\\mathbf{q}}\\right]}_{\\text{Nullspace PD}}\n(1)\n𝐱\n∈\nℝ\n6\n\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{6}\nis the current end-effector pose (position and orientation),\n𝐱\nd\n∈\nℝ\n6\n\\mathbf{x}_{d}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{6}\nis the desired equilibrium pose,\n𝐪\n,\n𝐪\n˙\n∈\nℝ\n7\n\\mathbf{q},\\dot{\\mathbf{q}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{7}\nare the joint positions and velocities,\n𝐪\nd\n∈\nℝ\n7\n\\mathbf{q}_{d}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{7}\nis the desired joint configuration for nullspace stabilization,\n𝐉\n​\n(\n𝐪\n)\n∈\nℝ\n6\n×\n7\n\\mathbf{J}(\\mathbf{q})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{6\\times 7}\nis the geometric Jacobian,\n𝐊\n,\n𝐃\n∈\nℝ\n6\n×\n6\n\\mathbf{K},\\mathbf{D}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{6\\times 6}\nare the Cartesian stiffness and Cartesian damping matrices,\nk\nns\nk_{\\text{ns}}\nis the nullspace stiffness scalar,\n𝐉\n+\n\\mathbf{J}^{+}\nis the pseudoinverse of\n𝐉\n⊤\n\\mathbf{J}^{\\top}\nand\n𝐂\n​\n(\n𝐪\n,\n𝐪\n˙\n)\n\\mathbf{C}(\\mathbf{q},\\dot{\\mathbf{q}})\ncompensates for Coriolis forces.\nThis formulation ensures compliant and safe interaction with the environment, allowing the robot to adapt to contact forces during pushing, surface exploration, or other manipulation tasks while maintaining a preferred\nposture in its nullspace\n[\n8\n]\n.\nDuring execution, we record the needed parameters for digital twin construction when a proper action is triggered. Therefore, the data are acquired and processed only when needed, augmenting interpretability for the user.\nIV\nExperimental Setup\nWe validated the proposed Real2Sim pipeline through a series of real-robot experiments involving contact-rich interactions, multi-modal scene understanding, and simulation construction. The experimental setup integrates a visual perception system, the VLM-driven autonomous BT generation and execution framework, and the construction of a MuJoCo simulation environment.\nIV-A\nHardware Platform\nExperiments were conducted using a Franka Emika Panda manipulator equipped with 7-DoF torque-controlled arm, built-in joint torque sensing, a parallel-jaw gripper with position feedback, and real-time Cartesian impedance control and joint trajectory controller.\nA single static RGB camera (Intel RealSense D435i) was positioned to observe the tabletop workspace. In the current implementation, 3D object poses are provided in the system prompt (Sec.\nIII-C\n1\n).\nIV-B\nVLM–Driven BT Generation and Execution\nThe RGB image\nℐ\n\\mathcal{I}\nand user request\nℛ\n\\mathcal{R}\nare processed by a VLM (ChatGPT-5), which produces a structured action plan in the form described in Sec.\nIII\n. The plan is parsed into an executable BT using the Python\npy_trees\nlibrary.\nThe BT is executed in real time on the Panda robot using ROS Noetic. Each leaf node triggers a specific movement primitive, such as moving to a certain Cartesian pose, opening the gripper, or descending until contact, as reported in the Tab.\nI\n. Sensor data generated during BT execution are logged for subsequent parameter estimation.\nThe measurements capture the robot–object interaction dynamics and provide the data necessary to estimate the object’s mass, friction, and surface height for simulation building.\nIV-C\nPhysical Parameter Estimation\nPhysical properties\nΦ\n\\Phi\nare directly estimated from the recorded interaction data.\nIV-C\n1\nMass Estimation\nDuring quasi-static lifting, the external wrench\n𝒘\next\n\\boldsymbol{w}_{\\text{ext}}\nat the end-effector is recovered from joint torques\n𝝉\n\\boldsymbol{\\tau}\nvia\n𝒘\nee\n=\n𝐉\n​\n(\nq\n)\n−\n⊤\n​\n𝝉\n,\n\\boldsymbol{w}_{\\text{ee}}=\\mathbf{J}(q)^{-\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\tau},\nwhere\nJ\n​\n(\nq\n)\nJ(q)\nis the manipulator Jacobian and\n𝒘\nee\n=\n[\nF\nx\n,\nF\ny\n,\nF\nz\n,\nτ\nx\n,\nτ\ny\n,\nτ\nz\n]\n\\boldsymbol{w}_{\\text{ee}}=[F_{x},F_{y},F_{z},\\tau_{x},\\tau_{y},\\tau_{z}]\n.\nThe vertical force component yields the estimated mass:\nm\n=\nF\nz\ng\nm=\\frac{F_{z}}{g}\n.\nIV-C\n2\nFriction Estimation\nDuring a planar push with measured tangential force\nF\n∥\nF_{\\parallel}\nfrom (\nIV-C\n1\n), the friction coefficient is:\nμ\n=\nF\n∥\nm\n​\ng\n\\mu=\\frac{F_{\\parallel}}{mg}\n, in both static\nμ\ns\n\\mu_{s}\nand dynamic case\nμ\nd\n\\mu_{d}\n.\nIV-C\n3\nSurface Height Estimation\nA torque threshold\nτ\nc\n\\tau_{c}\nindicates contact and knowing the end-effector pose\n[\nx\ne\n​\ne\n,\ny\ne\n​\ne\n,\nz\ne\n​\ne\n,\nα\nx\ne\n​\ne\n,\nα\ny\ne\n​\ne\n,\nα\nz\ne\n​\ne\n]\n[x_{ee},y_{ee},z_{ee},\\alpha_{x_{ee}},\\alpha_{y_{ee}},\\alpha_{z_{ee}}]\n:\nh\n=\nz\nee\n−\nd\noffset\nh=z_{\\text{ee}}-d_{\\text{offset}}\n,\nwhere\nd\noffset\nd_{\\text{offset}}\nis the calibrated base offset and is known.\nIV-D\nSimulation Environment\nThe estimated parameters are directly integrated into a MuJoCo\n[\n18\n]\nenvironment. Objects’ graphical representations are instantiated using:\n•\nconvex hulls or simplified meshes for geometry,\n•\nmeasured\nΦ\n\\Phi\nparameters,\n•\nreconstructed placement and dimensions.\nV\nExperiments and Results\nThree experimental scenarios were implemented to test the depicted framework. We demonstrate that, unlike scripted Real2Sim pipelines based on pre-defined exploration routines and expert-designed measurement procedures, the proposed framework automatically generates task-specific behavior trees from a high-level user request. This eliminates the need for robotics or system identification expertise during execution, while enabling adaptive and interpretable physical parameter acquisition. The evaluation focuses on real-robot experiments that assess estimation accuracy, robustness to occlusions, and the ability to autonomously adapt the interaction strategy to different user intents. Quantitative comparisons against existing Real2Sim pipelines are not directly applicable, as prior approaches rely on fixed, task-agnostic exploration routines and estimate a predefined set of physical parameters, making them not directly comparable to the proposed intent-driven and selective acquisition framework.\nIn the first scenario, the user wants to build a simulation of a scene with objects on top of a table, in which knowledge of object mass, as well as table height, is required. In the second scenario, the user wants to know the friction coefficients, both static and dynamic. In the third, it is asked to estimate the mass of an object, which is occluded by another one, preventing a direct estimate of the mass of the object below. Note that\n𝒜\n\\mathcal{A}\nis the same for all three scenarios, while specific actions are needed for specific data acquisition. Measurements are reported as mean and standard deviation, computed across repeated measurements.\nV-A\nFirst scenario - Table Height and Object Properties\nIn this scenario, the model is asked to build a simulation in which the object\no\n1\no_{1}\nmass (\nϕ\n1\n\\phi_{1}\n) is required together with the table\no\n2\no_{2}\nheight (\nϕ\n2\n\\phi_{2}\n), to perform some tasks in a simulated environment. For this specific case,\no\n1\no_{1}\nis a water bottle filled with different water quantities. The same quantities are measured by hand and compared with true results.\nFigure 2:\nExample of BT generated for the estimation of table height and mass of the blue bottle. First, the robot executes the sub-tree to acquire the table height, then it executes the other to acquire the bottle mass. As it is possible to see from the second subtree, the VLM is instructed to approach objects before moving to their poses for picking.\nNote that each sub-tree is built with a composition of atomic actions from set\n𝒜\n\\mathcal{A}\n.\nV-A\n1\nBottle mass and table height estimation\nIn this setup, the robot is explicitly asked to estimate\nϕ\n1\n\\phi_{1}\nand\nϕ\n2\n\\phi_{2}\n(for this first case,\n𝒟\n\\mathcal{D}\nis not given in the prompt):\n•\nUser request\nℛ\n\\mathcal{R}\n:\nWe want to build a simulation of the environment that you see from the camera, but we don’t know the mass of the bottle and the height of the table on which the object is.\nThe image\nℐ\n\\mathcal{I}\ngiven to the VLM is the one reported in Fig.\n5\non the left. Results obtained from measurements for one bottle filled with water and table height are reported in Tab.\nII\n, and a sequence of performed actions is reported in Fig.\n3\n. The VLM showed the capability of composing actions of the given\n𝒜\n\\mathcal{A}\nset, to build composite operations for parameter estimation. The generated BT is reported in Fig.\n2\n.\nFigure 3:\nFirst scenario sequence of parameters estimation. The robot first touches the table to acquire its height with the end-effector pose. Then it lifts the bottle to acquire that mass with torque sensors and then puts the object in its original position.\nObject\nParameter\nAcquired Measure\nManual measure\nBottle\nmass [Kg]\nmean=\n0.257\n0.257\n, std=\n0.022\n0.022\nmass=\n0.254\n0.254\nTable\nheight [m]\nmean=\n0.764226\n0.764226\n,\nstd=\n0.000039\n0.000039\nheight=\n0.765\n0.765\nTABLE II:\nObjects and estimated parameters for real2sim.\nWhile engineering the output prompt description (Sec.\nIII-C\n1\n), we saw that it is useful to provide the model with one or more examples of what the desired structured outcome is. These examples showed a strong influence in VLM outcome. If, for instance, the pick-up of an object is included as an example of structured text in\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\n, the VLM reproduces the same behavior explicited in the example while picking an object, anticipating or postponing the gripper opening to the approach phase with respect to what the example shows. This suggests the opportunity to tune robot behavior by feeding useful examples in the VLM prompt, enhancing human-like behaviors.\nV-A\n2\nKnown\n𝒟\n\\mathcal{D}\nThe\n.xml\nfile (\n𝒟\n\\mathcal{D}\n) of the MuJoCo simulation is incorporated in the system prompt of the VLM as additive data. In this way, the user is not required to specify which parameters\nϕ\ni\n\\phi_{i}\nare missing to build the simulation. The model will autonomously derive which strategy should be applied to acquire all of them. As in the previous test, the\n𝒟\n\\mathcal{D}\nis given without table height and bottle mass. The BT generated is the same as reported in Fig.\n2\n. Adding\nϕ\n2\n\\phi_{2}\nto the\n𝒟\n\\mathcal{D}\nfile, the model built a plan to estimate\nϕ\n1\n\\phi_{1}\nonly, as reported in Fig.\n4\n. This shows the ability of the model to discern available\nϕ\ni\n\\phi_{i}\nparameters from missing ones, due to\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\ndesign.\nFigure 4:\nBT generated for bottles mass acquisition only, when\n𝒟\n\\mathcal{D}\nis available, and table height is known.\nV-A\n3\nSynthetic\nℐ\n\\mathcal{I}\ngeneration\nThe model was asked to build a strategy for physical parameters estimation based on a synthetic representation of the environment in image\nℐ\n\\mathcal{I}\n. Real scenario and synthetic image created with MuJoCo simulation are both reported in Fig.\n5\n. The BT generated resulted in the same as the one obtained with the real image. Different scenes are tested and, in all cases, the composition of elementary actions is the same. This suggests the opportunity to build datasets and train models on top of them for high-level planning on synthetic\nℐ\n\\mathcal{I}\nand then deploy them on real word scenario without adaptation. However, atomic actions set\n𝒜\n\\mathcal{A}\nhave to be implemented in such a way that allows deployment in the real world.\nFigure 5:\nReal environment\nℐ\n\\mathcal{I}\npicture from camera (left) and simulation\nℐ\n\\mathcal{I}\nof it (right). When the simulation image is used as a prompt, only a graphical representation with bottle meshes is used.\nV-A\n4\nMore\n𝒪\n\\mathcal{O}\nin the setup\nFor the same case, three bottles of different colours (blue\no\n1\no_{1}\n, green\no\n2\no_{2}\n, and pink\no\n3\no_{3}\n) were put on top of the same table\no\n4\no_{4}\n. The user asks in\nℛ\n\\mathcal{R}\nthe robot to acquire masses of the three bottles (\nϕ\n1\n\\phi_{1}\n,\nϕ\n2\n\\phi_{2}\n,\nϕ\n3\n\\phi_{3}\n) but in\n𝒟\n\\mathcal{D}\n, only the green bottle’s mass (\nϕ\n3\n\\phi_{3}\n) is missing. All three poses\np\n1\np_{1}\n,\np\n2\np_{2}\n, and\np\n3\np_{3}\nare given as metadata, while\n𝒟\n\\mathcal{D}\nand\nℛ\n\\mathcal{R}\nspecify the task. As it is possible to see from Fig.\n6\n, the BT generated by the model makes the robot lift and weigh the green bottle, without using the others.\nFigure 6:\nThe sequence shows the robot picking up only the bottle whose mass should be estimated.\nV-A\n5\nModel Hallucinations\nThe VLM may have hallucinations\n[\n6\n]\n, pretending to use objects that are not present in the image\nℐ\n\\mathcal{I}\nbut present in the user request\nℛ\n\\mathcal{R}\n.\nIn\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\n, the model is specifically asked to rely on\nℐ\n\\mathcal{I}\nfor the plan, and then check if the pose is available in metadata; if the object\no\ni\no_{i}\nis available in both cases,\no\ni\n∈\n𝒪\no_{i}\\in\\mathcal{O}\nand the plan is then included in the BT. So the system prompt is engineered against hallucinations, and then tested. For instance, the model is asked to pick up a yellow bottle that is not present in the environment picture\nℐ\n\\mathcal{I}\n. If a fictitious pose of the yellow bottle is present or not in\nS\nS\n, the model does not include the task in the BT, basing its analysis on\nℐ\n\\mathcal{I}\n.\nV-B\nSecond scenario - Friction Parameters\nIn the second scenario, the VLM is asked to estimate the friction parameters while moving\no\n1\no_{1}\n. In this setup, the robot is required to acquire measurements while performing an action (pushing the object).\nThis task implies the execution of two different actions in order to estimate the parameter: weigh\nϕ\n1\n\\phi_{1}\n, and then push\no\n1\no_{1}\nto acquire the sliding force\nϕ\n2\n\\phi_{2}\n.\nV-B\n1\nUnachievable task & output and explanation text\nAs it is possible to see from Tab.\nI\n, there is no specific action to estimate friction with the robot within\n𝒜\n\\mathcal{A}\n. The robot can move the objects and, in parallel, acquire the vector of the forces applied on the end effector, but it can’t give the friction parameter to the user. So the model is not able to satisfy the user’s request. In this situation,\nℰ\n\\mathcal{E}\nbecomes crucial.\n•\nOutput text\nℰ\n\\mathcal{E}\n:\nThe BT measures the mass of the blue bottle, captures forces during a sliding motion along x to enable friction estimation, and measures table height. Derived parameters like friction coefficients can be computed by the user from these measurements.\nThis will not allow the model to do a specific measurement, but allows the robot to perform enough actions to let a human operator derive the friction coefficients.\nNumerical results of friction and mass estimation are reported in Tab.\nIII\n. As it is possible to see from the table, friction parameters are consistent but with high variance, while mass estimation is more precise.\nFigure 7:\nThe sequence shows the robot lifting the bottle and sliding it to acquire parameters needed to find friction coefficients.\nObject\nEstimated mass [Kg]\nEstimated friction coeff.\nBlue bottle\nmean=0.598, std=0.017\nμ\ns\n\\mu_{s}\n: mean=0.41, std=0.11\nμ\nd\n\\mu_{d}\n: mean=0.34, std=0.20\nTABLE III:\nBlue bottle estimated parameters.\nV-C\nThird scenario - Object Occlusion\nIn this scenario, the VLM is asked to estimate the mass (\nϕ\n1\n\\phi_{1}\n) of a small blue box\no\n1\no_{1}\nthat is piled with another red box\no\n2\no_{2}\non top of it. As reported in Sec.\nIII-C\n, the model is given the possibility to place useless objects that prevent the achievement of the goal in a specific temporary pose\nx\n1\nx_{1}\n. The robot is asked through\nℛ\n\\mathcal{R}\nto estimate the mass of\no\n1\no_{1}\n, without specifying that it is below the red one as text and giving\n𝒟\n\\mathcal{D}\n. As\np\n1\np_{1}\nand\np\n2\np_{2}\nmay help the model to build the plan with\nz\nz\ncomponent, only for this case, it is specified that the poses are known for both the boxes with a variable, but they were not given numerically. From the sequence of actions shown in Fig.\n8\n, it is possible to see how the model creates a BT that allows the robot to execute a task, even if the object\no\n1\no_{1}\nis placed below\no\n2\no_{2}\n. This enhances the capability of the model of planning complex behaviors for parameter acquisition with a set of atomic actions\n𝒜\n\\mathcal{A}\n.\nFigure 8:\nThe sequence shows the robot putting the red block in a temporary position first. Then it lifts the blue block to weigh it and finally restores the original setup configuration.\nObject\nEstimated mass [Kg]\nHand measured mass [Kg]\nBlue box\nman=0.022, std=0.015\nmass=0.016\nTABLE IV:\nMass estimate for the blue box.\nVI\nConclusions and Future works\nThis paper presented an active perception Real2Sim framework for automated simulation construction that integrates multi-modal scene understanding, behavior-tree-based planning, and physical interaction with real robotic systems. By leveraging vision-language models to interpret user intent and scene context, the proposed approach autonomously determines which physical parameters are required for simulation and generates a structured, executable plan to acquire them through targeted robot interactions with a limited set of primitive actions.\nExperiments on a torque-controlled Franka Emika Panda robot demonstrate that the framework can accurately estimate physical properties such as object mass, surface height, and friction-related measurements, even in challenging scenarios involving occlusions or incomplete prior models. The use of behavior trees ensures interpretable, reactive, and safe execution, while the reliance on a minimal set of atomic actions enables flexible composition of complex interaction strategies without task-specific reprogramming.\nOverall, this work moves toward autonomous, intent-driven Real2Sim pipelines that tightly couple high-level reasoning with physically grounded automated robotic interaction, supporting scalable simulation generation for robotics automation and learning.\nFuture works will relax known-poses assumptions, in particular through vision-based pose estimation like\n[\n22\n]\n, as RGB-D from the camera feed contains sufficient information for integration.\nFurthermore, a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of digital twin fidelity remains an important direction for the future. This includes systematic real–simulation comparisons across multiple tasks, metrics on trajectory and force prediction errors, and closed-loop policy transfer performance. Finally, future works will integrate works like those discussed in Sec.\nII-B\nto autonomously build a complete simulation, embedding both graphical and physical elements.\nReferences\n[1]\nF.

  "preview_text": "Constructing an accurate simulation model of real-world environments requires reliable estimation of physical parameters such as mass, geometry, friction, and contact surfaces. Traditional real-to-simulation (Real2Sim) pipelines rely on manual measurements or fixed, pre-programmed exploration routines, which limit their adaptability to varying tasks and user intents. This paper presents a Real2Sim framework that autonomously generates and executes Behavior Trees for task-specific physical interactions to acquire only the parameters required for a given simulation objective, without relying on pre-defined task templates or expert-designed exploration routines. Given a high-level user request, an incomplete simulation description, and an RGB observation of the scene, a vision-language model performs multi-modal reasoning to identify relevant objects, infer required physical parameters, and generate a structured Behavior Tree composed of elementary robotic actions. The resulting behavior is executed on a torque-controlled Franka Emika Panda, enabling compliant, contact-rich interactions for parameter estimation. The acquired measurements are used to automatically construct a physics-aware simulation. Experimental results on the real manipulator demonstrate estimation of object mass, surface height, and friction-related quantities across multiple scenarios, including occluded objects and incomplete prior models. The proposed approach enables interpretable, intent-driven, and autonomously Real2Sim pipelines, bridging high-level reasoning with physically-grounded robotic interaction.\n\nReal2Sim based on Active Perception with automatically VLM-generated Behavior Trees\nAlessandro Adami\n∗,†\n, Sebastian Zudaire\n§\n, Ruggero Carli\n∗\n, Pietro Falco\n∗\nFunder: Project co-funded by the European Union – Next Generation Eu - under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP), Mission 4 Component 2, Investment 3.3 – Decree no. 630 (24th April 2024) of Italian Ministry of Universit",

      "answer": "## 论文评价指标与数据集分析\n\n该论文提出的是一个**自主、任务驱动的物理参数估计与仿真构建框架**，其核心贡献在于**方法论的创新**，而非在标准数据集上进行性能比较。因此，论文**没有使用传统意义上的公开基准数据集（如YCB、ShapeNet）或统一的量化评价指标（如mAP、RMSE）**来进行横向对比。\n\n其评估方式是基于**真实机器人平台上的多个定制化场景实验**，以**证明框架的功能性、适应性和意图驱动能力**。评价的核心是 **“能否成功完成任务”** 以及 **“估计参数的准确性”**。\n\n### 1. 评价指标（功能性与准确性验证）\n\n论文通过以下**非标准化但具体可测的指标**来验证系统：\n\n| 评价维度 | 具体指标与细节 | 说明 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **任务完成成功率** | 系统能否根据用户指令（`ℛ`）和场景图像（`ℐ`）**自动生成并成功执行**正确的行为树（BT）。 | 这是**核心功能指标**。论文通过三个场景的演示，表明VLM能生成可执行且逻辑正确的BT，机器人能按计划完成交互。 |\n| **参数估计准确性** | 将机器人测量得到的物理参数与**人工测量真值**进行对比。 | **主要量化指标**。用于验证通过机器人交互估计的物理参数的可靠性。 |\n| **估计一致性（精度）** | 对同一参数进行**多次重复测量**，计算其**均值（mean）和标准差（std）**。 | 标准差反映了测量过程的**可重复性和噪声水平**，评估了数据采集的稳定性。 |\n| **系统适应性** | 1. **场景理解**：能否处理物体遮挡、先验信息不全等情况。<br>2. **意图理解**：能否根据不完整的仿真描述（`𝒟`）自动推断缺失参数。<br>3. **策略生成**：能否用同一套原子动作集（`𝒜`）组合出不同任务的探索策略。 | 这些是**定性但关键的评估点**，通过设计不同的实验场景（如下文数据集）来展示。 |\n| **抗幻觉能力** | 当用户指令提及图像中不存在的物体时，系统**是否会在BT中生成相关操作**。 | 通过特定测试验证系统提示（`𝒮`）工程的有效性，确保规划基于真实视觉观察。 |\n\n**参数估计准确性的计算细节（来自论文第IV-C节）：**\n- **质量估计**：`m = F_z / g`。通过阻抗控制抬起物体，从末端执行器测得的垂直力 `F_z`（由关节扭矩经雅可比矩阵转换得到）除以重力加速度 `g` 计算。\n- **摩擦系数估计**：`μ = F_∥ / (m * g)`。在已知质量 `m` 后，通过推动物体并测量切向力 `F_∥` 来计算。\n- **表面高度估计**：`h = z_ee - d_offset`。通过“向下移动直至接触”的动作，在检测到接触阈值时记录末端执行器的Z轴位置 `z_ee`，减去已知的校准偏移量 `d_offset`。\n\n### 2. “数据集”/实验场景细节\n\n论文的验证完全在**真实机器人（Franka Emika Panda）** 上进行的**实物场景实验**，没有使用预收集的离线数据集。这些场景是专门设计来测试框架不同能力的：\n\n| 场景编号与名称 | 场景设置与目标 | 测试的核心能力 | 关键结果（来自论文第V节） |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **场景一**<br>桌面高度与物体属性 | **设置**：桌面上放一个水瓶。<br>**目标**：估计**瓶子质量**和**桌子高度**。<br>**变体**：1) 提供/不提供仿真描述(`𝒟`); 2) 使用**合成图像**替代真实图像；3) 多物体中选择性测量；4) 测试幻觉。 | 1. **基础参数获取能力**<br>2. **与先验信息(`𝒟`)的集成**<br>3. **从仿真到现实的迁移潜力**<br>4. **任务相关推理**<br>5. **抗幻觉** | - 质量估计：0.257±0.022 kg (真值0.254 kg)。<br>- 高度估计：0.764226±0.000039 m (真值0.765 m)。<br>- 给定`𝒟`时，仅生成缺失参数的BT。<br>- 合成图像引导生成的BT与真实图像一致。 |\n| **场景二**<br>摩擦参数 | **设置**：桌面上放一个瓶子。<br>**目标**：用户请求估计**静摩擦和动摩擦系数**。 | **处理无法直接测量的参数**（因为原子动作集`𝒜`中没有直接“测摩擦”的动作）。 | 系统生成BT来测量**质量**和**滑动过程中的力**，并输出解释文本(`ℰ`)，告知用户可基于这些数据自行计算摩擦系数。展示了在动作受限下的**妥协与解释能力**。 |\n| **场景三**<br>物体遮挡 | **设置**：一个小蓝盒被一个红盒完全压在下面。<br>**目标**：估计**被遮挡蓝盒的质量**。 | **解决复杂物理约束的规划能力**（需先移开障碍物）。 | 系统成功生成BT，顺序执行：1) 将红盒移至临时位置；2) 测量蓝盒质量；3) 恢复原场景。证明了组合原子动作解决复杂任务的能力。 |\n\n### 总结\n该论文的评估范式是 **“面向任务的系统演示与验证”** ，而非 **“基于基准的量化对比”** 。其**评价指标**紧密围绕**系统核心创新点**：\n1.  **意图驱动的自主性**（能否根据目标生成正确计划）。\n2.  **物理交互的准确性**（测量值是否可靠）。\n3.  **系统的鲁棒性与适应性**（能否处理遮挡、先验信息不全等复杂情况）。\n\n其 **“数据集”** 实质是**一系列精心设计的真实物理实验场景**，旨在全面展示框架在**脱离固定脚本、依赖高层指令**的情况下，完成多样化Real2Sim参数获取任务的能力。这种评估方式强烈突出了其**实际应用价值**——为构建高保真数字孪生提供了一种自动化、可解释且无需机器人专家全程干预的新路径。",

      "answer": "## 论文实验与评估分析\n\n### 实验数据集与场景\n本文**未使用**传统的离线数据集进行训练或评估。所有实验均在**真实物理机器人平台（Franka Emika Panda）**上，通过构建**三种不同的桌面场景**进行验证。实验的核心是评估框架在**真实世界交互**中自主生成行为树并估计物理参数的能力。\n\n实验场景具体包括：\n1.  **第一场景：桌面高度与物体质量估计**\n    *   **对象**：装有不同水量（用于改变质量）的瓶子、一张桌子。\n    *   **任务**：根据用户请求，估计瓶子质量和桌面高度。\n2.  **第二场景：摩擦参数估计**\n    *   **对象**：一个瓶子。\n    *   **任务**：估计瓶子与桌面间的静摩擦和动摩擦系数。\n3.  **第三场景：物体遮挡下的质量估计**\n    *   **对象**：一个被红色方块完全覆盖的蓝色小方块。\n    *   **任务**：在存在遮挡的情况下，估计下方蓝色方块的质量。\n\n### 主要评估指标\n由于本文提出的是一个全新的、**意图驱动**的Real2Sim流程，其评估重点不在于超越某个基线模型的精度，而在于**验证框架的整体可行性、适应性和自主性**。主要评估指标包括：\n\n1.  **参数估计准确性**：将机器人自动测量的物理参数与**人工手动测量**的“真实值”进行对比。\n    *   **质量**：估计质量（kg）与手工测量质量的对比。\n    *   **高度**：估计桌面高度（m）与手工测量高度的对比。\n    *   **摩擦系数**：通过测量推力和质量计算得出的摩擦系数（无量纲）。\n\n2.  **系统自主性与适应性**：通过以下方面定性评估：\n    *   **行为树生成能力**：VLM能否根据不同的用户请求（`ℛ`）和场景图像（`ℐ`）生成正确、可执行的行为树。\n    *   **任务感知能力**：当仿真描述（`𝒟`）中已包含部分参数时，系统是否仅针对缺失参数生成测量计划。\n    *   **处理复杂情况的能力**：能否处理物体遮挡、使用合成图像进行规划、以及处理多物体场景中指定物体的测量。\n    *   **解释性输出**：当任务无法完全自动化完成时（如摩擦系数估计），VLM能否输出解释文本（`ℰ`）指导用户。\n\n### 性能结果与提升\n论文未提供与现有方法的直接量化对比（如准确率提升百分比），因为传统Real2Sim方法依赖于固定的、预编程的探索流程，与本文的**意图驱动、按需测量**范式不具直接可比性。核心性能体现在所提出框架的**独特能力**上：\n\n1.  **准确的物理参数估计**（定量结果）：\n    *   **质量估计**：对水瓶的测量结果接近手工测量值（例如：估计均值0.257 kg vs. 手工0.254 kg）。\n    *   **高度估计**：桌面高度估计非常精确且方差极小（均值0.764226 m，标准差0.000039 m）。\n    *   **摩擦估计**：能够获得合理的摩擦系数估计值（静摩擦~0.41，动摩擦~0.34），但方差相对较大，反映了动态交互测量的挑战。\n\n2.  **关键性能提升**（定性/系统性贡献）：\n    *   **从“固定流程”到“意图驱动”**：这是最主要的提升。系统能理解“为什么”要测量（用户目标），从而自动决定“测量什么”和“如何测量”，避免了传统方法中不必要的、 exhaustive的参数测量。\n    *   **从“高级技能”到“原子动作”**：与之前使用VLM生成行为树的工作不同，本文直接基于低层原子动作（如移动到某姿势、开合夹爪、测量力）进行规划，实现了更精细、更物理 grounded 的交互控制，直接服务于参数获取。\n    *   **增强了可解释性与鲁棒性**：生成的行为树为整个探索过程提供了清晰、模块化的蓝图。同时，行为树固有的反应式特性允许机器人在执行过程中根据传感器反馈（如接触检测）进行实时调整。\n    *   **展示了多场景适应性**：实验成功涵盖了**多物体选择性测量**、**存在遮挡**、**结合先验仿真描述**、**使用合成图像规划**等多种复杂情况，证明了框架的广泛适用性。\n\n**总结**：本文的实验不是在标准数据集上评估指标，而是在真实机器人上验证一个**全新框架的可行性**。其“性能提升”体现在开创了一种**自主、自适应、可解释的Real2Sim新范式**，能够根据高层语义目标，动态生成物理交互策略来获取最小必要参数集，从而在构建数字孪生时显著提升效率和任务相关性。",

      "question": "论文的主要局限性有哪些？未来可能的改进方向是什么？",
      "answer": "## 论文主要局限性分析\n\n基于对论文内容的深入分析，本文提出的框架虽然具有创新性，但仍存在以下几个主要局限性：\n\n- **对先验信息的依赖**：系统假设物体的3D位姿（`p_i`）在规划时是已知的，并作为元数据提供给VLM。这在实际应用中是一个强假设，限制了系统在完全未知、非结构化环境中的自主性。\n- **感知与规划的分离**：视觉感知（RGB图像）仅用于初始的行为树（BT）规划阶段，**并未与机器人的实时执行形成闭环**。这意味着执行过程中如果场景发生意外变化（如物体被意外移动），系统无法动态调整计划。\n- **原子动作集的工程化约束**：机器人可执行的原子动作集（`𝒜`）是预先定义且固定的。虽然组合性强，但**其能力和范围限制了VLM所能规划的任务复杂性和类型**。例如，论文中提到无法直接测量摩擦系数，只能提供原始力数据让用户自行计算。\n- **VLM的可靠性问题**：尽管通过系统提示词（`𝒮`）工程来缓解，但VLM仍可能存在**幻觉或推理错误**，导致生成不合理或不安全的行为树。系统的稳健性依赖于底层大模型的多模态推理能力。\n- **缺乏全面的仿真保真度量化评估**：论文展示了参数估计的准确性（如质量、高度），但**未对构建的数字孪生（Digital Twin）进行系统性的仿真-现实一致性验证**，例如在仿真中执行控制策略并对比真实轨迹的误差。\n- **场景静态假设**：系统假设工作空间在机器人执行期间是静态的，且机器人是唯一能够改变场景的实体。这**限制了其在动态或人机协作场景中的应用**。\n\n## 未来可能的改进方向\n\n针对上述局限性，论文在结论部分也展望了未来的工作，主要改进方向包括：\n\n- **集成视觉位姿估计**：**放松对已知位姿的假设**，通过集成如FoundationPose等6D位姿估计模型，直接从RGB-D相机数据中实时获取物体位姿，实现完全基于视觉的自主感知-规划闭环。\n- **实现实时感知-执行闭环**：将视觉反馈引入行为树的执行循环中，使机器人能够**根据实时感知信息（如接触状态、物体位置变化）动态调整或重构行为树**，提高在非结构化环境中的鲁棒性。\n- **扩展原子动作集与技能库**：在现有低层原子动作基础上，**引入或学习更高层的技能基元**（如“估计摩擦系数”），平衡灵活性与任务效率。同时，探索从交互数据中自动发现或学习新动作的可能性。\n- **进行系统的数字孪生保真度评估**：未来工作应包含**严格的仿真与现实对比实验**，定义量化指标（如轨迹跟踪误差、接触力预测误差、策略迁移成功率），以全面评估所构建仿真模型的有效性。\n- **融合生成式AI进行完整仿真构建**：与论文第II-B节提到的生成式3D场景构建工作（如SceneSynthesis, EmbodiedGen）相结合，**实现从视觉外观到物理属性的全自动、高保真仿真环境生成**，超越当前仅关注物理参数估计的范畴。\n- **探索动态与非结构化场景**：研究在**轻微动态或存在干扰的环境**中如何安全、有效地进行参数估计，这可能涉及更复杂的行为树逻辑（如更频繁的条件检查、中断处理）以及对不确定性的显式建模。\n\n**总结**：该论文的核心价值在于提出了一个**意图驱动、可解释且自适应的Real2Sim新范式**，其局限性多源于当前阶段为保证系统可行性和安全性所做的合理简化。未来的改进方向清晰地指向增强感知自主性、闭环鲁棒性、评估严谨性以及与更前沿的生成式AI技术的融合，旨在最终实现**高度自动化、高保真且可扩展的仿真构建管道**。",
