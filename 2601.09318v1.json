The central idea is to encode the geometry of the robot\nfree space\n, together with the target location, into a scalar potential function known as a\nnavigation function\n. When used as a feedback control law, the negative gradient of a navigation function guides the robot safely to the target from almost any initial configuration while guaranteeing collision avoidance. As originally introduced in\n[\n1\n]\n, navigation functions are characterized by two fundamental properties:\n1.\nPolarity\n: the function admits a unique global minimum at the target configuration, while all other critical points are nondegenerate saddle points.\n2.\nAdmissibility\n: the function attains a uniform maximal value on the boundary of the free space, formed by workspace boundaries and obstacles.\nOver the past three decades, navigation functions have been successfully applied to a wide range of robotic systems and environments, including multi-agent coordination\n[\n2\n,\n3\n]\n, navigation in dynamic environments\n[\n4\n,\n5\n]\n, mobile manipulation\n[\n6\n]\n, and, more recently, learning-based navigation\n[\n7\n,\n8\n]\n. These developments highlight the value of navigation functions as a unifying framework connecting motion planning, control, and formal guarantees.\nMost classical constructions of navigation functions assume that the workspace outer boundary and internal obstacles are convex, and that the free space can be modeled as a so-called\nsphere world\n, where obstacles are represented by\nn\nn\n-dimensional spheres. Within this setting, smooth navigation functions with provable properties can be constructed using analytic expressions\n[\n1\n,\n9\n]\n. When obstacles deviate from spherical geometry, diffeomorphic coordinate transformations are commonly employed to map the free space into an equivalent spherical domain\n[\n10\n,\n11\n]\n. While theoretically possible, such transformations are highly environment dependent, computationally expensive, and difficult to extend to general 3-D settings.\nRealistic robotic environments are often inherently non-convex and populated by obstacles whose geometry cannot be adequately captured by spherical models. Examples include indoor environments with structural elements such as columns, beams, and walls, as well as parking-garage-like structures containing cylindrical and polyhedral features, as illustrated in Fig.\n1\n. These environments motivate the need for navigation-function constructions that operate directly in 3-D free spaces with complex obstacle geometry, without relying on global coordinate transformations.\nFigure 1:\nSimulation of a quadrotor navigating in a two-story parking garage. The environment consists of a non-convex polyhedral outer boundary together with cylindrical and spherical internal obstacles.\nRelated literature.\nNavigation functions are discussed in standard robotics texts such as\n[\n12\n]\n[Chap. 4],\n[\n13\n]\n[Chap. 8], and\n[\n14\n]\n[Chap. 10]. Extensions of navigation functions to partially known environments and sensor-driven settings were proposed in\n[\n15\n,\n16\n,\n17\n,\n18\n,\n19\n]\n. In addition, navigation-function have been used in the construction of control barrier functions\n[\n20\n]\nand in environments with moving obstacles\n[\n4\n,\n21\n]\n.\nBeyond spherical obstacles, several works have explored navigation functions defined over more general geometries. Filippidis\n[\n22\n]\nstudied conditions under which general smooth closed surfaces may serve as admissible obstacles, while Nicu\n[\n23\n]\ninvestigated navigation functions over convex polyhedral obstacles. Despite these advances, the construction and analysis of navigation functions in 3-D environments containing non-spherical obstacles, particularly cylindrical obstacles and their intersections, remain relatively underexplored.\nScope and contributions.\nThis technical report focuses on the theoretical foundations of navigation functions in 3-D workspaces populated by spherical and cylindrical obstacles. We present a unified polynomial framework for encoding such obstacles, including pairwise intersecting configurations, and analyze the resulting navigation functions from a differential and topological perspective. In particular, the contributions of this report are:\n•\na polynomial encoding of spherical and cylindrical obstacles suitable for 3-D navigation functions;\n•\nexplicit constructions of smooth navigation functions defined directly in 3-D free spaces;\n•\nanalysis of critical points via gradient and Hessian structure, establishing polarity and admissibility under mild conditions;\n•\ntreatment of pairwise intersecting obstacles using smooth composition techniques.\nThe emphasis of this report is on theoretical development and analysis. Algorithmic implementations, environment decomposition strategies, and large-scale planning architectures are intentionally excluded and will be addressed in future work.\nThe remainder of the report is organized as follows. Section\n2\nintroduces The 3-D model workspace and reviews the construction of navigation functions Section\n3\nanalyzes the critical point structure of the proposed navigation functions and establishes conditions under which the target is the unique minimum, addressing both disjoint and intersecting obstacles. Section\n4\npresents simulation results in representative convex 3-D environments, including workspaces with composite obstacle geometries. Section\n5\ndiscusses the topological representation of the base obstacles underlying the proposed constructions. Next, Section\n6\nextends the framework to spherical robots via a transformation to a point-mass-robot model and reports corresponding simulation results. Lastly, conclusions are presented in Section\n7\n.\n2  3-D Model Workspaces\nIn our motion planning problem, the robot operates in a 3-D model\nworkspace\n, meaning the point robot workspace is represented as an\nn\nn\n-dimensional ball of radius\nr\n0\nr_{0}\n, centered at the origin of\nE\nn\nE^{n}\n:\n𝒲\n≜\n{\nx\n→\n∈\nE\nn\n:\n‖\nx\n→\n‖\n2\n≤\nr\n0\n2\n}\nn\n=\n2\n,\n3\n.\n\\mathcal{W}\\triangleq\\{\\vec{x}\\in E^{n}:\\|\\vec{x}\\|^{2}\\leq r_{0}^{2}\\}\\quad n=2,3.\nThe focus of this work is on the case\nn\n=\n3\nn=3\n.\nObstacles within the workspace are defined as either\nspherical\nor\ncylindrical\nregions.

(b) Full cylinder. (c) Half cylinder capped by a hemisphere. (d) Finite cylinder capped by two hemispheres.\nIn this study, we consider three main types of obstacles:\n(i)\nspherical outer room walls\n,\n(ii)\nspherical obstacle\n(Fig.\n2\n(a)),\n(iii)\ncapped cylindrical obstacle\n, which consist of a finite cylinder, capped at both ends by hemispheres (Fig.\n2\n(d)).\nThe capped cylindrical obstacles can appear in three forms:\n(i)\nfull-cylinder obstacle\n, whose hemispherical caps lie outside of the workspace, causing the cylinder to intersect the room outer wall at two distinct regions (two anchors), as illustrated in Fig.\n2\n(b);\n(ii)\nhalf-cylinder obstacle\n, where only one hemispherical cap lies outside the workspace, resulting in a single intersection with the room’s outer wall (single anchor), as depicted in Fig.\n2\n(c);\n(iii)\nfinite-cylinder obstacle\n, where both hemispherical caps lie inside the workspace as shown in Fig.\n2\n(d).\nAll other obstacles are formed by unions of these basic obstacle types. An example of a composite obstacle, created by merging a spherical obstacle with three half-cylinder obstacles, is shown in Fig.\n3\n. Note that the black shell in Figs.\n2\nand\n3\nrepresents the outer walls of the spherical room. The spherical walls of a room with radius\nr\n0\nr_{0}\nare encoded by the following quadratic equation\nβ\n0\n​\n(\nx\n)\n=\nr\n0\n2\n−\n‖\nx\n‖\n2\nx\n∈\nℝ\n3\n\\beta_{0}(x)={r_{0}}^{2}-{\\|x\\|}^{2}\\quad x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}\n(1)\nSimilarly, spherical obstacles are encoded as\nβ\ni\n,\ns\n​\n(\nx\n)\n=\n‖\nx\n−\np\ni\n‖\n2\n−\nr\ni\n2\nx\n∈\nℝ\n3\n\\beta_{i,s}(x)=\\|x-p_{i}\\|^{2}-r_{i}^{2}\\quad x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}\n(2)\nwhere\nr\ni\nr_{i}\nis the sphere radius and\np\ni\np_{i}\nis the sphere center (Fig.\n2\n(a)). A full-cylindrical obstacle with two anchors (Fig.\n2\n(b)), encoded equation is defined as\nβ\ni\n,\nc\n=\n‖\nv\n^\ni\n×\n(\nx\n−\np\ni\n)\n‖\n2\n−\nr\ni\n2\n\\beta_{i,c}=\\|\\hat{v}_{i}\\times(x-p_{i})\\|^{2}-r_{i}^{2}\n(3)\nwhere\nv\n^\ni\n\\hat{v}_{i}\nis the unit direction vector of the main axis of the cylinder,\np\ni\np_{i}\nis a point along the axis and\nr\ni\nr_{i}\nis the radius of the cylinder (Fig.\n2\n(c)). Thus, we can encode a general capped cylinder as\nβ\ni\n,\nc\n​\nc\n​\n(\nx\n)\n=\n{\n‖\nv\n^\ni\n×\n(\nx\n−\np\ni\n,\n1\n)\n‖\n2\n−\nr\ni\n2\nif\n​\nv\n^\ni\nT\n​\n(\nx\n−\np\ni\n,\n1\n)\n⋅\nv\n^\ni\nT\n​\n(\nx\n−\np\ni\n,\n2\n)\n<\n0\n‖\n(\nx\n−\np\ni\n,\n1\n)\n‖\n2\n−\nr\ni\n2\nif\n​\nv\n^\ni\nT\n​\n(\nx\n−\np\ni\n,\n1\n)\n≤\n0\n​\nand\n​\nv\n^\ni\nT\n​\n(\nx\n−\np\ni\n,\n2\n)\n≤\n0\n‖\n(\nx\n−\np\ni\n,\n2\n)\n‖\n2\n−\nr\ni\n2\nif\n​\nv\n^\ni\nT\n​\n(\nx\n−\np\ni\n,\n1\n)\n≥\n0\n​\nand\n​\nv\n^\ni\nT\n​\n(\nx\n−\np\ni\n,\n2\n)\n≥\n0\n\\beta_{i,cc}(x)=\\begin{cases}\\|\\hat{v}_{i}\\times(x-{p}_{i,1})\\|^{2}-{r_{i}}^{2}&\\text{if }\\hat{v}_{i}^{T}(x-{p}_{i,1})\\cdot\\hat{v}_{i}^{T}(x-{p}_{i,2})<0\\\\\n\\|(x-{p}_{i,1})\\|^{2}-{r_{i}}^{2}&\\text{if }\\hat{v}_{i}^{T}(x-{p}_{i,1})\\leq 0\\text{ and }\\hat{v}_{i}^{T}(x-{p}_{i,2})\\leq 0\\\\\n\\|(x-{p}_{i,2})\\|^{2}-{r_{i}}^{2}&\\text{if }\\hat{v}_{i}^{T}(x-{p}_{i,1})\\geq 0\\text{ and }\\hat{v}_{i}^{T}(x-{p}_{i,2})\\geq 0\\\\\n\\end{cases}\n(4)\nHere,\np\ni\n,\n1\np_{i,1}\nand\np\ni\n,\n2\np_{i,2}\ndenote the endpoints of the cylinder,\nv\n^\ni\n\\hat{v}_{i}\nrepresents the cylinder axis direction, defined as\nv\n^\ni\n=\np\ni\n,\n2\n−\np\ni\n,\n1\n^\n\\hat{v}_{i}=\\widehat{p_{i,2}-p_{i,1}}\n, and\nr\ni\nr_{i}\nis the radius of both the cylinder and its hemispherical caps. The definition in Eq. (\n4\n) ensures that\nβ\ni\n,\nc\n​\nc\n\\beta_{i,cc}\nforms a continuously differentiable function (\nC\n1\nC^{1}\n). Note that a sphere can be defined as a capped-cylinder where\np\ni\n,\n1\n=\np\ni\n,\n2\n=\np\ni\np_{i,1}=p_{i,2}=p_{i}\n. However, for simplicity, we will treat them as separate obstacles.\nFigure 3:\nComposite obstacle consisting of pairwise unions between a spherical obstacle and three half-cylinder obstacles. The black shell represents the outer walls of the spherical room.\n2.1  Navigation Function Construction\nA\nnavigation function\nis a scalar-valued function,\nφ\n^\n:\nℱ\n→\n[\n0\n,\n1\n]\n\\hat{\\varphi}:\\mathcal{F}\\rightarrow[0,1]\n, that satisfies the following properties within a given free space:\n1.\nIt is smooth on an open set of\nℝ\nn\n\\mathbb{R}^{n}\nthat contains\nℱ\n\\mathcal{F}\n, where\nn\n=\n3\nn=3\nin our case.\n2.\nIt has a unique global minimum at the target,\np\nd\np_{d}\n, such that\nφ\n^\n​\n(\np\nd\n)\n=\n0\n\\hat{\\varphi}(p_{d})=0\n.\n3.\nAll its saddle points are non degenerate critical points in\nℱ\n\\mathcal{F}\n.\n4.\nIt is admissible, meaning that it is bounded and is uniformly maximal with value of 1 at the boundary of\nℱ\n\\mathcal{F}\n.\nBy leveraging the gradient of a navigation function,\n∇\nφ\n^\n​\n(\nx\n)\n\\nabla\\hat{\\varphi}(x)\n, a force-feedback controller can be designed to steer an omnidirectional point mass robot from almost any initial state to the target location.

However, this proof does not directly extend to the 3-D case due to the presence of non-spherical obstacles, such as cylinders. With slight modifications, the approach can be adapted for a 3-D setting. This section provides the necessary proof in the 3-D setting.\nLet\nϵ\n>\n0\n\\epsilon>0\ndefine an open neighborhood around the boundary of the free space\nℱ\n\\mathcal{F}\n, such that\nℬ\ni\n​\n(\nϵ\n)\n=\n{\nx\n→\n∈\nE\n3\n:\n0\n<\nβ\ni\n<\nϵ\n}\n\\mathcal{B}_{i}(\\epsilon)=\\{\\vec{x}\\in E^{3}:0<\\beta_{i}<\\epsilon\\}\n. Using this definition, we can partition the free space into five distinct subsets:\n1.\nThe destination point\n{\np\nd\n}\n;\n\\{p_{d}\\};\n2.\nThe boundary of the free space\n∂\nℱ\n≜\nβ\n−\n1\n​\n(\n0\n)\n;\n\\partial\\mathcal{F}\\triangleq\\beta^{-1}(0);\n3.\nThe region near the internal obstacles\nℱ\n0\n​\n(\nϵ\n)\n≜\n⋃\ni\n=\n1\nM\nℬ\ni\n​\n(\nϵ\n)\n−\n{\np\nd\n}\n;\n\\mathcal{F}_{0}(\\epsilon)\\triangleq\\bigcup_{i=1}^{M}\\mathcal{B}_{i}(\\epsilon)-\\{p_{d}\\};\n4.\nThe region near the workspace outer boundary\nℱ\n1\n​\n(\nϵ\n)\n≜\nℬ\n0\n​\n(\nϵ\n)\n−\n(\n{\np\nd\n}\n∪\nℱ\n0\n​\n(\nϵ\n)\n)\n;\n\\mathcal{F}_{1}(\\epsilon)\\triangleq\\mathcal{B}_{0}(\\epsilon)-\\left(\\{p_{d}\\}\\cup\\mathcal{F}_{0}(\\epsilon)\\right);\n5.\nThe region away from the obstacles\nℱ\n2\n​\n(\nϵ\n)\n≜\nℱ\n−\n(\n{\np\nd\n}\n∪\n∂\nℱ\n∪\nℱ\n0\n​\n(\nϵ\n)\n∪\nℱ\n1\n​\n(\nϵ\n)\n)\n;\n\\mathcal{F}_{2}(\\epsilon)\\triangleq\\mathcal{F}-\\left(\\{p_{d}\\}\\cup\\partial\\mathcal{F}\\cup\\mathcal{F}_{0}(\\epsilon)\\cup\\mathcal{F}_{1}(\\epsilon)\\right);\nFigure 4:\n2-D illustration of the five regions into which the free space is divided\nAn illustration of these regions is shown in Fig.\n4\n. We assume that\nϵ\n\\epsilon\nis sufficiently small so that the exclusion of\np\nd\np_{d}\nfrom both\nℱ\n0\n​\n(\nϵ\n)\n\\mathcal{F}_{0}(\\epsilon)\nand\nℱ\n1\n​\n(\nϵ\n)\n\\mathcal{F}_{1}(\\epsilon)\nis redundant, and that\nℱ\n0\n​\n(\nϵ\n)\n⊆\nℱ\n\\mathcal{F}_{0}(\\epsilon)\\subseteq\\mathcal{F}\n.\nOur polynomial navigation functions can be expressed as the ratio of two terms, thus, let us examine the gradient and Hessian of the general ratio function\nρ\n≜\nν\nδ\n\\rho\\triangleq\\frac{\\nu}{\\delta}\nAt a critical point, the gradient of this function satisfies\n∇\nρ\n=\n0\n→\n\\nabla\\rho=\\vec{0}\n. To determine the nature of the critical point, the Hessian\nD\n2\n​\nρ\nD^{2}\\rho\nis required. Specifically, a critical point is classified as a local minimum if all eigenvalues of the Hessian\nD\n2\n​\nρ\nD^{2}\\rho\nare positive. The gradient of such a navigation function can be written as:\n∇\nρ\n=\n1\nδ\n2\n​\n(\nδ\n​\n∇\nν\n−\nν\n​\n∇\nδ\n)\n\\nabla\\rho=\\frac{1}{\\delta^{2}}\\left(\\delta\\nabla\\nu-\\nu\\nabla\\delta\\right)\n(23)\nThus, the Hessian of\nρ\n\\rho\nis given by:\nD\n2\n​\nρ\n=\n1\nδ\n2\n​\n[\nδ\n​\nD\n2\n​\nν\n+\n∇\nν\n​\n∇\nδ\nT\n−\n∇\nδ\n​\n∇\nν\nT\n−\nν\n​\nD\n2\n​\nδ\n]\n+\nδ\n2\n​\n∇\nρ\n​\n(\n∇\n1\nδ\n2\n)\nT\nD^{2}\\rho=\\frac{1}{\\delta^{2}}[\\delta D^{2}\\nu+\\nabla\\nu\\nabla\\delta^{T}-\\nabla\\delta\\nabla\\nu^{T}-\\nu D^{2}\\delta]+\\delta^{2}\\nabla\\rho\\left(\\nabla\\frac{1}{\\delta^{2}}\\right)^{T}\n(24)\nSince at the critical point\n∇\nρ\n=\n0\n→\n\\nabla\\rho=\\vec{0}\n, it follows from Eq. (\n23\n) that\n∇\nν\n=\nρ\n​\n∇\nδ\n\\nabla\\nu=\\rho\\nabla\\delta\n. Therefore, the Hessian at a critical point simplifies to:\nD\n2\n​\nρ\n|\n𝒞\np\n=\n1\nδ\n2\n​\n[\nδ\n​\nD\n2\n​\nν\n−\nν\n​\nD\n2\n​\nδ\n]\nD^{2}\\rho|\\mathcal{C}_{p}=\\frac{1}{\\delta^{2}}[\\delta D^{2}\\nu-\\nu D^{2}\\delta]\n(25)\nNow, let us show that our functions are valid navigation functions by evaluating the critical points. As demonstrated in\n[\n9\n]\n, composing the navigation function\nφ\n^\n\\hat{\\varphi}\nwith a monotonic function does not alter the location or type of critical points. Consequently, substituting different navigation functions in various parts of this proof remains valid.\n3.1  Destination and Boundary of\nℱ\n\\mathcal{F}\nIn this section, we demonstrate that\nφ\n\\varphi\nattains a global minimum at the target. Additionally, we analyze the critical points of\nφ\n\\varphi\nalong the boundary of the free space,\n∂\nℱ\n\\partial\\mathcal{F}\n.\nClaim 3.1\n.\nFor a valid workspace\n𝒲\n\\mathcal{W}\n, the destination point,\np\nd\np_{d}\nis a non-degenerate local minimum of\nφ\n\\varphi\n.\nProof.\nEvaluating\nφ\n\\varphi\nat\np\nd\np_{d}\nusing\n∇\nφ\n\\nabla\\varphi\nand\nD\n2\n​\nφ\nD^{2}\\varphi\nconfirms the existence of a non-degenerate local minimum at the destination.\n∎\nWe can distinguish between three different spatial relationships between two obstacles: (i) disjoint obstacles, (ii) tangent obstacles, and (iii) intersecting obstacles. Disjoint obstacles, as illustrated in Fig.\n5\n(a), do not share any common points. Tangent obstacles, shown in Fig.\n5\n(b), touch at exactly one point. This is also true in a 3-D setting, except for parallel cylinders, where the tangent forms a line parallel to the main axis of the cylinders. Intersecting obstacles, illustrated in Fig.\n5\n(c), share multiple intersection points. In 3D, the intersection between two obstacles forms a closed curve, except in the case of two parallel cylinders, where the intersection is represented by two parallel lines.\nFigure 5:\nSpatial relationships between two 2-D disc obstacles. (a) Disjoint obstacles. (b) Tangent obstacles with a single shared point. (c) Intersecting obstacles with two intersection points.\nClaim 3.2\n.\nFor a valid workspace\n𝒲\n\\mathcal{W}\nwith no tangent obstacles, all critical points of\nφ\n\\varphi\nare in the interior of\nℱ\n\\mathcal{F}\n.\nProof.\nThe gradient of\nφ\n\\varphi\nat a point\np\n0\n∈\n∂\nℱ\np_{0}\\in\\partial\\mathcal{F}\n, where\nβ\ni\n​\n(\np\n0\n)\n=\n0\n\\beta_{i}(p_{0})=0\n, is given by:\n∇\nφ\n​\n(\np\n0\n)\n\\displaystyle\\nabla\\varphi(p_{0})\n=\n1\n(\nγ\nd\nk\n+\nβ\n)\n2\nk\n(\n(\nγ\nd\nk\n+\nβ\n)\n1\nk\n∇\nγ\nd\n−\nγ\nd\n∇\n(\nγ\nd\nk\n+\nβ\n)\n1\nk\n)\n|\np\n0\n\\displaystyle=\\frac{1}{({\\gamma_{d}}^{k}+\\beta)^{\\frac{2}{k}}}\\left(({\\gamma_{d}}^{k}+\\beta)^{\\frac{1}{k}}\\nabla\\gamma_{d}-\\gamma_{d}\\nabla({\\gamma_{d}}^{k}+\\beta)^{\\frac{1}{k}}\\right)|_{p_{0}}\n=\n−\n1\nk\n​\nγ\nd\n−\nk\n​\n(\n∏\nj\n=\n0\nj\n≠\ni\nM\nβ\nj\n)\n​\n∇\nβ\ni\n.\n\\displaystyle=-\\frac{1}{k}{\\gamma_{d}}^{-k}\\left(\\prod_{\\begin{subarray}{c}j=0\\\\\nj\\neq i\\end{subarray}}^{M}\\beta_{j}\\right)\\nabla\\beta_{i}.\nIt is evident that for disjoint obstacles,\n∇\nφ\n​\n(\np\n0\n)\n≠\n0\n\\nabla\\varphi(p_{0})\\neq 0\n.\nHowever, in the case of two tangent or intersecting obstacles, where\nβ\ni\n​\n(\np\n0\n)\n=\nβ\nk\n​\n(\np\n0\n)\n=\n0\n\\beta_{i}(p_{0})=\\beta_{k}(p_{0})=0\n, the gradient along the intersection curve satisfies\n∇\nφ\n​\n(\np\n0\n)\n=\n0\n→\n\\nabla\\varphi(p_{0})=\\vec{0}\n, causing these critical points to appear as a curve of local maxima. This issue can be addressed by merging both obstacles using the\np\n-Rvachev function\n[\n25\n]\n:\nβ\ni\n​\nk\n=\nR\np\n​\n(\nβ\ni\n,\nβ\nk\n)\n=\nβ\ni\n+\nβ\nk\n−\n(\nβ\ni\np\n+\nβ\nk\np\n)\n1\np\np\n>\n1\n\\beta_{ik}=R_{p}(\\beta_{i},\\beta_{k})=\\beta_{i}+\\beta_{k}-\\left(\\beta_{i}^{p}+\\beta_{k}^{p}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}}\\quad p>1\nFigure 6:\nβ\ni\n​\nk\n\\beta_{ik}\nvalue for intersecting 2-D obstacles.

An example for both separate and merged obstacles are shown in Fig.\n6\n(a) and Fig.\n6\n(b).

Fig.\n7\nillustrates different types of allowed obstacle intersections, with the intersection curves highlighted in blue. In Fig.\n7\n(a), two intersecting spheres form a circular intersection curve. Fig.\n7\n(b) depicts the intersection between a sphere and a cylinder, where the intersection curve takes the shape of an arched ellipse. Fig.\n7\n(c) shows two intersecting perpendicular cylinders, producing two planar elliptical intersection curves (Steinmetz curve\n[\n26\n]\n). For simplicity, in addition to the constraint of perpendicular cylinders, we also demand that both cylinders have equal radii and that their axes intersect. Lastly, Fig.\n7\n(d) depicts the intersection of a half-cylinder with a sphere. Note that when the center of the sphere lies on the cylinder’s axis the intersection curve is a perpendicular slice of the cylinder.\nWhile most of the proofs from previous sections remain valid in this scenario, it is necessary to re-evaluate the constraint on\nϵ\n0\n\\epsilon_{0}\nto ensure that no local minima appear near the intersection. Let us first examine the case of intersecting cylinders. Consider the line passing through the intersection of both axes and perpendicular to\nv\n^\ni\n\\hat{v}_{i}\nand\nv\n^\nj\n\\hat{v}_{j}\n. On this line, we have\n∇\nβ\ni\n∥\n∇\nβ\nj\n\\nabla\\beta_{i}\\parallel\\nabla\\beta_{j}\n.

Consequently, at a triple intersection point no valid escape direction exists and local minima may form in these regions. A formal proof is shown in\n[\n22\n]\n. Therefore, triple intersections are\nnot\npermitted in our workspace.\n∘\n\\circ\nWhile our 3-D model workspace does not admit triple intersections. they can be handled using coordinate transformation or workspace decomposition in future work.\nFigure 10:\nIllustration of three intersecting spherical obstacles. (a) Two separate intersections. (b) A triple intersection. The blue curves represent the pairwise intersections of two spheres, while the green points indicate the triple intersection, which resides in a concave region.\n4  Simulated Environments\nThis section evaluates the effectiveness of our navigation functions through simulations. Section\n4.1\nsimulates a general workspace with ten randomly placed internal obstacles.

(a) For tuning parameter\nk\n=\n9\nk=9\n, three initial points converge to local minima. (b) For tuning parameter\nk\n=\n11\nk=11\n, all evaluated initial points successfully reach the destination.\nFigure 12:\nNavigation function value over time for tuning parameter\nk\n=\n11\nk=11\n. (a) values for\nψ\n\\psi\n. (b) values for\nφ\n\\varphi\n.\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of the navigation functions, we conducted simulations in ten distinct workspaces. Each workspace, was defined with a radius of\nr\n0\n=\n5\n​\nm\nr_{0}=5~m\nand contains ten randomly placed internal obstacles from the catalog defined in Section\n2.2\n. Note that obstacles may be either disjoint or pairwise intersecting, as specified in Section\n3.3\n.\nFor each workspace we performed ten simulations, each with a different destination point, resulting in a total of 100 simulations. In each workspace, 15 initial points were randomly selected. Each destination point was assessed by navigating from these 15 initial points to the target.\nThe robot’s control law was defined as\nx\n¨\n=\n−\n∇\nλ\n​\n(\nx\n)\n−\nc\n​\nx\n˙\n\\ddot{x}=-\\nabla\\lambda(x)-c\\dot{x}\n(47)\nwhere\nλ\n\\lambda\nis the navigation function (\nφ\n\\varphi\nor\nψ\n\\psi\n),\nx\nx\nrepresents the robot’s position, and\nc\nc\nis the damping coefficient.\nFigure 13:\nTrajectories for simulation of a truss obstacle for 100 initial positions and common target at\nP\nd\n=\n(\n0\n,\n0\n,\n0\n)\nP_{d}=(0,0,0)\n.\nAn example simulation result for the\nψ\n\\psi\nfunction with\nk\n=\n9\nk=9\nand\nc\n=\n0.6\nc=0.6\nis presented in Fig.\n11\n(a). The results for the same workspace with\nk\n=\n11\nk=11\nare shown in Fig.\n11\n(b). It is evident that for\nk\n=\n9\nk=9\n, the destination was not reached for three initial positions, as the robot converged to a local minimum. In contrast, for\nk\n=\n11\nk=11\n, all evaluated initial positions successfully reached the destination. The evolution of the navigation function values over time for the simulation in Fig.\n11\n(b) is depicted in Fig.\n12\n.\nIt is evident that for the\nψ\n\\psi\nfunction, the destination is reached relatively quickly (within 80 seconds for all initial positions), as shown in Fig.\n12\n(a). In contrast, for the\nφ\n\\varphi\nfunction, the navigation time for some initial positions can exceed 900 seconds, as depicted in Fig.\n12\n(b). This behavior can be explained by the structure of the functions. Assuming\nγ\nd\n>\n1\n\\gamma_{d}>1\n, we can consider the following limits:\nlim\nk\n→\n∞\nφ\n=\nγ\nd\n(\nγ\nd\nk\n+\nβ\n)\n1\n/\nk\n→\nk\n→\n∞\n1\n\\displaystyle\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}\\varphi=\\frac{\\gamma_{d}}{({\\gamma_{d}}^{k}+\\beta)^{1/k}}\\xrightarrow[k\\to\\infty]{}1\nlim\nk\n→\n∞\nψ\n=\nγ\nd\nγ\nd\n+\nβ\n1\n/\nk\n→\nk\n→\n∞\nγ\nd\nγ\nd\n+\n1\n\\displaystyle\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}\\psi=\\frac{\\gamma_{d}}{{\\gamma_{d}}+\\beta^{1/k}}\\xrightarrow[k\\to\\infty]{}\\frac{\\gamma_{d}}{{\\gamma_{d}}+1}\nIt is evident that increasing\nk\nk\nflattens\nφ\n\\varphi\n, whereas\nψ\n\\psi\nretains its convex shape as\nk\nk\nincreases. Consequently, when the initial state lies in a near-flat region where\nφ\n≈\n1\n\\varphi\\approx 1\n, the robot drifts slowly until it exits this plateau. In environments with a large number of obstacles, larger values of\nk\nk\nare required to prevent local minima, further limiting the effectiveness of\nφ\n\\varphi\n. Although normalizing the dimensions of the workspace to\nr\n0\n=\n0.5\nr_{0}=0.5\ncould mitigate this issue, we will focus exclusively on the function\nψ\n\\psi\nin future evaluations.\n4.2  Composite Truss Obstacle\nFigure 14:\nPosition of the robot along the trajectory for the truss obstacle simulation. (a) X-coordinate, (b) Y-coordinate and (c) Z-coordinate.\nFigure 15:\nVelocity of the robot along the trajectory for the truss obstacle simulation. (a) X-coordinate, (b) Y-coordinate and (c) Z-coordinate.\nFigure 16:\nAcceleration of the robot along the trajectory for the truss obstacle simulation. (a) X-coordinate, (b) Y-coordinate and (c) Z-coordinate.\nTo construct the truss obstacle depicted in Fig.\n13\n, we used 36 base obstacles of spheres, half-cylinders, and finite cylinders. The tuning parameter was set to\nk\n=\n40\nk=40\nwith a damping coefficient of\nc\n=\n0.6\nc=0.6\n. The simulation was conducted for 100 initial positions near the workspace boundary with a common target point at\nP\nd\n=\n(\n0\n,\n0\n,\n0\n)\nP_{d}=(0,0,0)\n. The resulting trajectories of the dynamic system (\n47\n) are shown in Fig.\n13\n. The position, velocity, and acceleration along these trajectories are depicted in Figs.\n14\nthrough\n16\n. Notably, the velocity remained below 0.4\nm\n/\ns\nm/s\n, while the acceleration did not exceed 0.24\nm\n/\ns\n2\nm/s^{2}\nat all times along the trajectories.\nComposite obstacles:\nAlthough this obstacle construction method enables straightforward coordinate transformations between the physical world and the 3-D model workspace, it often results in environments containing a large number of obstacles. Consequently, a high tuning parameter\nk\nk\nis required to mitigate the risk of local minima. However, the number of internal obstacles can be artificially reduced by merging intersecting obstacles using Rvachev functions\n[\n25\n]\n, which can help relax the constraint on\nk\nk\n, as illustrated in Fig.\n17\n. Fig.\n17\n(a) shows that, for the Truss obstacle with\nk\n=\n10\nk=10\nand no merging of the base obstacle, all initial positions converge to parasitic local minima. In contrast, Fig.\n17\n(b) demonstrates that after merging all 36 base obstacles into a single composite obstacle, the target is successfully reached from all initial positions. However, it is important to note that merging obstacles may increase the trajectory computation time of the robot’s onboard computer.\nTo assess the impact of base obstacle merging in a workspace composed of disjoint obstacles, we re-simulated the scenario from Fig.\n11\nusing the merging method. Recall that in Fig.\n11\n, all ten obstacles were disjoint. The target in Fig.\n11\nwas reached for all evaluated initial positions only when\nk\n>\n9\nk>9\n. After merging only intersecting obstacles, reducing the total obstacle count from ten to seven, this requirement was relaxed to\nk\n>\n4\nk>4\nas shown in Fig.\n18\n(a). Furthermore, when applying the\np\n-Rvachev function to construct a disjoint union of all internal obstacles in Fig.\n11\n, the target was successfully reached even for\nk\n=\n2\nk=2\n, as illustrated in Fig.\n18\n(b). This improvement may stem from the relaxation of the lower bound on\nk\nk\ndescribed in Eq. (\n28\n). By reducing the number of obstacles, the term\n∑\ni\n=\n0\nM\nmax\n𝒲\n⁡\n{\n‖\n∇\nβ\ni\n‖\n}\n\\sum_{i=0}^{M}\\max_{\\mathcal{W}}\\{\\|\\nabla\\beta_{i}\\|\\}\ndecreases accordingly, which in turn lowers the theoretical lower bound required for\nk\nk\n.\nFigure 17:\nSimulation of the truss obstacle with\nk\n=\n10\nk=10\nfor 100 initial positions and a common target at\nP\nd\n=\n(\n0\n,\n0\n,\n0\n)\nP_{d}=(0,0,0)\n. (a) Without merging the base obstacles, all trajectories converge to a parasitic local minimum. (b) After merging all base obstacles into a single composite obstacle using the\np\n-Rvachev function, all initial positions successfully reach the target.\nFigure 18:\nSimulation of a workspace containing ten distinct obstacles. (a) The number of obstacles is reduced to seven by merging only intersecting obstacles; tuning parameter\nk\n=\n5\nk=5\nis used. (b) All obstacles are merged into a single obstacle; tuning parameter\nk\n=\n2\nk=2\nis used.\n5  Topological Representation of Base Obstacles\nFigure 19:\nIllustration of a homeomorphism between a physical environment and a 3-D model workspace. (a) A physical environment consisting of two rooms separated by a wall with a door and two windows. (b) A homeomorphic version of the environment, where the openings in the wall have been expanded. (c) A 3-D model workspace representing the homeomorphic environment. (d) Illustration showing that the environment is homeomorphic to the interior of a two-hole torus.\nIn this section, we show via a concrete example that almost any 3-D physical workspace has a homeomorphic counterpart in the 3-D model space, enabling the construction of a coordinate transformation between the two. As illustrated in Fig.\n19\n(a), we start with a physical environment where two rooms are separated by a wall containing a door and two windows. In Fig.\n19\n(b) the door and windows are expanded without altering the room’s topological structure. As depicted in Fig.\n19\n(c), the separating wall can now be topologically deformed into an internal obstacle composed of a horizontal full cylinder and a vertical half-cylinder, maintaining the three openings between the two rooms. Notably, this model environment is homeomorphic to the\ninterior\nof a\ntwo-hole torus\n, as illustrated in Fig.\n19\n(d).\nIt is important to note that while we previously used a sphere as the outer boundary of the workspace, the only requirement is that the boundary remains a convex enclosure. Therefore, to simplify the transformation, the outer boundary does not need to be modified in this case. This is further demonstrated in Fig.\n20\n, where the simulation of the truss obstacle from Section\n4.2\n, originally conducted in a spherical room, is repeated for a cubic room.\nFigure 20:\nPoint-mass robot trajectories for a truss obstacle in a cubic room for 100 initial positions and common target at\nP\nd\n=\n(\n0\n,\n0\n,\n0\n)\nP_{d}=(0,0,0)\nand tuning parameter\nk\n=\n40\nk=40\n(due to 36 base obstacles).\n6  Spherical Robot Navigation\nThis section evaluates the navigation of a spherical robot in the 3-D model space. Section\n6.1\npresents the transformation from the spherical robot to a point robot. Section\n6.2\nsimulates the navigation of a spherical robot.\n6.1  Transformation to Point Robot\nFigure 21:\n2-D projection of the transformation from spherical robot to point robot for disjoint obstacles: (a) Spherical obstacle. (b) Finite cylindrical obstacle.\nFigure 22:\n2-D projection of the transformation from spherical robot to point robot for pairwise intersecting obstacles. (a) Intersecting spherical obstacles or sphere and cylinder intersection. (b) Intersection of cylindrical obstacles.\nFigure 23:\n2-D projection of the transformation from spherical robot to point robot for (a) Closely spaced spherical obstacles or sphere and cylinder obstacles, and (b) Closely spaced cylindrical obstacles.\nFigure 24:\nIllustration of the transformation from spherical robot to point robot for obstacle clusters. (a) 2-D projection of the transformation for three closely spaced spherical obstacles. (b) Triple intersection point for a spherical robot shown in the original 3-D model space.\nUp to this point, we have demonstrated the safe motion planning for a\npoint-mass robot\nwithin a 3-D model workspace. In this section, we show that a given 3-D model space with a spherical robot can be transformed into an equivalent 3-D model space for a point-mass robot in an obstacle environment.\nThe spherical-to-point robot transformation shifts the workspace boundary to represent the locus of the spherical robot\ncenters\nfor configurations at which the spherical robot is in contact with the original boundary. This approach effectively shrinks the spherical robot to a point located at its center while expanding the surrounding obstacles by the radius of the spherical robot. As shown in Fig.\n21\n(a)-(b) for a spherical and a finite cylindrical obstacle, a robot of radius\nR\nR\nresults in the radius of each internal obstacle increasing to\nr\ni\n′\n=\nr\ni\n+\nR\nr_{i}^{\\prime}=r_{i}+R\n. Similarly, the boundary of the workspace contracts uniformly, yielding\nr\n0\n′\n=\nr\n0\n−\nR\nr_{0}^{\\prime}=r_{0}-R\n.\nSimilarly, Fig.\n22\nillustrates the spherical-to-point robot transformation in the case of intersecting obstacles. Fig.\n22\n(a) shows the transformation for two intersecting spherical obstacles (or between a sphere and a cylinder), while Fig.\n22\n(b) shows the case of intersecting finite cylinders. It can be observed that, for allowed obstacle intersections as described in Section\n3.3\n, the transformation preserves the validity of the intersection, thus preserving the original 3-D model space construction. However, in the case of a ball joint, slight modifications are required, as will be discussed later in this section.\nClosely spaced obstacle pair:\nConsider the case where the distance between two obstacles is less than\n2\n​\nR\n2R\n, as illustrated in Fig.\n23\n. In this case, the spherical robot may simultaneously contact both obstacles in certain configurations. Fig.\n23\n(a) shows the transformation for closely spaced spherical obstacles (or a sphere and a cylinder), while Fig.\n23\n(b) illustrates the case for closely spaced cylinders that do not meet at a ball joint. While close proximity between two spherical obstacles or between a sphere and a cylinder results in an allowed intersection, closely spaced cylinders\ndo not\nyield an allowed 3-D model space. For instance, Fig.\n23\n(b) shows two 3-D expanded cylinders that form a pairwise intersection which is\nnot\nallowed by the 3-D model space. Consequently, in a\nspherical-robot 3-D model space\n, the distance between any two cylinders that do not meet at a ball joint, must be at least\n2\n​\nR\n2R\n. However, this constraint can be circumvented by using coordinate transformations or by introducing an additional ball joint obstacle that encloses the intersection curves of the cylinders in the\npoint-robot workspace\nsimilarly to the truss obstacle in Fig.\n13\n.\nObstacle clusters:\nConsider the case of three or more obstacles where the distance between any two obstacles in the cluster is less than\n2\n​\nR\n2R\n, as shown in Fig.\n24\n(a). In such cases, there may be a configuration where the spherical robot is simultaneously touching three obstacles, as demonstrated in Fig.\n24\n(b), resulting in a triple intersection point in the point-robot workspace. Thus, except at the ball joints which form admissible obstacle clusters, the spherical-robot 3-D model space does not permit these clusters.\nFigure 25:\n2-D projection of the transformation from spherical robot to point robot at a ball joint. (a) All obstacles are expanded by\nR\nR\nresulting in the intersection of the cylindrical obstacles escaping the expanded ball joint. (b) A proper expansion of the ball joint where the intersection of the cylindrical obstacles remains inside the sphere.\nBall joint:\nWe define a\nball joint\nas the intersection of two or more finite cylindrical obstacles enclosed within a sphere, as illustrated by the corners of the truss obstacle in Fig.\n13\n. Since the intersection curve of the cylinders may lie arbitrarily close to the surface of the ball joint, the following transformation ensures that the entire intersection remains fully contained within the expanded ball joint obstacle when transforming to the point robot workspace:\nr\ncylinder\n′\n=\nr\ncylinder\n+\nR\n\\displaystyle r_{\\text{cylinder}}^{\\prime}=r_{\\text{cylinder}}+R\n(48)\nr\nball-joint\n′\n=\nr\nball-joint\n+\nR\nsin\n⁡\n(\nθ\n/\n2\n)\n\\displaystyle r_{\\text{ball-joint}}^{\\prime}=r_{\\text{ball-joint}}+\\frac{R}{\\sin(\\theta/2)}\n(49)\nwhere\nθ\n\\theta\ndenotes the angle between the axes of two intersecting cylinders. For joints involving more than two cylinders,\nθ\n\\theta\nis defined as the minimum angle between any pair of cylinder axes:\nθ\n=\nmin\ni\n≠\nj\n⁡\n{\narcsin\n⁡\n(\n‖\nv\n^\ni\n×\nv\n^\nj\n‖\n)\n}\n.\n\\theta=\\min_{i\\neq j}\\left\\{\\arcsin\\left(\\|\\hat{v}_{i}\\times\\hat{v}_{j}\\|\\right)\\right\\}.\nSmaller values of\nθ\n\\theta\nrequire a larger expansion of the ball joint to fully enclose the worst-case intersection curve of the cylinders. The additional expansion beyond the physical offset\nR\nR\nis given by:\nΔ\n=\nR\nsin\n⁡\n(\nθ\n/\n2\n)\n−\nR\n=\n(\n1\nsin\n⁡\n(\nθ\n/\n2\n)\n−\n1\n)\n⋅\nR\n.\n\\Delta=\\frac{R}{\\sin(\\theta/2)}-R=\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sin(\\theta/2)}-1\\right)\\cdot R.\nFor perpendicular cylinders, this additional expansion is approximately\n40\n%\n40\\%\n(\nR\n/\nsin\n⁡\n(\n45\n∘\n)\n−\nR\n≅\n0.4\n​\nR\nR/\\sin(45^{\\circ})-R\\cong 0.4R\n). However, when\nR\n≪\nr\nball-joint\nR\\ll r_{\\text{ball-joint}}\n, this increase is negligible. The main limitation of the fully enclosed expansion method is that it restricts the placement of a closely spaced obstacle pair within a distance of\n(\n1\nsin\n⁡\n(\nθ\n/\n2\n)\n+\n1\n)\n​\nR\n\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sin(\\theta/2)}+1\\right)R\nfrom the ball joint, compared to the standard\n2\n​\nR\n2R\nclearance for regularly expanded obstacles, as this proximity could lead to unintended triple intersections.\nAn incorrect transformation where the intersection of two expanded cylinders escapes the ball joint resulting in a triple intersection point is illustrated in Fig.\n25\n(a), while the correct transformation is depicted in Fig.\n25\n(b).\nBall joint radius analysis:\nWhile the previously described method for determining the radius of a ball joint is straightforward, it imposes a significant constraint on the available free space. This limitation can be alleviated by further analyzing the triple intersection formed by the the protrusion of the cylinders intersection curve from the sphere, as depicted in Fig.\n26\n(a). It is evident from Fig.\n26\n(a) that the triple intersection does not produce a concave region, and a potential escape direction lies along the pairwise intersection curve of the cylinders.\nFigure 26:\nIllustration of a ball joint exhibiting a triple intersection point. (a) The ball joint configuration, with the elliptical intersection curve between the cylinders highlighted in blue. (b) Geometric analysis of the intersection curve, showing the evolute of the ellipse in red and the minimal enclosing ball joint in black.\nRecall that the intersection curve between two cylinders of equal radii and intersecting axes forms a planar ellipse. Furthermore, for there to be a test direction along a planar intersection curve, it is sufficient that the curve’s evolute lies entirely within the curve itself. Thus, to ensure that the transformed ball joint has an escape direction, we must verify that the evolute of the intersection arc protruding from the ball joint is enclosed by the elliptical intersection curve.\nWe begin by expressing the major and minor axes of the ellipse, along with the expansion factor, as follows:\na\n=\nr\ncylinder\n+\nR\nsin\n⁡\n(\nθ\n/\n2\n)\n=\nh\n⋅\nb\n\\displaystyle a=\\frac{r_{\\text{cylinder}}+R}{\\sin(\\theta/2)}=h\\cdot b\nb\n=\nr\ncylinder\n+\nR\n\\displaystyle b=r_{\\text{cylinder}}+R\nh\n=\n1\nsin\n⁡\n(\nθ\n/\n2\n)\n\\displaystyle h=\\frac{1}{\\sin(\\theta/2)}\nThe parameterized form of the elliptical curve is\nτ\n​\n(\nϕ\n)\n=\n(\na\n​\ncos\n⁡\n(\nϕ\n)\nb\n​\nsin\n⁡\n(\nϕ\n)\n)\n\\tau(\\phi)=\\begin{pmatrix}a\\cos(\\phi)\\\\\nb\\sin(\\phi)\\end{pmatrix}\n(50)\nIts radius of curvature at a given\nϕ\n\\phi\nis\nρ\n​\n(\nϕ\n)\n=\n(\na\n2\n​\nsin\n2\n⁡\n(\nϕ\n)\n+\nb\n2\n​\ncos\n2\n⁡\n(\nϕ\n)\n)\n3\n/\n2\na\n​\nb\n\\rho(\\phi)=\\frac{\\left(a^{2}\\sin^{2}(\\phi)+b^{2}\\cos^{2}(\\phi)\\right)^{3/2}}{ab}\n(51)\nwhile its inward normal vector at the same point is\nN\n​\n(\nϕ\n)\n=\n1\na\n2\n​\nsin\n2\n⁡\n(\nϕ\n)\n+\nb\n2\n​\ncos\n2\n⁡\n(\nϕ\n)\n​\n(\n−\nb\n​\ncos\n⁡\n(\nϕ\n)\n−\na\n​\nsin\n⁡\n(\nϕ\n)\n)\nN(\\phi)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a^{2}\\sin^{2}(\\phi)+b^{2}\\cos^{2}(\\phi)}}\\begin{pmatrix}-b\\cos(\\phi)\\\\\n-a\\sin(\\phi)\\end{pmatrix}\n(52)\nUsing Eqs. (\n50\n)–(\n52\n), we can derive the center of curvature as\nC\n​\n(\nϕ\n)\n=\nτ\n​\n(\nϕ\n)\n+\nρ\n​\n(\nϕ\n)\n⋅\nN\n​\n(\nϕ\n)\n=\n(\n(\na\n2\n−\nb\n2\n)\n​\ncos\n3\n⁡\n(\nϕ\n)\na\n(\nb\n2\n−\na\n2\n)\n​\nsin\n3\n⁡\n(\nϕ\n)\nb\n)\n=\n(\nC\nx\nC\ny\n)\nC(\\phi)=\\tau(\\phi)+\\rho(\\phi)\\cdot N(\\phi)=\\begin{pmatrix}\\frac{(a^{2}-b^{2})\\cos^{3}(\\phi)}{a}\\\\\n\\frac{(b^{2}-a^{2})\\sin^{3}(\\phi)}{b}\\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix}C_{x}\\\\\nC_{y}\\end{pmatrix}\n(53)\nFigure 27:\nComparison of the two methods for determining the expanded radius of a ball joint. The full enclosure of the intersection curve is shown in blue, while the minimal sphere method is depicted in orange. Lower expansion of the ball joint means less free space is occupied by the expanded ball joint.\nNow using the implicit representation of the ellipse we can find the point where the evolute intersects the ellipse\nC\nx\n2\na\n2\n+\nC\ny\n2\nb\n2\n=\n(\na\n2\n−\nb\n2\n)\n2\n​\ncos\n6\n⁡\n(\nϕ\n)\na\n4\n+\n(\na\n2\n−\nb\n2\n)\n2\n​\nsin\n6\n⁡\n(\nϕ\n)\nb\n4\n=\n1\n\\frac{C_{x}^{2}}{a^{2}}+\\frac{C_{y}^{2}}{b^{2}}=\\frac{(a^{2}-b^{2})^{2}\\cos^{6}(\\phi)}{a^{4}}+\\frac{(a^{2}-b^{2})^{2}\\sin^{6}(\\phi)}{b^{4}}=1\n(54)\nSubstituting\ncos\n2\n⁡\n(\nϕ\n)\n=\n1\n−\nsin\n2\n⁡\n(\nϕ\n)\n=\n1\n−\nx\n\\cos^{2}(\\phi)=1-\\sin^{2}(\\phi)=1-x\nand\na\n=\nh\n⋅\nb\na=h\\cdot b\ninto Eq. (\n54\n), we obtain the following cubic equation in\nx\nx\n:\n(\nh\n4\n−\n1\n)\n​\nx\n3\n+\n3\n​\nx\n2\n−\n3\n​\nx\n+\n(\n1\n−\nh\n4\n(\nh\n2\n−\n1\n)\n2\n)\n=\n0\n(h^{4}-1)x^{3}+3x^{2}-3x+\\left(1-\\frac{h^{4}}{(h^{2}-1)^{2}}\\right)=0\n(55)\nSolving this equation yields a single real positive root at\nx\n=\n2\n​\nh\n2\n−\n1\nh\n4\n−\n1\n=\nsin\n2\n⁡\n(\nθ\n/\n2\n)\n​\n(\n2\n−\nsin\n2\n⁡\n(\nθ\n/\n2\n)\n)\n1\n−\nsin\n4\n⁡\n(\nθ\n/\n2\n)\nx=\\frac{2h^{2}-1}{h^{4}-1}=\\frac{\\sin^{2}(\\theta/2)\\left(2-\\sin^{2}(\\theta/2)\\right)}{1-\\sin^{4}(\\theta/2)}\nThis value of\nx\nx\ncorresponds to the squared sine of the angle\nϕ\nk\n\\phi_{k}\nwhere the evolute first intersects the ellipse.

The blue curve represents the complete enclosure of the intersection (Eq. (\n49\n)), while the orange curve corresponds to the minimal ball joint method (Eq. (\n56\n)). Notably, for\nθ\n≥\n90\n∘\n\\theta\\geq 90^{\\circ}\nbetween adjacent cylinders at a ball joint, the expansion factor in the minimal radius method falls below one, indicating that the required ball joint radius is smaller than that of the cylinders. As a result, the inclusion of a ball joint joint is unnecessary in such configurations.\nProbability of successful navigation:\nBoth workspace transformations involve expanding the ball joint\nbeyond\nthe radius of the spherical robot. Hence, there exists non-zero probability that the point-robot’s initial position falls within this expanded region. Note that the ball joint expansion occupies a small portion of the spherical robot free space. In such cases, the point-mass robot would fail to reach the target since navigation cannot be initiated from within an internal obstacle. Assuming the point-robot initial position is uniformly distributed along the boundary of the workspace, the probability of failure can be expressed as\nP\ns\n​\n(\nfailure\n)\n≤\n1\n−\nS\n−\n4\n​\nπ\n​\n∑\ni\n(\nr\nb\n​\nj\n,\ni\n′\n)\n2\nS\n\\text{P}_{\\text{s}}(\\text{failure})\\leq 1-\\frac{S-4\\pi\\sum_{i}(r_{bj,i}^{\\prime})^{2}}{S}\nwhere\nS\nS\ndenotes the surface area of the workspace boundary after the expansion of all internal obstacles by the spherical robot radius\nR\nR\n, and\nr\nb\n​\nj\n,\ni\n′\nr_{bj,i}^{\\prime}\nrepresents the radius of the\ni\ni\n-th expanded ball joint after expansion by the radius spherical robot.\nAlternatively, if the initial position is uniformly distributed throughout the free space, the failure probability is given by\nP\nv\n​\n(\nfailure\n)\n≤\n1\n−\nV\n−\n4\n3\n​\nπ\n​\n∑\ni\n(\n(\nr\nb\n​\nj\n,\ni\n+\nh\ni\n​\nR\n)\n3\n−\n(\nr\nb\n​\nj\n,\ni\n+\nR\n)\n3\n)\nV\n\\text{P}_{\\text{v}}(\\text{failure})\\leq 1-\\frac{V-\\frac{4}{3}\\pi\\sum_{i}{\\left((r_{bj,i}+h_{i}R)^{3}-(r_{bj,i}+R)^{3}\\right)}}{V}\nwhere\nV\nV\nis the total volume of the free space under standard expansion,\nr\nb\n​\nj\n,\ni\nr_{bj,i}\nis the original radius (pre-expansion) of the\ni\ni\n-th ball joint and\nh\ni\nh_{i}\nis the expansion factor of the ball joint. It is important to note that for larger surface area\nS\nS\nand higher total volume\nV\nV\n, the probability of failure is reduced.\nWhile the inclusion of the robot’s start position within the forbidden region poses a limitation for standard navigation, this issue can be mitigated. Specifically, an intermediate target can be introduced to guide the robot away from the ball joint region during the initial stage. Once the robot has cleared the critical area, the navigation can proceed using the appropriate expansion method.\n6.2  Spherical Robot Simulation\nFigure 28:\nSimulation of a spherical robot navigating around a truss obstacle with tuning parameter\nk\n=\n40\nk=40\n, starting from 25 initial positions with a common goal at\nP\nd\n=\n(\n0\n,\n0\n,\n0\n)\nP_{d}=(0,0,0)\n: (a) Trajectories generated using the full enclosure ball joint expansion method. (b) Trajectories generated using the minimal ball joint expansion method. In both cases, the spherical robot radius is set to\nR\n=\nr\ncylinder\nR=r_{\\text{cylinder}}\n.\nFigure 29:\nSpherical robot trajectories for simulation of composite obstacles with no ball joint in a cubic room for 100 initial positions and common goal.

Fig.\n28\n(a) shows the trajectories generated using ball joints that fully enclose the intersection curves of the cylinders. Fig.\n28\n(b) shows the trajectories for the minimal ball joint expansion method. In both simulations, the tuning parameter is set to\nk\n=\n40\nk=40\nand the robot radius is defined as\nR\n=\nr\ncylinder\nR=r_{\\text{cylinder}}\n. Although the minimal ball joint expansion yields a slightly larger free space, the resulting trajectories are nearly identical between the two expansion methods, indicating that both methods are viable for the motion planning problem.\nLarge inter-cylinder angles:\nAn important observation from the minimal ball joint expansion method is that finite cylindrical obstacles with axes that start at a common point and form a pairwise angle that is greater than\n90\n∘\n90^{\\circ}\ndo\nnot\nrequire an additional spherical obstacle as a ball joint, as illustrated in Fig.\n29\n. Fig.\n29\n(a) shows a simulation involving a tetrahedral obstacle formation composed of four intersecting half-cylinders, each forming an angle of approximately\n109\n∘\n109^{\\circ}\nwith the others. Figure\n29\n(b) presents a simulation with a composite obstacle formed by three mutually perpendicular full-cylinders. Both simulations were performed for a point robot with\nk\n=\n5\nk=5\n, evaluating trajectories from 100 initial positions toward a common target. Since no ball joint is included in these obstacle configurations, the simulations are equivalent to that of a spherical robot, as the radii of all internal obstacles are uniformly expanded by\nR\nR\n. In contrast, if ball joints were required, their required expansion would exceed\nR\nR\n. Additionally, it is evident that for any reasonably small spherical robot of radius\nR\nR\n, the configuration of\nR\nR\n-expanded cylindrical obstacles preserves the pairwise intersections requirement, thereby maintaining the validity of the original 3-D model space.\n∘\n\\circ\n7  Conclusions\nThis technical report has presented a comprehensive framework for the construction and analysis of polynomial navigation functions in 3-D workspaces. The primary contributions of this work include the development of a unified polynomial framework for encoding 3-D obstacles, including spherical and various forms of capped cylindrical geometries, such as full, half, and finite cylinders. Through comprehensive gradient and Hessian analysis, we established the conditions under which these functions satisfy the fundamental properties of\npolarity\n(a unique global minimum at the target) and\nadmissibility\n(maximal value at the free space boundary). Furthermore, we extended the framework to handle pairwise intersecting obstacles, utilizing smooth composition techniques and\np\np\n-Rvachev functions to merge intersecting geometries while preserving the safety and smoothness of the navigation function.\nThe analytical results confirm that, for a sufficiently large tuning parameter\nk\nk\n, the navigation function effectively eliminates local minima within the interior of the free space. By partitioning the free space into distinct regions, we proved that critical points near internal obstacles and workspace boundaries are non-degenerate saddle points rather than local minima. These theoretical results were further validated through numerical simulations in complex 3-D environments.\nWhile this report establishes the theoretical foundations for 3-D polynomial navigation functions, several areas remain for future exploration. These include developing efficient real-time implementation strategies for robotic systems with higher degrees of freedom, investigating environment decomposition strategies for large-scale planning in complex non-convex environments, and generalizing the polynomial encoding to a broader class of obstacles beyond the current spherical and cylindrical catalog.\nReferences\n[1]\nD. E.
