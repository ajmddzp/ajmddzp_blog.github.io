Ground-truth offsets (\n,\n) are hidden throughout the evaluation episodes.\n1\nIntroduction\nOffline Reinforcement Learning (RL) leverages static datasets to avoid costly or risky online interactions\n[\n1\n,\n2\n]\n. Yet, agents trained on fully observable states often fail when deployed with noisy or corrupted observations. While robust offline RL methods address test-time perturbations, such as sensor noise or adversarial attacks\n[\n3\n]\n, a critical gap persists in addressing non-stationarity within the observation function—a challenge that fundamentally alters the agent’s perception of the environment over time.\nPrior\nonline algorithms\nthat consider the scope of non-stationarity as the observation function focus on learning agent morphologies\n[\n4\n]\nand generalization in Block MDPs\n[\n5\n]\n. While this scope of non-stationarity holds significant potential for real-world applications\n[\n6\n]\n, it remains underexplored. We focus on the episodic evolution of the observation function at test-time in offline RL. In our setup, each dimension of an agent’s state is influenced by an unknown, time-dependent constant additive offset that remains fixed within a single operational interval (an “episode”). This leads to a stream of evolving observation functions\n[\n7\n]\n, extending across multiple future episodes,\nwhere the offsets remain hidden throughout the prediction window\n. For instance, industrial robots might apply a daily calibration offset to each joint, while sensors can exhibit a deviation until the next scheduled recalibration. Similarly, in healthcare or finance, data may be partially aggregated or withheld to comply with regulations, effectively obscuring finer-grained variations and leaving a single offset as the dominant factor per episode. By only storing these representative offsets, we circumvent the challenges of continuous interaction buffers in bandwidth-constrained or privacy-sensitive environments. Because the offset can differ across state dimensions (e.g., different sensor or actuation channels), each state dimension can be affected by a different unknown bias that stays constant for that episode but evolves differently across episodes. Approaches that assume predefined perturbations can struggle with these abrupt, episodic shifts because such offsets violate the typical assumption of smoothly varying observation functions. Frequent retraining, hyperparameter optimization, or extensive online adaptation to new observation function evolution patterns are costly, risky (due to trial-and-error in safety-critical settings), and may be infeasible if these patterns no longer reflect assumptions made during training. By separating offset data (episodic calibration values) from the massive replay buffers, a zero-shot forecasting-based approach can anticipate each new offset from the beginning of the episode without requiring policy updates or making assumptions on task evolution at test time\n[\n8\n]\n. Modeling these multidimensional additive offsets as stable, per-episode constants presents a robust and efficient way to handle time-varying conditions in non-stationary environments where the evolution of tasks follows a non-Markovian, time-series pattern\n[\n9\n]\n, mitigating the risks of online exploration.\nFigure 2\n:\nOverview of the proposed\nForl\nframework at test-time. The observations are processed by both the trajectory buffer and the time-series\nforecasting foundation\nmodule\n[\n10\n]\n. Observation changes and actions sampled from the\npolicy\n(\nΔ\n​\no\n,\na\n)\n(\\Delta o,a)\n, are stored in the trajectory buffer. The\ndiffusion model\ngenerates candidate states\n{\n𝒔\nt\n(\n0\n)\n}\nk\n\\{\\boldsymbol{s}_{t}^{(0)}\\}_{k}\nconditioned on\n𝝉\n(\nt\n,\nw\n)\n\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{(t,w)}\n. The\ncandidate selection\nmodule then generates the estimated\ns\n~\nt\n\\tilde{s}_{t}\n.\nWe consider an offline RL setting during training where we have only access to a standard offline RL dataset collected from a stationary environment\n[\n3\n]\nwith fully observable states. Initial data may be collected under near-ideal conditions and then gradually affected by wear, tear, or other natural shifts—even as the underlying physical laws (dynamics) remain unchanged. At test time, however, we evaluate in a non-stationary environment where both the observation function and the observation space change due to time-dependent external factors. This setup can be interpreted as environments shifting along observation space dimensions while the initial state of the agent is sampled from a uniform distribution over the state space. A simplified version of this setup for an offset affecting only one dimension of the state is illustrated in Figure\n1\n. Here, the agent “knows” it is in a maze but does not know where it is in the maze. Furthermore,\nit will remain uncertain of its location across all episodes at test-time\n, as in every episode, a new offset leads to a systematic misalignment between perceived and actual positions. Importantly, these offsets may not conform to Gaussian or Markovian assumptions; instead, they may stem directly from complex, real-world time-series data\n[\n9\n]\nand remain constant throughout each episode. As a result, standard noise-driven or parametric state-estimation techniques, which typically rely on smoothly varying or randomly perturbed functions, cannot reliably identify these persistent, episode-wide offsets that are not available after the episode terminates. While zero-shot forecasting can adjust observation offsets, its performance depends on the forecaster’s accuracy. Similarly, integrating zero-shot forecasting into a model-based offline RL approach\n[\n3\n]\ncan underperform when real-world offsets deviate from predefined assumptions about future observation functions. Our approach uses the insight that the belief of the true states can be refined from a sequence of actions and effects. For instance, in maze navigation, if an agent misjudges its location and hits a wall, analyzing its actions and delta observations leading to the collision can provide evidence for likely locations within the maze.\nWe propose the\nF\norecasting in Non-stationary\nO\nffline\nRL\n(\nForl\n) framework (Figure\n2\n) for test-time adaptation in non-stationary environments where the observation function is perturbed by an arbitrary time-series.\nOur framework has two main ingredients:\nforecasting offsets with a zero-shot time-series forecasting model\n[\n10\n]\nfrom past episode offsets (ground truth offsets after the episode terminates are not accessible at test-time) and\na within-episode update of the state estimation using a conditional diffusion model\n[\n11\n]\ntrained on offline stationary data.\nContributions.\nWe unify the strengths of probabilistic forecasting and decision-making under uncertainty to enable continuous adaptation when the environment diverges from predictions. Consequently, our framework:\n(1)\naccommodates future offsets\nwithout assuming specific non-stationarity patterns during training\n, eliminating the need for retraining and hyperparameter tuning when the agent encounters new, unseen non-stationary patterns at test time, and\n(2)\ntargets non-trivial non-stationarities at test time without requiring environment interaction or knowledge of POMDPs during training\n.\n(3)\nForl\nintroduces a novel, modular framework combining a conditional diffusion model (\nForl\n-\nDm\n) for multimodal belief generation with a lightweight Dimension-wise Closest Match (DCM) fusion strategy, validated by extensive experiments on no-access to past offsets, policy-agnostic plug-and-play, offset magnitude-scaling, and inter/intra-episode drifts.\n(4)\nWe propose a novel benchmark that integrates offsets from real-world time-series datasets with standard offline RL benchmarks and demonstrate that\nForl\nconsistently outperforms baseline methods.\nBackground: Diffusion Models\nDenoising diffusion models\n[\n12\n,\n13\n]\naim to model the data distribution with\np\nθ\n​\n(\n𝒙\n0\n)\n:=\n∫\np\nθ\n​\n(\n𝒙\n0\n:\nN\n)\n​\n𝑑\n𝒙\n1\n:\nN\np_{\\theta}(\\boldsymbol{x}_{0}):=\\int p_{\\theta}(\\boldsymbol{x}_{0:N})\\,d\\boldsymbol{x}_{1:N}\nfrom samples\nx\n0\nx_{0}\nin the dataset.

General information on diffusion models is given in\nSection\n˜\nB.3\n.\n2\nMethod\nIn this section, we formulate our problem statement and describe our\nForl\ndiffusion model trained on the offline RL dataset to predict plausible states. Then, we introduce our online state estimation method,\nDimension-wise Closest Match that uses plausible states predicted by the multimodal\nForl\ndiffusion model (\nDm\n) and the states predicted from past episodes prior to evaluation by a probabilistic unimodal zero-shot time-series foundation model.\n2.1\nProblem Statement\nTraining (Offline Stationary MDP)\nWe begin with an episodic, stationary Markov Decision Process (MDP)\nℳ\ntrain\n=\n(\n𝒮\n,\n𝒜\n,\n𝒯\n,\nℛ\n,\nρ\n0\n)\n\\mathcal{M}_{\\text{train}}=(\\mathcal{S},\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{T},\\mathcal{R},\\rho_{0})\n, where the initial state distribution\nρ\n0\n\\rho_{0}\nis a uniform distribution over the state space\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\n. We only have access to an offline RL dataset\n𝒟\n=\n{\n(\n𝒔\nt\nk\n,\n𝒂\nt\nk\n,\n𝒔\nt\n+\n1\nk\n,\nr\nt\nk\n)\n}\n\\mathcal{D}=\\{(\\boldsymbol{s}^{k}_{t},\\boldsymbol{a}^{k}_{t},\\boldsymbol{s}^{k}_{t+1},r^{k}_{t})\\}\nwith\nk\nk\ntransitions collected from this MDP. Crucially, our\nForl\ndiffusion model and a diffusion policy\n[\n14\n]\nare trained offline using this dataset, such as the standard D4RL benchmark\n[\n15\n]\n, without making any assumptions about how the environment might become non‐stationary at test time.\nTest Environment (Sequence of POMDPs)\nAt test time, the agent faces an infinite sequence of POMDPs\n{\nℳ\n^\nj\n}\nj\n=\n1\n∞\n\\{\\hat{\\mathcal{M}}_{j}\\}_{j=1}^{\\infty}\n. Each POMDP is described by a 7-tuple\n[\n16\n]\nℳ\n^\nj\n=\n(\n𝒮\n,\n𝒜\n,\n𝒪\nj\n,\n𝒯\n,\nℛ\n,\nρ\n0\n,\n𝐱\nj\n)\n\\hat{\\mathcal{M}}_{j}=\\bigl(\\mathcal{S},\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{O}_{j},\\mathcal{T},\\mathcal{R},\\rho_{0},\\mathbf{x}_{j}\\bigr)\n, where the state space\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\n, action space\n𝒜\n\\mathcal{A}\n, transition function\n𝒯\n\\mathcal{T}\n, and the reward function\nℛ\n\\mathcal{R}\nremain identical to the training MDP.\n𝐱\n\\mathbf{x}\nis the observation function, where we restrict ourselves to deterministic versions (\n𝐱\n:\n𝒮\n→\n𝒪\n\\mathbf{x}:\\mathcal{S}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{O}\n)\n[\n17\n,\n6\n]\n.\nNon-stationary environments can be formulated in different ways.\nIn\nKhetarpal et al. [\n6\n]\n, a\ngeneral non-stationary RL\nformulation is put forward,\nwhich allows each component of the underlying MDP or POMDP to evolve over time, i.e.\n(\n𝒮\n​\n(\nt\n)\n,\n𝒜\n​\n(\nt\n)\n,\n𝒯\n​\n(\nt\n)\n,\nℛ\n​\n(\nt\n)\n,\n𝐱\n​\n(\nt\n)\n,\n𝒪\n​\n(\nt\n)\n)\n\\bigl(\\mathcal{S}(t),\\mathcal{A}(t),\\mathcal{T}(t),\\mathcal{R}(t),\\mathbf{x}(t),\\mathcal{O}(t)\\bigr)\n.\nA set\nκ\n\\kappa\nspecifies which of these components vary, and a\ndriver\ndetermines how they evolve. In particular,\npassive\ndrivers of non-stationarity imply that exogenous factors alone govern the evolution of the environment, independent of the agent’s actions.\nIn this work, we consider the scope of non-stationarity\n[\n6\n]\n(\nSection\n˜\nB.2\n) to be the observation function and the observation space, i.e.\nκ\n=\n{\n𝐱\n,\n𝒪\n}\n\\kappa=\\{\\mathbf{x},\\mathcal{O}\\}\n.\nWe consider the case where non-stationarity unfolds over episodes and where the observation function\n𝐱\nj\n\\mathbf{x}_{j}\nis different in each episode\nj\nj\n.\nThe change in the observation function is assumed to have an additive structure and is independent of the agent’s actions (passive non‐stationarity\n[\n6\n]\n).\nConcretely, the function\n𝐱\nj\n\\mathbf{x}_{j}\noffsets states\ns\nt\ns_{t}\nby a fixed offset\nb\nj\n∈\nℝ\nn\nb^{j}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}\n:\n𝒪\nj\n=\n{\ns\n+\nb\nj\n:\ns\n∈\n𝒮\n}\n,\n𝐱\nj\n​\n(\ns\n)\n=\ns\n+\nb\nj\n.\n\\mathcal{O}_{j}\\;=\\;\\{\\,s+b^{j}:\\,s\\in\\mathcal{S}\\},\\quad\\mathbf{x}_{j}(s)\\;=\\;s+b^{j}.\nImportantly, the sequence\n(\nb\nj\n)\n(b^{j})\ncan evolve under arbitrary real‐world time‐series data, and the agent\ndoes not have access to the ground-truth information throughout the evaluation\n—similar to scenarios where observations are only available periodically and shifts occur between these intervals. Thus, the episodes have a temporal order, relating to Non-Stationary Decision Processes (NSDP), defining a sequence of POMDPs\n[\n7\n]\n(\nSection\n˜\nB.2\n).\nPartial Observability and Historical Context\nSince\nb\nj\nb^{j}\nis\nnever directly observed\nfor\nP\nP\nepisodes into the future, each\nℳ\n^\nj\n\\hat{\\mathcal{M}}_{j}\nis a POMDP. The agent receives only the offset‐shifted observations\n(\no\nt\n)\n(o_{t})\n, where\no\nt\n=\ns\nt\n+\nb\nj\no_{t}=s_{t}+b^{j}\nwithout any noise. Moreover, the agent may have access to a limited historical context of previous offsets\n(\nb\nj\n−\nC\n,\n…\n,\nb\nj\n−\n1\n)\n(b^{j-C},\\dots,b^{j-1})\nat discrete intervals\nP\nP\n, but\nno direct information\nabout future offsets\n(\nb\nj\n,\nb\nj\n+\n1\n,\n…\n​\nb\nj\n+\nP\n−\n1\n)\n(b^{j},b^{j+1},\\dots b^{j+P-1})\n.\nHence, the agent must forecast and/or adapt to unknown future offsets without prior non‐stationary training.\nPartial Identifiability\nDespite observing\no\nt\n=\ns\nt\n+\nb\nj\no_{t}=s_{t}+b^{j}\n, the agent cannot generally disentangle\ns\nt\ns_{t}\nfrom\nb\nj\nb^{j}\n.\nFor any single observation, there are infinite possible pairs of state and offset that yield\no\nt\n=\ns\n′\n+\nb\n′\no_{t}=s^{\\prime}+b^{\\prime}\n. Additionally, the initial state distribution\nρ\n\\rho\nis uniform and does not provide information about\nb\nb\n.\nThus, we can only form a belief over\ns\nt\ns_{t}\nand refine that belief based on two sources of information:\na)\nthe sequence of actions and effects observed within an episode and\nb)\nthe sequence of past identified offsets.\nTo exploit source\na\n, we utilize a predictive model of commonly expected outcomes based on a diffusion model, which will be explained next. To make use of source\nb\n, we use a zero-shot forecasting model (see\nSection\n˜\n2.3\nfor details). Afterwards, both pieces of information are fused (\nSection\n˜\n2.4\n).\nFigure 3\n:\nCandidate states generated by\nForl\nDiffusion Model.\n2.2\nForl\nDiffusion Model\nIn our setting, we assume that the offsets added to the states are unobservable at test time, while the transition dynamics of the evaluation environment remain unchanged.\nTo eventually reduce the uncertainty about the underlying state,\nwe perform filtering or belief updates using the sequence of past interactions.\nTo understand why the history of interactions is indicative of a particular ground truth state, consider the following example in a maze environment illustrated in\nFig.\n˜\n3\n. When the agent moves north for three steps and then bumps into a wall, the possible ground truth states can only be those three steps south of any wall. The agent cannot observe the hidden green trajectory of ground-truth states; it only has access to the sequence of observation changes\n(\nΔ\n​\no\n)\n(\\Delta o)\nand action vectors, which narrows down the possible positions to four candidate regions—exactly those identified by our model.\nClearly, the distribution of possible states is highly multimodal,\nsuch that we propose using a diffusion model as a flexible predictive model of plausible states given the observed actions and outcomes.\nDiffusion models excel at capturing multimodal distributions\n[\n14\n]\n, making them well-suited for our task.\nWe train the diffusion model on offline data without offsets (\nb\nj\n=\n0\nb_{j}=0\n) which we detail below.\nTo distinguish between the trajectory timesteps in reinforcement learning (RL) and the timesteps in the diffusion process, we use the subscript\nt\n∈\n{\n0\n,\n…\n,\nT\n}\nt\\in\\{0,\\dots,T\\}\nto refer to RL timesteps and\nn\n∈\n{\n0\n,\n…\n,\nN\n}\nn\\in\\{0,\\dots,N\\}\nfor diffusion timesteps. We first begin by defining a subsequence of a trajectory\n𝝉\n(\nt\n,\nw\n)\n=\n[\n(\nΔ\n​\no\nt\n−\nw\n+\n1\n,\na\nt\n−\nw\n)\n,\n⋯\n,\n(\nΔ\n​\no\nt\n,\na\nt\n−\n1\n)\n]\n.\n\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{(t,w)}=\\left[\\left(\\Delta o_{t-w+1},a_{t-w}\\right),\\cdots,\\left(\\Delta o_{t},a_{t-1}\\right)\\right].\n(1)\nwhere delta observations\nΔ\n​\no\nt\n=\no\nt\n−\no\nt\n−\n1\n=\ns\nt\n−\ns\nt\n−\n1\n\\Delta o_{t}=o_{t}-o_{t-1}=s_{t}-s_{t-1}\ndenote the state changes (effects),\nw\nw\nis the window size.

Using the probabilistic\nZero-Shot FM\nwe generate (\nb\n^\nl\nj\n,\n…\n,\nb\n^\nl\nj\n+\nP\n−\n1\n{\\hat{b}^{j}_{l},\\dots,\\hat{b}_{l}^{j+P-1}}\n), where (\nl\nl\n) denotes the number of samples generated for each episode (timestamp). Since Lag-Llama is a probabilistic model, it can generate multiple samples per timestamp, conditioned on\nC\nC\nnumber of past contexts (\nb\nj\n−\nC\n,\n…\n,\nb\nj\n−\n1\n{b^{j-C},\\dots,b^{j-1}}\n). In practice, we forecast every dimension of\nb\nb\nindependently since the\nZero-Shot FM\n(Lag-Llama\n[\n10\n]\n) is a univariate probabilistic model.\n2.4\nForl\nState Estimation\nThe next step in our method is to fuse the information from the forecaster and the diffusion model into a state estimate used for control at test time.\nAt the beginning of an episode, no information can be obtained from the diffusion model, so for the first\nw\nw\nsteps we only rely on the forecaster’s mean prediction, i.e.\ns\n~\nt\n=\no\nt\n−\nb\n^\nj\n¯\n{\\tilde{s}_{t}}=o_{t}-\\overline{\\hat{b}^{j}}\nwhere the mean is taken over the\nl\nl\nsamples.\nFigure 4\n:\nDistribution of samples produced by DCM (histograms for 10k samples for illustration).\nAs soon as\nw\nw\nsteps are taken, our\nForl\nState Estimation\nimproves on the inferred state as detailed below.\nFigure\n2\noffers an overview of the entire system and Algorithm\n1\nprovides a detailed pseudocode.\nTo recap, the diffusion model generates samples\n{\n𝒔\nt\n(\n0\n)\n}\nk\n\\{\\boldsymbol{s}_{t}^{(0)}\\}_{k}\nfrom the in-episode history\nτ\n\\tau\n,\nEq.\n˜\n1\n. These samples represent a multimodal distribution of plausible state regions.\nThe\nZero-Shot FM\ngenerates\nl\nl\nsamples of offsets\n{\nb\n^\n}\nl\n\\{\\hat{b}\\}_{l}\nfrom which we compute forecasted states using\n{\n𝒔\n^\nt\n}\nl\n=\no\nt\n−\n{\nb\n^\n}\nl\n\\{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{s}}_{t}\\}_{l}=o_{t}-\\{\\hat{b}\\}_{l}\n.\nForl\n: Dimension-wise Closest Match (DCM)\nWe propose a lightweight approach to sample a good estimate based on the samples from the multimodal (\ndiffusion model\n{\n𝐬\nt\n(\n0\n)\n}\nk\n\\{\\boldsymbol{s}_{t}^{(0)}\\}_{k}\n) and unimodal (\nZero-Shot FM\n{\ns\n^\nt\nb\n}\nl\n\\{\\hat{s}^{b}_{t}\\}_{l}\n) distributions.\nLet\n𝒟\ndiffusion\n=\n{\n𝐱\n1\n,\n…\n,\n𝐱\nk\n}\n,\n𝒟\ntimeseries\n=\n{\n𝐲\n1\n,\n…\n,\n𝐲\nl\n}\n,\n\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{diffusion}}=\\{\\mathbf{x}_{1},\\dots,\\mathbf{x}_{k}\\},\\quad\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{timeseries}}=\\{\\mathbf{y}_{1},\\dots,\\mathbf{y}_{l}\\},\nwhere\n𝐱\ni\n,\n𝐲\nj\n∈\nℝ\nn\n\\mathbf{x}_{i},\\mathbf{y}_{j}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}\n. Then DCM constructs\n𝐳\n∈\nℝ\nn\n\\mathbf{z}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}\nby\nz\nd\n=\ny\nj\n∗\n​\n(\nd\n)\n,\nd\nwhere\nj\n∗\n​\n(\nd\n)\n=\narg\n⁡\nmin\nj\n⁡\n(\nmin\ni\n⁡\n|\nx\ni\n,\nd\n−\ny\nj\n,\nd\n|\n)\n,\nz_{d}\\;=\\;y_{j^{*}(d),d}\\quad\\text{where}\\quad j^{*}(d)\\;=\\;\\arg\\min_{j}\\Bigl(\\;\\min_{i}\\bigl|\\;x_{i,d}-y_{j,d}\\bigr|\\Bigr),\nwhere\nd\n=\n1\n​\n…\n​\nn\nd=1\\dots n\n.\nIn other words, for each dimension\nd\nd\n, we choose the sample from\n𝒟\ntimeseries\n\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{timeseries}}\nthat has the closest sample in\n𝒟\ndiffusion\n\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{diffusion}}\n. The process is straightforward yet effective, and under ideal sampling conditions for a toy dataset in\nFig.\n˜\n4\n, DCM approximately samples from the product distribution. DCM uses a non-parametric search to find the forecast sample with the highest score, which corresponds to the minimum dimension-wise distance. DCM’s prediction error is governed by the accuracy of the forecast samples in the unimodal\n𝒟\ntimeseries\n\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{timeseries}}\nthat achieves this best score. As we will demonstrate in the experiments, this approach empirically yields lower maximum errors and is more stable compared to other methods.\nForl\nAlgorithm\nAlgorithm\n1\nsummarizes the entire inference process at test time. We begin the episode by relying on the forecasted states\ns\n~\n0\n\\tilde{s}_{0}\n. As more transitions\n(\nΔ\n​\no\nt\n,\na\nt\n−\n1\n)\n(\\Delta o_{t},a_{t-1})\nbecome available, the\nForl\ndiffusion model proposes candidate states\n{\n𝒔\nt\n(\n0\n)\n}\nk\n\\{\\boldsymbol{s}_{t}^{(0)}\\}_{k}\nthrough\nretrospection\n—reasoning over the past in-episode experience to adapt state estimation on the fly when they begin to diverge from predictions. We then invoke DCM to blend the diffusion model’s candidates with the foundation model’s unimodal forecasts and obtain the final state estimate\ns\n~\nt\n\\tilde{s}_{t}\n. We use an off-the-shelf offline RL policy such as Diffusion-QL (\nDQL\n)\n[\n14\n]\nto select the agent’s action\na\nt\na_{t}\n.\nFigure 5\n:\nZero-shot forecasting results of Lag-Llama\n[\n10\n]\nfor the first univariate series (plotted) from the\nreal-data-A,D\ndatasets; experiments use the\nfirst two series from each dataset\n.\nSummary\nBy combining a powerful\nzero-shot\nforecasting model with a\nconditional diffusion\nmechanism,\nForl\naddresses partial observability in continuous state and action space when ground-truth offsets are unavailable. This procedure is performed in the\nabsence of ground-truth offsets for past, current, and future episodes over the interval\nj\n:\nj\n+\nP\nj:j+P\nat test time\n. DCM provides a computationally inexpensive yet effective way of using the multimodal diffusion candidates and unimodal time-series forecasts. This robust adaptation approach yields a state estimate\ns\n~\nt\n\\tilde{s}_{t}\n, aligned with the agent’s retrospective experience in the stationary offline RL dataset, incorporating a prospective external offset forecast.\nTable 1\n:\nNormalized scores (mean ± std.) for\nForl\nframework and the baselines.\nBold are the best values, and those not significantly different (\np\n>\n0.05\np>0.05\n,

By using the model learned from the offline data,\nDmbp\n+\nLag\naims to refine the forecasted states to make robust state estimations. The underlying policies throughout our experiments are identical policy checkpoints for both our method and the baselines.\nFigure 6\n:\nVisualization of states, predicted states as the agent navigates the environment.\nIllustrative Example\nFigs.\n˜\n6\nand\n16\nillustrate an agent navigating the\nmaze2d-large\nenvironment where the true position is labeled as “state”. The agent receives an observation indicating where it\nbelieves\nit is located due to unknown time-dependent factors. The candidate states predicted by the\nForl\ndiffusion model are shown as circles. Importantly, the agent’s\n(\nΔ\n​\no\n,\na\n)\n(\\Delta o,a)\n-trajectory can reveal possible states for the agent.\nForl\n’s diffusion model (\nDm\n) component predicts these candidate states by using observation changes\n(\nΔ\n​\no\n)\n(\\Delta o)\nand corresponding actions\n(\na\n)\n(a)\n. The possible candidate regions where the agent can be are limited, and our model successfully captures these locations.\nForl\n’s candidate selection module (DCM) uses the samples from the forecaster and the diffusion model to recover a close estimate for the state. In contrast, the baseline\nDQL\n+\nLag\n-\ns\n¯\n\\bar{s}\nrelies on the forecaster\n[\n10\n]\nfor state predictions, which are significantly farther from the actual state. Consistent with the results in\nFig.\n˜\n7\n,\nForl\nreduces prediction errors at test-time, thereby improving performance.\nFigure 7\n:\nPrediction Error in recovering true agent state.\n3.1\nResults\nFORL outperforms both pure forecasting (\nDQL\n+\nLag\n-\ns\n¯\n\\bar{s}\n) and the two-stage strategy that first predicts offsets with a time-series model and then applies a noise-robust offline RL algorithm (\nDmbp\n+\nLag\n). Its advantage is consistent across previously unseen non-stationary perturbations from five domains, each introducing a distinct univariate series into a separate state dimension at test time.\nWe present the average normalized scores over the prediction length\nP\nP\nacross multiple episodes run in the D4RL\n[\n15\n]\nand OGBench\n[\n21\n]\nfor each time-series in Table\n1\n. We conduct pairwise Welch’s t-tests across all settings.\nFigure\n7\nplots the\nℓ\n2\n\\ell_{2}\nnorm between the ground-truth states\ns\nt\ns_{t}\nand those predicted by\nForl\nand the baselines in the\nantmaze\nand\nmaze2d\nenvironments. Consistent with the average scores,\nForl\nachieves the lowest prediction error on average.\nFigure 8\n:\nDM Ablations\n3.1.1\nNo Access to Past Offsets\nWe evaluate different variants of using\nDm\nand\nZero-Shot FM\nwhen we do not have any access to past offsets in\nFig.\n˜\n8\n.\nForl\n-\nDm\n(\nDm\n):\nDiffusion Model utilizes the candidate states generated by the\nForl\n’s diffusion model component (Section\n2.2\n), which can be a multimodal distribution (\nFig.\n˜\n3\n). Compared to\nDm\n, the full\nForl\nframework yields a 97.8% relative performance improvement. Notably,\nDm\nperforms on par with our extended baselines that incorporate historical offsets and forecasting—\nDmbp\n+\nLag\n,\nDQL\n+\nLag\n-\ns\n¯\n\\bar{s}\n, and\nDQL\n+\nLag\n-\ns\n~\n\\tilde{s}\n. Moreover, without access to historical offset information before evaluation,\nDm\nachieves a 151.4% improvement over\nDQL\n, demonstrating its efficacy as a standalone module trained solely on a standard, stationary offline RL dataset without offset labels.\nH-Lag\n:\nWe maintain a history of offsets generated by\nDm\nover the most recent\nC\nC\nepisodes (excluding the evaluation interval\nP\nP\n, since offsets are not revealed after episode termination at test-time). We then feed this history into the\nZero-Shot FM\nto generate offset samples for the next\nP\nP\nevaluation episodes. These samples are applied directly at test time.\nH-Lag\n+\ndcm\n:\nWe initially follow the same procedure in\nH-Lag\nto obtain predictions from\nZero-Shot FM\n. Then, we apply\nDCM\nto these predicted offsets and the candidate states generated by\nForl\n’s diffusion model. We also compare against\nMed\n+\ndcm\nand\nMed\n+\nNoise\n, simpler median-based heuristics detailed in\nAppendix\n˜\nG\n. Empirically,\nH-Lag\n+\ndcm\noutperforms\nH-Lag\n, demonstrating that DCM with\nForl\n’s diffusion model can improve robustness. Overall, scores and prediction errors indicate that just using the samples from\nDm\nhas better scores on average, while\nH-Lag\n+\ndcm\nis more stable in\nFig.\n˜\n15\n.\n3.1.2\nDimension-wise Closest Match (DCM) Ablations\nFigure 9\n:\nCandidate Selection\nWe compare\nForl\n(DCM) against four alternative fusion strategies.\nForl(KDE)\n: For each dimension, we fit a kernel density estimator (KDE) on\n𝒟\ndiffusion\n=\n{\n𝒔\nt\n(\n0\n)\n}\nk\n\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{diffusion}}=\\{\\boldsymbol{s}_{t}^{(0)}\\}_{k}\nand then we evaluate that probability density function for each point in\n𝒟\ntimeseries\n\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{timeseries}}\n. Then, we take the product of these densities in each dimension to obtain the weight for each sample\ns\n^\nt\nb\n\\hat{s}^{b}_{t}\n.\nWe obtain a single representative sample by taking the weighted average of samples in\n𝒟\ntimeseries\n\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{timeseries}}\n.\nTo ensure stability, when the sum of the weights is near zero, we use the mean of the\n𝒟\ntimeseries\n\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{timeseries}}\nas the states. We use Scott’s rule\n[\n24\n]\nto compute the bandwidth.\nDM-FS\n-\ns\n¯\n\\bar{s}\n,\nDM-FS\n-\ns\n~\n\\tilde{s}\nselect the closest prediction from DM to the mean and median of the\nZero-Shot FM\n’s predictions, respectively.\nForl\n(\nmax\n) constructs a diagonal multivariate distribution from the dimension-wise mean and standard deviation of the forecasted states, then selects the sample predicted by our diffusion model with the highest likelihood under that distribution. Although all baselines fuse information using the same two sets generated by the diffusion model and\nZero-Shot FM\n, DCM has higher performance. In\nTable\n˜\n8\nwe compute the maximum, minimum, and mean prediction error values over the test episodes used in\nFig.\n˜\n6\n.\nForl\n(DCM) yields significantly stable prediction errors (\nMaximum Error\n↓\n\\texttt{Maximum Error}\\downarrow\n:\n2.40\n) for both maximum error and mean error compared to\nForl\n(\nmax\n) (\nMaximum Error\n↓\n\\texttt{Maximum Error}\\downarrow\n:\n9.33\n) demonstrating its robustness.\n3.1.3\nIntra-episode Non-stationarity\nFigure 10\n:\nIntra-Episode Performance\nOur framework can natively handle intra-episode offsets, where the offset changes every\nf\n=\n50\nf=50\ntimesteps. In this setting, the offsets become available after the episode terminates, but the agent is subject to a time-dependent unknown offset within the episode. Zero-shot forecasting foundation module can generate samples before the episode begins. Our diffusion model (\nForl\n-\nDm\n) itself does not rely on the forecasts of the foundation module and only tracks observation changes and actions which are invariant to the offsets. The DCM can adaptively fuse information from both models at each timestep without requiring any hyperparameters.\nTables\n˜\n10\nand\n10\nshow the average scores for\nDQL\nvs.\nForl\n-\nDm\nand\nDQL\n+\nLag\n-\ns\n¯\n\\bar{s}\nvs.\nForl\n. Among the algorithms that do not use any past ground truth offsets\nDQL\nand\nForl\n-\nDm\n, only using the diffusion model of\nForl\nsignificantly increases performance. When we have access to past offsets,\nForl\nobtains a superior performance. This shows that our method covers both cases, when information is available and not available, even when offsets are not constant throughout the episode.\n3.1.4\nOffset-Scaling\nFigure 11\n:\nImpact of offset scaling\n(\nα\n)\n(\\alpha)\non average normalized scores.\nWe scale the offsets with\nα\n\\alpha\nacross all maze experiments. We conduct experiments in 5 environments (all antmaze and maze2d used in Table\n1\n) across 5 time-series dataset setups with\nα\n∈\n\\alpha\\in\n{0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0}, where\nα\n=\n0\n\\alpha=0\nis the standard offline RL environment used during training and\nα\n=\n1.0\n\\alpha=1.0\nis our evaluation setup.

We observe similar performance gains when applying\nForl\nto other policies (\nAppendices\n˜\nE\nand\nE\n), including Implicit Q-Learning (\nIql\n)\n[\n26\n]\nand\nFQL\n[\n23\n]\n, as detailed in\nTable\n˜\n4\nand\nTable\n˜\n7\n.\n4\nRelated Work\nReinforcement Learning in Non-Stationary Environments\nExisting works in non-stationary reinforcement learning (RL) predominantly focus on adapting to changing transition dynamics and reward functions.\nAckermann et al. [\n27\n]\npropose an offline RL framework that incorporates structured non-stationarity in reward and transition functions by learning hidden task representations and predicting them at test time. Although our work also investigates the intersection of non-stationary environments and offline RL, we assume stationarity during training. To learn adaptive policies\nonline\n, meta-learning algorithms have been proposed as a promising approach\n[\n28\n,\n29\n,\n30\n]\n.\nAl-Shedivat et al. [\n29\n]\nexplores a competitive multi-agent environment where transition dynamics change. While these approaches provide valuable insights, they often require samples from the current environment and struggle in non-trivial non-stationarity, highlighting the need for more future-oriented methods\n[\n31\n,\n9\n]\n. Examples of such future-oriented approaches include Proactively Synchronizing Tempo (ProST)\n[\n9\n]\nand Prognosticator\n[\n31\n]\n, which address the evolution of transition and reward functions over time. ProST leverages a forecaster, namely, Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and a model predictor to optimize for future policies in environments to overcome the time-synchronization issue in time-elapsing MDPs. This approach aligns with our focus on time-varying environments and similarly utilizes real-world finance (e.g., stock price) time-series datasets to model non-stationarity. Both ProST and Prognosticator assume that states are fully observable during testing and that online interaction with the environment is possible during training—conditions that are not always feasible in the real world. Instead, our approach assumes that states are not fully observable and that direct interaction with the environment during training is not feasible, necessitating that the policy be learned exclusively from a pre-collected dataset.\nRobust offline RL\nTesting-time robust offline RL methods\nDmbp\n[\n3\n]\n,\nRorl\n[\n25\n]\nexamine scenarios where a noise-free, stationary dataset is used for training, but corruption is introduced during testing. This is distinct from\n[\n3\n]\n, training-time robust offline RL\n[\n32\n,\n33\n]\n, which assumes a corrupted training dataset. Both\nRorl\n[\n25\n]\nand\nDmbp\n[\n3\n]\nassume access only to a clean, uncorrupted offline RL dataset, as\nForl\n, and they are evaluated in a perturbed environment. To the best of our knowledge,\nForl\nis the first work to extend this setting to a non-Markovian, time-evolving, non-stationary deployment environment. We focus on time-dependent exogenous factors from real-data that are aligned with the definition of a non-stationary environment\n[\n6\n]\n.\nDiffusion models in offline RL\nDiffusion models\n[\n12\n]\nhave seen widespread adoption in RL\n[\n34\n,\n35\n]\ndue to their remarkable expressiveness, particularly in representing multimodal distributions, scalability, and stable training properties. In the context of offline RL, diffusion models have been used for representing policies\n[\n14\n,\n36\n,\n37\n,\n38\n]\n, planners\n[\n39\n,\n40\n]\n, data synthesis\n[\n41\n,\n42\n]\n, and removing noise\n[\n3\n]\n. Notably, Diffusion Q-learning\n[\n14\n]\nleverages conditional diffusion model policies to learn from offline RL datasets, maintaining proximity to behavior policy while utilizing Q-value function guidance. In contrast, our method harnesses diffusion models to learn from a sequence of actions and effect tuples, leveraging the multimodal capabilities of diffusion models to identify diverse candidate locations of the hidden states.\n5\nConclusion\nWe introduce\nF\norecasting in Non-stationary\nO\nffline\nRL\n(\nForl\n), a novel framework designed to be robust to passive non-stationarities that arise at test time. This is crucial when an agent trained on an offline RL dataset is deployed in a non-stationary environment or when the environment begins to exhibit partial observability due to unknown, time-varying factors.\nForl\nleverages diffusion probabilistic models and zero-shot time series foundation models to correct unknown offsets in observations, thereby enhancing the adaptability of learned policies. Our empirical results across diverse time-series datasets, OGBench\n[\n21\n]\nand D4RL\n[\n15\n]\nbenchmarks, demonstrate that\nForl\nnot only bridges the gap between forecasting and non-stationary offline RL but also consistently outperforms the baselines. Our approach is currently limited by the assumption of additive perturbations. For future work, we plan to extend our work to more general observation transformations.\nAcknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\nGeorg Martius is a member of the Machine Learning Cluster of Excellence, EXC number 2064/1 – Project number 390727645.

Policy constraint methods actively avoid querying OOD actions during training by leveraging probabilistic metrics which can be explicit\n[\n46\n,\n47\n]\n, implicit\n[\n48\n,\n49\n]\nf\nf\n-divergence\n[\n50\n]\n, or integral probability metrics\n[\n51\n]\n. These metrics ensure that the learned policy\nπ\nθ\n\\pi_{\\theta}\nremains close to the behavior policy\nπ\nβ\n\\pi_{\\beta}\nthat generated the offline RL dataset\n[\n1\n]\n. Similarly, pessimistic value function approaches regularize the value function or the Q-function to avoid overestimations in OOD regions. Model-based offline RL methods\n[\n52\n]\n, on the other hand, focus on learning the environment’s dynamics, benefiting from the strengths of supervised learning approaches. However, in the same vein, these methods are susceptible to the distribution shift problem in Offline RL\n[\n1\n]\n. We detail the offline RL algorithms used in our experiments in\nAppendix\n˜\nE\n.\nPark et al. [\n53\n]\nemphasize the challenges of generalizing policies to test-time states which are not in the support of the offline RL dataset. While prior works have investigated the issue of generalization\n[\n38\n,\n54\n]\n, in testing-time robust RL methods\n[\n3\n]\nthis challenge is exacerbated through the introduction of noise into the states by an unknown adversary.\nAppendix B\nBackground\nB.1\nReinforcement Learning\nMarkov Decision Processes (MDPs) are often used to formalize Reinforcement Learning (RL). MDP is defined by the tuple\nℳ\n≐\n(\n𝒮\n,\n𝒜\n,\n𝒯\n,\nℛ\n,\nρ\n0\n,\nγ\n)\n\\mathcal{M}\\doteq\\bigl(\\mathcal{S},\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{T},\\mathcal{R},\\rho_{0},\\gamma\\bigr)\nwhere\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\nis the state space,\n𝒜\n\\mathcal{A}\nis the action space,\n𝒯\n\\mathcal{T}\nis the transition function (which may be deterministic or stochastic),\nℛ\n:\n𝒮\n×\n𝒜\n→\nℝ\n\\mathcal{R}:\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}\nis the reward function,\nρ\n0\n\\rho_{0}\nis the initial state distribution and\nγ\n∈\n[\n0\n,\n1\n)\n\\gamma\\in[0,1)\nis the discount factor\n[\n55\n]\n. In online and off-policy RL algorithms an agent can interact with the environment using a parameterized policy\nπ\nθ\n​\n(\n𝒂\n|\n𝒔\n)\n\\pi_{\\theta}(\\boldsymbol{a}|\\boldsymbol{s})\n, to maximize the expected return\n𝔼\nπ\n​\n[\n∑\nt\nγ\nt\n​\nr\n​\n(\n𝒔\nt\n,\n𝒂\nt\n)\n]\n\\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}\\left[\\sum_{t}\\gamma^{t}r\\left(\\boldsymbol{s}_{t},\\boldsymbol{a}_{t}\\right)\\right]\n. In contrast, offline RL requires the agent to learn from a static dataset\n𝒟\n=\n{\n(\n𝒔\nk\n,\n𝒂\nk\n,\n𝒔\nk\n′\n,\nr\nk\n)\n}\nk\n=\n1\nN\n\\mathcal{D}=\\{(\\boldsymbol{s}_{k},\\boldsymbol{a}_{k},\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\prime}_{k},r_{k})\\}^{N}_{k=1}\ngenerated by a generally unknown behavior policy\nπ\nβ\n​\n(\n𝒂\n|\n𝒔\n)\n\\pi_{\\beta}(\\boldsymbol{a}|\\boldsymbol{s})\n[\n1\n]\n.\nB.2\nNon-Stationary Environments\nWe next review tangential definitions and formalisms used for non-stationary environments.\nDefinition B.1\n(Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes\n[\n16\n,\n7\n,\n6\n]\n)\n.\nA Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) is given by the tuple\nℳ\n^\n=\n(\n𝒮\n,\n𝒜\n,\n𝒪\n,\n𝒯\n,\nℛ\n,\n𝐱\n,\nρ\n0\n,\nγ\n)\n,\n\\hat{\\mathcal{M}}\\,=\\,\\bigl(\\mathcal{S},\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{O},\\mathcal{T},\\mathcal{R},\\mathbf{x},\\rho_{0},\\gamma\\bigr),\nwhere\n𝒪\n\\mathcal{O}\nis the observation space and\n𝐱\n\\mathbf{x}\nis the observation function.

[\n6\n]\npresent a\ngeneral non-stationary RL\nformulation, which allows each component of the underlying MDP or POMDP to evolve over time. Concretely, this time-varying tuple is denoted as\n(\n𝒮\n​\n(\nt\n)\n,\n𝒜\n​\n(\nt\n)\n,\n𝒯\n​\n(\nt\n)\n,\nℛ\n​\n(\nt\n)\n,\n𝐱\n​\n(\nt\n)\n,\n𝒪\n​\n(\nt\n)\n)\n\\bigl(\\mathcal{S}(t),\\mathcal{A}(t),\\mathcal{T}(t),\\mathcal{R}(t),\\mathbf{x}(t),\\mathcal{O}(t)\\bigr)\nwhere each element is represented by a function\nφ\n​\n(\ni\n,\nt\n)\n\\varphi(i,t)\n, indicating its variation with time\nt\nt\nand input\ni\ni\n[\n6\n]\n.\nScope\n, denoted by a set\nκ\n\\kappa\n, specifies which of these components vary.\nDefinition B.2\n(Scope of Non-Stationarity\n[\n6\n]\n)\n.\nGiven the general non-stationary RL framework, the\nscope of non-stationarity\nis the subset\nκ\n⊆\n{\n𝒮\n,\n𝒜\n,\nℛ\n,\n𝒯\n,\n𝐱\n,\n𝒪\n}\n,\n\\kappa\\,\\subseteq\\,\\{\\mathcal{S},\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{R},\\mathcal{T},\\mathbf{x},\\mathcal{O}\\},\nindicating which components of the environment evolve over time.\nNotably,\nChandak [\n7\n]\ndefines Non-Stationary Decision Process (NSDP) as a sequence of POMDPs, with non-stationarity confined to the subset\nκ\n⊆\n{\nℛ\n,\n𝒯\n,\n𝐱\n}\n\\kappa\\subseteq\\{\\mathcal{R},\\mathcal{T},\\mathbf{x}\\}\n, where the initial state distribution\nρ\n0\n,\nj\n\\rho_{0,j}\nvaries between POMDPs. Existing research in non‑stationary RL largely focuses on the episodic evolution of transition dynamics and reward functions\n[\n27\n]\n. In contrast, the evolution of observation functions remains underexplored, despite its potential for real-world applicability and thus demands further investigation\n[\n6\n]\n.

Diffusion Q-Learning (\nDQL\n)\n[\n14\n]\nserves as our base policy across all baselines and for our method in D4RL experiments\n[\n15\n]\n. Details on\nDQL\nare provided in Section\nE\nD.1\nDQL\nExtensions with\nZero-Shot FM\nFor our baselines, we use a diffusion-based offline RL policy,\nDQL\n[\n14\n]\n, with three variations:\n•\nDQL\n:\nDQL\npolicy directly generates actions conditioned on the observations. We include it to demonstrate how large episodic offsets degrade policy performance, and its consistently poor performance underscores the difficulty introduced by our offset settings.\n•\nDQL\n+\nLag\n-\ns\n¯\n\\bar{s}\n:\nWe use\nZero-Shot FM\n(Lag-Llama\n[\n10\n]\n) to forecast episodic offsets over a horizon of\nP\nP\nepisodes using pre-deployment offset history, and then subtract the mean predicted offset corresponding to that episode from the observations. Thus,\nDQL\ngenerates actions conditioned on the sample mean of the forecasted states\n{\ns\n^\nt\nb\n}\nl\n\\{\\hat{s}^{b}_{t}\\}_{l}\n. Although\nDQL\n+\nLag\n-\ns\n¯\n\\bar{s}\noutperforms\nDQL\n, a straightforward application of forecasting and decision-making reveals performance degradation when offsets lack adaptive correction.\n•\nDQL\n+\nLag\n-\ns\n~\n\\tilde{s}\n:\nWe use the sample median instead of the sample mean in\nDQL\n+\nLag\n-\ns\n¯\n\\bar{s}\n, to mitigate outlier effects.

Similar to our framework, perturbed states are passed to\nDmbp\n, which removes the perturbations; the generated state is then fed to the policy. For a fair comparison, we adopt the policies also used in their work for our experiments,\nRorl\n[\n25\n]\nand\nTd\n3\nBc\n[\n2\n]\nalongside\nDQL\n.\nDmbp\n+\nLag\nextends\nDmbp\nwith the forecasting module in our experiments.

A naive integration of\nDmbp\nrelies on initial ground‐truth states and underperforms.\nFor the evaluation of\nDmbp\nwe use the open source code and the suggested hyperparameters available in\n[\n56\n]\n. To improve the performance of\nDmbp\n, we conducted evaluations at test-time and reported the best-performing results for a range of different diffusion timesteps.\nDmbp\nrequires the diffusion timesteps to be manually defined based on different noise scales and types. Hence, we use the diffusion timesteps across a range of noise scales\n{\n0.15\n,\n0.25\n,\n0.5\n}\n\\{0.15,0.25,0.5\\}\nfor maze and\n{\n0.05\n,\n0.1\n,\n0.15\n,\n0.25\n}\n\\{0.05,0.1,0.15,0.25\\}\nfor kitchen environments and identify that the best performance requires different noise scales across environment datasets.

To achieve this, it introduces a conservative smoothing mechanism that balances mitigating abrupt changes in the value function for proximate states and avoiding value overestimation in risky regions that are absent from the dataset. Concretely, RORL regularizes both the policy and the value function, leveraging bootstrapping Q-functions and conservative smoothing of the perturbed states. This formulation yields robust training under adversarial perturbations in the observation function while preserving strong performance even in unperturbed environments. However, although using RORL as our base policy improved performance in\nmaze2d\nenvironments,\nForl\nsignificantly outperforms both its naive usage, the extension with our forecasting module\nRorl\n+\nLag\n-\ns\n¯\n\\bar{s}\n, and\nDmbp\n+\nLag\n-R in\nTable\n˜\n2\nand\nTable\n˜\n3\n.

LAG denotes the integration of a zero-shot time-series foundation model\n[\n10\n]\n. While\nForl\nand\nmax\nalso utilize this model, the subscripts are omitted for brevity.\nFigure 15\n:\nPerformance comparison without access to past offsets.\nAverage normalized scores and prediction errors for\nForl\n(ours)\nversus baselines, aggregated over 25 experiments (5 random seeds each) in D4RL\n[\n15\n]\n. LAG denotes the integration of a zero-shot time-series foundation model\n[\n10\n]\n. However, in this setting\nZero-Shot FM\nuses the samples from\nDm\ninstead of past offsets.\nTo analyze the challenging identifiability issue arising from (i) non‑smoothly varying offsets and (ii) the unobservability of ground truth offsets throughout the evaluation interval, we implement a set of methods for the setting where we never have delayed access to past ground truth offsets.\nFig.\n˜\n14\nshows the average normalized scores and prediction accuracies over 25 environment–non-stationarity pairs across five random seeds in navigation control tasks with continuous state and action spaces. Overall, these methods underperform compared to\nForl\n. Among the cases with no access to past offsets (see\nFig.\n˜\n15\n), the best-performing methods are our proposed candidate state generation module (\nForl\n-\nDm\n) and\nH-Lag\n+\ndcm\n, a version of\nForl\nthat utilizes\nZero-Shot FM\nin addition to\nDm\nwhich we detailed in\nSection\n˜\n3.1.1\n.\nForl\n-\nDm\n(\nDm\n)\nForl\n-\nDm\n, which we also refer to as\nDm\nfor brevity, directly uses the state predicted by the diffusion model component. Given the multimodal nature of these candidate states, this selection does not fully leverage our framework. Yet,\nDm\noutperforms the baselines when no past offsets are used. Additional comparisons in\nTable\n˜\n6\nwith other standard statistical methods like\nDm-Mad\n,\nDm-Ransac\n,\nDm-Running\n-\nμ\n\\mu\n,\nDm-Running\n-\nμ\n\\mu\n-p\nindicate that only using the sample predicted by the diffusion model yields higher scores on average.\nMed\n+\ndcm\nWe compute the median of the predicted offsets from the previous episode, beginning with the first episode predicted by\nForl\n’s diffusion model. We then fit a Gaussian distribution centered at this median and sample\nl\nl\noffsets from it, matching the sample count of\nZero-Shot FM\n. Next, we apply\nDCM\nto these samples with the candidates generated by the diffusion model.\nFigure 16\n:\nIllustrations of states, observations, diffusion model predictions\n{\ns\nt\n(\n0\n)\n}\nk\n\\{\\boldsymbol{s}_{t}^{(0)}\\}_{k}\n, and predicted states from\nForl\n(DCM),\nForl\n-\nDm\n,\nDQL\n+\nLag\n-\ns\n¯\n\\bar{s}\n,\nDQL\n+\nLag\n-\ns\n~\n\\tilde{s}\n,\nForl\n(\nmax\n),\nDmbp\n+\nLag\nare shown.\nThese visualizations are from the same setting presented in\nFig.\n˜\n12\n. Maximum, minimum, and mean prediction errors across episodes for this task are provided in\nTable\n˜\n8\n.\nMed\n+\nNoise\nWe begin by computing the median offset produced by the diffusion model during the first evaluation episode similar to\nMed\n+\ndcm\n. Thereafter, we treat these offsets as evolving according to a random walk, where each offset is predicted as the previous value with white noise increments.\nDm-Mad\nDm-Mad\nfollows a state estimation based on robust statistics\n[\n69\n]\n.\nDm-Mad\ncomputes the coordinate-wise median of the differences between the observation and each denoiser prediction and discards any sample whose absolute deviation from this median exceeds\nϵ\n\\epsilon\nx Median Absolute Deviation (MAD). Then, it takes the median of the remaining inliers to obtain a robust offset estimate and subtracts that offset from the observation to obtain the state\ns\nt\n~\n\\tilde{s_{t}}\n.\nDm-Ransac\nDm-Ransac\nis a RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC)\n[\n70\n]\nbased state estimation using the samples from our\nDm\n.\nDm-Ransac\ncalculates the offsets using the states generated by our\nDm\nand the observation, setting an adaptive per-dimension threshold as\nϵ\n\\epsilon\nx MAD. Then, it repeatedly samples a random offset candidate and chooses the candidate whose inlier set (differences within that threshold) is the largest. Then, it takes the average of those inliers to estimate the offset.\nDm-Running\n-\nμ\n\\mu\nDm-Running\n-\nμ\n\\mu\ncomputes a numerically stable, global running mean\n[\n71\n,\n72\n]\nof offsets from\nDm\naggregated across all timesteps and episodes.\nDm-Running\n-\nμ\n\\mu\n-p\nDm-Running\n-\nμ\n\\mu\n-p\ncomputes an online average of offsets\n[\n71\n,\n72\n]\nfrom\nDm\n(Running-\nμ\n\\mu\n) per episode\np\np\n.

H\nCandidate Selection\nThe results in\nTable\n˜\n9\n,\nTable\n˜\n8\n, and\nTable\n˜\n7\nshow that\nForl\n(DCM) more consistently performs better than other methods. Although the KDE-based\nForl(KDE)\nmethod performs well in\nantmaze-medium-diverse\n, it significantly underperforms in\ncube-single-play\n(\nTable\n˜\n7\n). Moreover, it requires bandwidth selection and a fallback mechanism to handle numerical instability, which highlights the practical advantage of DCM.\nForl\n(\nmax\n), also referred to as\nmax\nfor brevity, can fail when the forecast mean of\nD\nt\n​\ni\n​\nm\n​\ne\n​\ns\n​\ne\n​\nr\n​\ni\n​\ne\n​\ns\nD_{timeseries}\nis biased, misleading it to select a candidate from a geometrically distant mode that appears more likely under an inaccurate forecast. In contrast, DCM succeeds because its state estimation is not dependent on the forecast’s mean, but on a non-parametric search for the forecast sample with the highest score (minimum dimension-wise distance). Hence, DCM’s prediction error is governed by the accuracy of the forecast sample in\nD\nt\n​\ni\n​\nm\n​\ne\n​\ns\n​\ne\n​\nr\n​\ni\n​\ne\n​\ns\nD_{timeseries}\nwith the best score. Empirically, this yields lower maximum and mean errors compared to\nmax\n. The timeseries forecaster can generate a large set of samples that can be systematically biased, which is why we observe that\nDQL\n+\nLag\n-\ns\n¯\n\\bar{s}\nand\nDQL\n+\nLag\n-\ns\n~\n\\tilde{s}\nalso have high maximum prediction errors in\nTable\n˜\n8\n. While for this specific setting in\nFig.\n˜\n16\n,\nForl\n(\nmax\n) and\nForl\n-\nDm\nare close to\nForl\n(DCM), although worse, we observe that across the test episodes,\nForl\n(DCM) outperforms\nForl\n(\nmax\n) and\nForl\n-\nDm\nin terms of maximum and mean error, demonstrating stability.\nTable 8\n:\nComparison of algorithm performance on error metrics.\nAlgorithm\nMinimum

Given the multimodal nature of the candidate state distributions, we conduct a sensitivity analysis on the number of denoiser samples, a shared hyperparameter for both\nmax\nand\nForl\n. We report results averaged over 5 random seeds across 25 tasks (\nantmaze\nand\nmaze2d\nwith\nreal-data-A,B,C,D,E\n). The results in\nFig.\n˜\n17\nindicate that our diffusion model’s performance remains consistent across varying sample sizes, demonstrating robustness to the number of candidate states generated. Notably, the\nDmbp\nalgorithm uses 50 denoiser samples.\nFigure 17\n:\nAverage normalized scores over 25 experiments with diffusion-generated sample sizes of 32 and 50, each conducted with 5 random seeds.\nThe results indicate that the diffusion model’s performance remains consistent across varying sample sizes, demonstrating robustness to the number of candidate states generated.\nAppendix I\nZero-shot Foundation Model and Time-Series Datasets\nWe extract the first two univariate series from five time‐series datasets:\nreal-data-A\n(\naustralian-electricity-demand\n)\n[\n73\n]\n,\nreal-data-B\n(\nelectricity\n)\n[\n74\n]\n,\nreal-data-C\n(\nelectricity-hourly\n)\n[\n73\n,\n74\n]\n,\nreal-data-D\n(\nelectricity-nips\n)\n[\n74\n,\n75\n]\nand\nreal-data-E\n(\nexchange-rate\n2\n2\n2\nhttps://github.com/laiguokun/multivariate-time-series-data\n)\n[\n76\n]\n,\n[\n73\n]\nall accessed via GluonTS\n[\n22\n,\n77\n]\n. Figure\n5\npresents the ground truth, forecast mean, and standard deviation from Lag-Llama\n[\n10\n]\nfor the first series of\nreal-data-A\nand\nreal-data-D\n; forecasts for the remaining series and domains are provided in Figure\n18\n.\nWe aim to capture a broad spectrum of scenarios for a comprehensive evaluation. For instance, the\nelectricity-hourly\ndataset consists of hourly electricity usage data from various consumers, while the\naustralian-electricity-demand\ndataset has 30-minute interval records of electricity demand across different Australian states. The\nexchange-rate\ndataset, on the other hand, includes daily exchange rates of multiple currencies, including those of Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, Switzerland, China, Japan, New Zealand, and Singapore.\nTo effectively represent diverse offset patterns in multiple directions, we apply feature scaling to the time-series data using a normalization\nx\nc\n′\n=\nx\n−\nx\n¯\nmax\n​\n(\nx\n)\n−\nmin\n​\n(\nx\n)\nx_{c}^{\\prime}=\\frac{x-\\bar{x}}{\\text{max}(x)-\\text{min}(x)}\nwhere sample mean\nx\n¯\n\\bar{x}\n,\nmin\n​\n(\nx\n)\n\\text{min}(x)\nand\nmax\n​\n(\nx\n)\n\\text{max}(x)\nare computed from the available data up to the context length. Furthermore, we scale these values using the minimum and maximum state values observed in the offline RL dataset\n[\n15\n]\nfor navigation and minimum and maximum state values of the initial state distribution at test time for manipulation\n[\n15\n]\n, ensuring that the experiments cover diverse observation spaces that can accurately represent a wide range of scenarios. We group our results in terms of time-series datasets in\nTable\n˜\n13\n.\nFigure 18\n:\nZero-shot forecasting results with Lag-Llama\n[\n10\n]\nfor first 2 time-series in univariate time-series datasets:\nreal-data-A\n(Australian-electricity-demand),\nreal-data-E\n(Exchange Rate),\nreal-data-B\n(Electricity),\nreal-data-C\n(Electricity Hourly),\nreal-data-D\n(Electricity Nips).\nI.1\nSensitivity of\nForl\nto Forecasting Errors\nTo analyze the sensitivity of\nForl\nto forecasting errors, we compare its performance against\nDQL\n+\nLag\n-\ns\n¯\n\\bar{s}\n, which only uses the forecaster’s predictions.\nTable\n˜\n11\npresents the average prediction error (\n↓\n\\downarrow\n) across all datasets in\nantmaze\nand\nmaze2d\nenvironments with 5 seeds.\nTable 11\n:\nSensitivity analysis of\nForl\nto forecasting errors.\nWe compare the average prediction error (\n↓\n\\downarrow\n) of our method against the\nDQL\n+\nLag\n-\ns\n¯\n\\bar{s}\nbaseline, which uses only the forecaster’s predictions.

J\nPreliminary Results for Affine Transformation with Uniform Scaling and Bias\nWe use the fourth series in each time-series domain to perform isotropic scaling for the dimensions affected by non-stationarity using a scaling factor of\nβ\n=\n0.5\n\\beta=0.5\n, with bias coming from the first two series, respectively. We apply feature scaling to time-series data with\nx\nc\n′\n=\n1\n−\nβ\n+\nβ\n⋅\nexp\n⁡\n(\nx\n−\nx\n¯\n2\n⋅\n(\nmax\n​\n(\nx\n)\n−\nmin\n​\n(\nx\n)\n)\n)\nx_{c}^{\\prime}=1-\\beta+\\beta\\cdot\\exp\\left(\\frac{x-\\bar{x}}{2\\cdot(\\text{max}(x)-\\text{min}(x))}\\right)\n. The offset scaling for the bias uses\nα\n=\n1\n\\alpha=1\n, which is the standard value in our experiments. As in the other ablations with scaling offsets, we use the\nDQL\npolicy.\nTable\n˜\n14\nshows that\nForl\noutperforms the baselines under this transformation. A large-scale analysis of more general transformations is left for future work.\nTable 14\n:\nPerformance under affine observation shifts.\nNormalized scores in\nmaze2d-large\nwith time-varying uniform scaling and bias.\nmaze2d-large\nDQL\nDQL\n+\nLag\n-\ns\n¯\n\\bar{s}\nForl\n(ours)\nreal-data-A\n5.9\n6.1\n39.7\nreal-data-B\n2.4\n1.6\n13.8\nreal-data-C\n2.2\n22.2\n32.9\nreal-data-D\n0.7\n10.7\n56.1\nreal-data-E\n-2.0\n-2.3\n27.5\nAverage\n1.8\n7.7\n34.0\nAppendix K\nOffline Reinforcement Learning Environments\nK.1\nD4RL\nWe use the standard D4RL\n[\n15\n]\noffline RL environments\n[\n15\n]\nwith no modifications during training, namely\nantmaze-medium-diverse\n,\nmaze2d-medium\n,\nantmaze-large-diverse\n,\nmaze2d-large\n, and\nantmaze-umaze-diverse\n, where initial states are randomized both in the evaluation environment and in the offline dataset.\nFig.\n˜\n19\nillustrates the environments used from the D4RL benchmark,\nkitchen-complete\n,\nantmaze-large-diverse\n,\nantmaze-medium-diverse\n,\nantmaze-umaze-diverse\n. The\nmaze2d-large\nand\nmaze2d-medium\nenvironments share the same maze configurations as\nantmaze-large-diverse\nand\nantmaze-medium-diverse\n, respectively.\nFor manipulation tasks, we train on the standard\nkitchen-complete\nenvironment. We sample the base joint angles from\nU\n​\n(\n[\n−\n1.5\n,\n0.17\n]\n)\nU([-1.5,0.17])\nand the shoulder‐joint angles from\nU\n​\n(\n[\n−\n1.78\n,\n−\n1.16\n]\n)\nU([-1.78,-1.16])\nwhich are set based on the minimum and maximum state space dimension intervals in the offline RL dataset to evaluate partial identifiability at test-time. The offsets affect the state dimensions associated with the base and shoulder joint angles.\nFigure 19\n:\nantmaze-large\n,\nantmaze-medium\n,\nantmaze-umaze\n(-v1) and\nkitchen-complete\nenvironments in D4RL benchmark\n[\n15\n]\n.\nK.2\nOGBench\nOGBench benchmark\n[\n21\n]\ncontains both standard and goal-conditioned offline reinforcement learning tasks. To induce non-stationarity at test time, we follow the procedure from our D4RL experiments and use time-series data from GluonTS\n[\n77\n,\n22\n]\n. For all tasks in\nFig.\n˜\n21\n, we use the default\nsingletask-v0\nvariant. We report results using the\nFQL\nalgorithm\n[\n23\n]\nwith its officially recommended hyperparameters. For the\nantmaze-large-navigate\nenvironment, we use the first two time series from the GluonTS\nreal-data-A,B,C,D,E\ndatasets and apply an offset scaling factor of\nα\n=\n0.5\n\\alpha=0.5\n. For\ncube-single-play\n, we apply offsets to the first 17 observation dimensions, which include all joint positions, joint velocities, and end effector variables (position and yaw), using the first 17 time series from each of the GluonTS\nreal-data-A,B,C,D,E\ndatasets. Because the\nreal-data-A\ndataset only has five time series, we cycle through them repeatedly until all 17 dimensions are covered. Across all\ncube-single-play\nexperiments, we use an offset scaling factor of\nα\n=\n0.25\n\\alpha=0.25\n.\nFigure 20\n:\nAverage normalized scores of\nForl\n(ours) and baselines for OGBench\nFigure 21\n:\ncube-single-play\nand\nantmaze-large-navigate\nenvironments in OGBench benchmark\n[\n21\n]\n.\nAppendix L\nImplementation Details\nDuring training, we use the original offline RL dataset\nwithout offsets\n. At test-time, the offsets affect the first two state dimensions, where each offset sequence is drawn from the first two univariate time-series from diverse datasets. The agent’s policy receives only the offset‐corrupted observations, with no direct access to the true underlying states throughout\nP\nP\nepisodes. The time-series forecasting model, given the past\nC\nC\nground-truth offsets\n(\nb\nj\n−\nC\n,\n⋯\n,\nb\nj\n−\n1\n)\n(b^{j-C},\\cdots,b^{j-1})\n, predicts the future offsets\n(\nb\nj\n,\n⋯\n,\nb\nj\n+\nP\n)\n(b^{j},\\cdots,b^{j+P})\nduring testing.\nForl\nleverages these predictions and in-episode experience to dynamically adapt to unknown external perturbations. All experiments use 5 random seeds, except for (i) the preliminary affine-transformation results (\nAppendix\n˜\nJ\n) and (ii) the focused error analysis across all evaluation episodes for the task shown in\nFig.\n˜\n16\nwith results reported in\nTable\n˜\n8\n.\nWe select the hyperparameters in Table\nLABEL:tab:combined_hyperparameters\nbased on the validation loss of the\nForl\ndiffusion model in D4RL and OGbench standard offline RL datasets. The validation loss is computed using the\nDm\nloss function in Eq.\n4\n. Hyperparameter optimization was conducted using a grid search, with the following ranges for\nmaze2d\nand\nantmaze\n: diffusion timesteps\nN\n=\n{\n10\n,\n20\n}\nN=\\{10,20\\}\n, number of hidden layers following the Temporal Unet model\n#\n​\nl\n​\na\n​\ny\n​\ne\n​\nr\n​\ns\n=\n{\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n}\n\\#layers=\\{1,2,3\\}\n, window size\nw\n=\n{\n128\n,\n256\n}\nw=\\{128,256\\}\n, and learning rate\nl\n​\nr\n=\n{\n0.0004\n,\n0.0006\n,\n0.0009\n}\nlr=\\{0.0004,0.0006,0.0009\\}\n. For the\nkitchen-complete\nand\ncube-single-play\nembedding dimension\n=\n{\n64\n,\n128\n}\n\\textit{embedding dimension}=\\{64,128\\}\n, learning rates\nl\n​\nr\n=\n{\n0.0004\n,\n0.0009\n}\nlr=\\{0.0004,0.0009\\}\nand\nw\n=\n{\n32\n,\n64\n}\nw=\\{32,64\\}\nare used for the grid search.\nThe architecture of our\nForl\nModel is a noise prediction conditional TemporalUnet diffusion model\n[\n78\n,\n39\n,\n3\n]\n. Different from the architecture used in\n[\n3\n]\n, we concatenate each element in\n𝝉\n(\nt\n,\nw\n)\n\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{(t,w)}\nwith\n𝒔\nt\n(\nn\n)\n\\boldsymbol{s}_{t}^{(n)}\nand feed it to our model without additional encoders, using the diffusion timestep embedding in the Residual Temporal Blocks. For the TemporalUnet architecture, we concatenate the Unet model output with the time-embedding before feeding it to fully connected layers, particularly in the antmaze environments due to the large input size. The set of hyperparameters is provided in Table\nLABEL:tab:combined_hyperparameters\n. Although the\nForl\nconditional diffusion model is specifically utilized for time-dependent offsets in the first two dimensions of the state vector, it is trained for general-purpose state prediction, enabling it to predict all dimensions of the state in\nmaze2d\n,\nantmaze\n, and OGBench environments. This approach is taken because we do not assume prior knowledge of the evaluation environment.\nThe method for setting seeds involves a function that initializes the seed across all relevant libraries (PyTorch, CUDA, NumPy, Gym Environment, and Python’s random module) to ensure the replicability of results. We use the open source implementation of\nDmbp\n3\n3\n3\nhttps://github.com/zhyang2226/DMBP/tree/main\nwith the suggested hyperparameters\n[\n56\n]\n, and the pretrained Lag-Llama\n4\n4\n4\nhttps://github.com/time-series-foundation-models/Lag-Llama\nmodel\n[\n10\n]\n.\nAppendix M\nExperiments compute resources\nExperiments were primarily conducted on an HPC cluster with NVIDIA A100 GPUs (40GB HBM2, PCIe 4.0/NVLink interconnect) and AMD EPYC 7302 CPUs (32 cores, 1TB RAM, 3TB local SSD), as well as on a workstation with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 (24GB GDDR6X), 128GB RAM, and a 2TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD. A small portion of the experiments also ran on a cluster equipped with 4x NVIDIA V100 GPUs (16GB NVLink), 2x Intel Xeon Gold 6248R CPUs, and 384GB RAM. The total compute for published results is approximately 7,300 GPU-hours; additional failed and preliminary runs total approximately 1,500 GPU-hours.\nTable 15\n:\nHyperparameters

  "preview_text": "Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a promising avenue for training policies from pre-collected datasets when gathering additional interaction data is infeasible. However, existing offline RL methods often assume stationarity or only consider synthetic perturbations at test time, assumptions that often fail in real-world scenarios characterized by abrupt, time-varying offsets. These offsets can lead to partial observability, causing agents to misperceive their true state and degrade performance. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Forecasting in Non-stationary Offline RL (FORL), a framework that unifies (i) conditional diffusion-based candidate state generation, trained without presupposing any specific pattern of future non-stationarity, and (ii) zero-shot time-series foundation models. FORL targets environments prone to unexpected, potentially non-Markovian offsets, requiring robust agent performance from the onset of each episode. Empirical evaluations on offline RL benchmarks, augmented with real-world time-series data to simulate realistic non-stationarity, demonstrate that FORL consistently improves performance compared to competitive baselines. By integrating zero-shot forecasting with the agent's experience, we aim to bridge the gap between offline RL and the complexities of real-world, non-stationary environments.\n\nForecasting in Offline Reinforcement Learning for Non-stationary Environments\nSuzan Ece Ada\n1,2\nGeorg Martius\n2\nEmre Ugur\n1\nErhan Oztop\n3,4\n1\nBogazici University, Türkiye\n2\nUniversity of Tübingen, Germany\n3\nOzyegin University, Türkiye\n4\nOsaka University, Japan\nece.ada@bogazici.edu.tr\nAbstract\nOffline Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a promising avenue for training policies from pre-collected datasets when gathering additional interaction data is infeasible.

      "answer": "## Forecasting in Offline Reinforcement Learning for Non-stationary Environments\n\n这篇论文提出了一种名为 **Forl** 的新框架，旨在解决离线强化学习（Offline RL）在非平稳环境中的一个关键挑战。\n\n### 核心问题：非平稳环境下的状态感知偏移\n\n该研究针对的是一个现实世界中普遍存在但现有方法处理不足的问题：\n\n1.  **场景设定**：智能体在一个**非平稳（Non-stationary）** 环境中部署。具体来说，环境的**观测函数（Observation Function）** 会随时间发生未知的、突变的偏移。\n2.  **问题本质**：这种偏移表现为每个episode开始时，真实状态 `s` 和观测到的状态 `o` 之间存在一个未知的、恒定的加性偏置 `b^j`，即 `o = s + b^j`。这个偏置 `b^j` 在episode内是固定的，但在不同episode间会根据某种复杂的、可能是非马尔可夫的时间序列模式变化。\n3.  **核心挑战**：\n    *   **部分可观测性 (POMDP)**：由于偏置 `b^j` 对智能体完全隐藏，它无法直接知道自己的真实位置或状态，导致了部分可观测性问题。\n    *   **零样本适应 (Zero-shot Adaptation)**：训练时的数据集是在平稳（无偏置）环境下收集的。测试时，智能体必须在不进行任何在线交互和重新训练的情况下，应对这些全新的、未见过的偏置模式。\n    *   **传统方法的局限**：现有的鲁棒离线RL方法通常假设扰动是平滑的（如高斯噪声）或对抗性的，而难以处理这种由真实世界时间序列驱动的、突变的、episode级的系统性偏移。\n\n简而言之，论文想解决的问题是：**如何让一个在“理想”数据上训练好的离线RL策略，无需重新训练，就能在部署时面对因传感器漂移、校准误差等导致的、未知且不断变化的系统性观测偏移？**\n\n---\n\n### 核心创新点与解决方案\n\n为了解决上述问题，作者提出了 **Forl (Forecasting in Non-stationary Offline RL)** 框架。其核心创新在于**巧妙地融合了两种强大的模型，并设计了一个轻量级的融合机制**。\n\n#### 1. 双源信息融合架构\n\n`Forl` 的核心思想是利用两个独立的信息来源来共同估计真实状态 `s_t`：\n\n-   **来源一：前瞻性预测 (Prospective Forecasting)**\n    -   **组件**：使用一个**零样本时间序列基础模型 (Zero-Shot Time-Series Foundation Model)**，例如 Lag-Llama。\n    -   **作用**：基于过去episode的偏置历史 `(b^{j-C}, ..., b^{j-1})`，预测未来episode的偏置 `b^j`。这提供了一个对偏置的**先验估计**。\n\n-   **来源二：回溯性推理 (Retrospective Reasoning)**\n    -   **组件**：一个**条件扩散模型 (Conditional Diffusion Model, Forl-Dm)**。\n    -   **作用**：在episode内部，利用智能体自身的经验（动作 `a` 和观测变化 `Δo`）来推断可能的真实状态。例如，在迷宫中，如果智能体连续向北移动并撞墙，那么它的候选位置就只能是所有墙壁以南三步的位置。扩散模型能捕捉这种多模态的可能性分布。\n\n#### 2. 创新性融合模块：维度最近匹配 (DCM)\n\n这是 `Forl` 框架的关键技术亮点。它将上述两个来源的信息进行有效融合。\n\n```python\n# DCM (Dimension-wise Closest Match) 伪代码逻辑\ndef DCM(diffusion_candidates, forecasted_states):\n    # diffusion_candidates: {s_t^(0)}_k, 来自扩散模型的k个候选状态\n    # forecasted_states: {ŝ_t^b}_l, 来自时间序列模型的l个预测状态\n    \n    final_estimate = []\n    for dimension_d in range(n_dimensions): # 遍历每个状态维度\n        best_forecast_idx = None\n        min_distance = float('inf')\n        \n        for j in range(l): # 遍历每个预测状态\n            # 找到在当前维度d上，与任意一个扩散候选最接近的预测状态\n            closest_candidate_dist = min( |x_i,d - y_j,d| for i in k )\n            if closest_candidate_dist < min_distance:\n                min_distance = closest_candidate_dist\n                best_forecast_idx = j\n                \n        # 选择该预测状态在维度d上的值作为最终估计\n        final_estimate.append(y_best_forecast_idx,d)\n    \n    return final_estimate\n```\n\n**DCM的优势**：\n-   **非参数化**：不需要学习额外的参数。\n-   **稳健性**：它不依赖于预测均值的准确性，而是寻找与扩散模型生成的“合理区域”最匹配的预测样本，从而避免了因预测偏差导致的灾难性错误。\n-   **高效**：计算开销小，适合在线推理。\n\n#### 3. 整体工作流程 (Algorithm 1)\n\n1.  **初始化**：在episode开始时，仅使用时间序列模型预测的平均偏置来修正初始观测。\n2.  **动态更新**：随着episode进行，当有足够的历史 (`t > w`) 后，启动扩散模型生成候选状态。\n3.  **融合决策**：使用DCM模块，结合扩散模型的候选状态和时间序列模型的预测状态，得到更精确的当前状态估计 `~s_t`。\n4.  **执行动作**：将估计出的状态 `~s_t` 输入给预训练好的离线RL策略（如DQL），以选择动作。\n\n---\n\n### 总结\n\n**Forl** 框架通过以下方式解决了非平稳环境下的离线RL问题：\n\n-   **统一了预测与决策**：首次将零样本时间序列预测与离线RL决策在测试时无缝结合。\n-   **实现了真正的零样本适应**：无需针对特定的非平稳模式进行再训练或超参数调整。\n-   **引入了新颖的融合机制**：提出的 **DCM** 模块是一种简单、高效且非常稳健的多源信息融合方法，显著优于其他融合策略（如加权平均、最大似然）。\n\n实验结果表明，`Forl` 在多个基准任务上，尤其是在处理来自真实世界数据集（如电力需求、汇率）的复杂非平稳性时，性能远超基线方法，成功地弥合了离线RL理论与复杂现实应用之间的鸿沟。",

      "answer": "## Forecasting in Offline Reinforcement Learning for Non-stationary Environments: 发展脉络与创新演进\n\n该论文《Forecasting in Offline Reinforcement Learning for Non-stationary Environments》（简称 **Forl**）提出了一种新颖的框架，旨在解决离线强化学习（Offline RL）在非平稳环境中的核心挑战——**观测函数的时变偏移**。其创新并非凭空而来，而是建立在多个研究方向的坚实基础之上，并对现有方法进行了关键性的融合与超越。\n\n以下梳理了该工作所依赖和改进的几个核心发展方向：\n\n---\n\n### 1. 非平稳环境下的鲁棒离线RL (Robust Offline RL)\n\n这是最直接的前序工作，主要关注如何让在“干净”数据上训练的策略，在测试时面对被破坏的观测（如噪声、对抗性攻击）时仍能保持稳健。\n\n- **代表工作**: `Dmbp` (Zhihe & Xu, 2024) 和 `Rorl` (Yang et al., 2022)。\n- **核心思想**:\n    - `Dmbp`: 使用扩散模型作为去噪器，从被污染的观测中恢复出接近真实的状态。\n    - `Rorl`: 通过保守平滑机制，学习一个对邻近状态变化不敏感的策略，从而抵御小扰动。\n- **局限性**: 这些方法通常假设扰动是**瞬时的、随机的或遵循简单分布**（如高斯噪声）。它们无法处理**系统性、持续整个episode且随时间演变的偏移**（如每天校准的机器人关节偏差）。\n- **Forl 的改进**:\n    - **问题定义升级**: Forl 将问题从“**瞬时噪声**”提升到“**持续的、episode级的、由真实世界时间序列驱动的非马尔可夫式偏移**”。这更贴近工业界的真实场景（如传感器漂移、周期性校准）。\n    - **引入预测能力**: Forl 不仅“去噪”，还主动“**预测未来**”。它利用历史偏移的时间序列模式来预判下一个episode的偏移量，而不仅仅是被动地修正当前的观测。\n\n```python\n# 对比伪代码：传统鲁棒方法 vs. Forl\n# 传统方法 (e.g., Dmbp)\ndef traditional_robust_step(observation):\n    # 被动去噪：输入当前脏观测，输出干净状态\n    clean_state = denoiser(observation) \n    action = policy(clean_state)\n    return action\n\n# Forl 方法\ndef forl_step(observation, episode_history_offsets):\n    # 主动预测 + 动态修正\n    forecasted_offset = time_series_forecaster(episode_history_offsets) \n    predicted_state = observation - forecasted_offset\n    \n    # 结合在线经验进行动态精修\n    if enough_experience_in_episode():\n        candidate_states = diffusion_model(observation_deltas, actions)\n        refined_state = DCM_fusion(candidate_states, predicted_state)\n        final_state = refined_state\n    else:\n        final_state = predicted_state\n        \n    action = policy(final_state)\n    return action\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. 扩散模型在RL中的应用 (Diffusion Models in RL)\n\n扩散模型因其强大的生成能力和对多模态分布的建模优势，被广泛应用于RL的各个层面。\n\n- **代表工作**:\n    - **策略表示**: `Diffusion Q-Learning (DQL)` (Wang et al., 2023) 使用扩散模型来参数化策略，以更好地模仿行为策略的多峰特性。\n    - **规划与数据合成**: `Janner et al.` (2022) 使用扩散模型进行轨迹规划。\n- **核心思想**: 利用扩散模型的逆向过程，从噪声中逐步生成高质量的样本（动作、状态、轨迹）。\n- **Forl 的创新性应用**:\n    - **新任务**: Forl 是首个将条件扩散模型用于**状态估计/信念更新**（state estimation/belief update）的工作。\n    - **独特输入**: 其扩散模型的条件不是当前状态，而是**过去一段时间内的动作-效果序列** `(Δo, a)`。这使得模型能够学习“如果我执行这些动作，我的可能位置在哪里？”这一物理动力学知识。\n    - **输出多模态**: 模型输出的是**一组候选状态** `{s_t^(0)}_k`，而非单一状态。这完美捕捉了部分可观测性带来的不确定性（例如，在迷宫中，根据移动历史，你可能在四个角落之一）。\n\n---\n\n### 3. 时间序列预测与零样本基础模型 (Zero-shot Time Series Foundation Models)\n\n这是一个独立但至关重要的领域，为Forl提供了“预见未来”的眼睛。\n\n- **代表工作**: `Lag-Llama` (Rasul et al., 2023)。\n- **核心思想**: 训练一个通用的、大规模的时间序列基础模型，使其能够在没有针对特定数据集微调的情况下，对新的时间序列进行准确预测（即“零样本”预测）。\n- **Forl 的整合与创新**:\n    - **跨领域融合**: Forl 成功地将金融、电力等领域的时间序列预测技术，无缝集成到了RL的决策框架中。\n    - **提供先验信息**: 它利用 `Lag-Llama` 对**历史episode偏移量**的预测，为当前episode提供了一个关于初始偏移的“最佳猜测”或先验信念。\n    - **实现零样本适应**: 整个框架无需在非平稳环境下进行任何再训练，完全依靠预训练好的预测模型和离线RL数据，实现了对未知非平稳模式的即时适应。\n\n---\n\n### 4. 状态估计与部分可观测性 (State Estimation and POMDPs)\n\n当环境因偏移而变得部分可观测时，传统的POMDP解决方案（如粒子滤波）需要维护一个完整的信念状态。\n\n- **传统方法**: 卡尔曼滤波、粒子滤波等，通过递归贝叶斯更新来维持状态的后验分布。\n- **Forl 的简化与高效替代**:\n    - **轻量化信念**: Forl 并未显式维护一个复杂的概率密度函数。它通过两个来源构建信念：\n        1.  **外部预测**: 来自时间序列模型的“前瞻性”信念。\n        2.  **内部推理**: 来自扩散模型的“回顾性”信念（基于自身行动的效果）。\n    - **创新的融合机制 (DCM)**: 提出了 **Dimension-wise Closest Match (DCM)** 这一轻量级、非参数化的融合策略。它巧妙地结合了单峰预测（来自时间序列）和多峰候选（来自扩散模型），计算效率远高于标准的贝叶斯更新。\n\n---\n\n### 总结：Forl 的核心创新与价值\n\n| 方向 | 前序工作 | Forl 的改进 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **鲁棒离线RL** | 处理瞬时、随机噪声 (`Dmbp`, `Rorl`) | 处理**持续的、episode级的、由真实时间序列驱动的系统性偏移** |\n| **扩散模型应用** | 用于策略、规划 | 首创用于**基于动作-效果的状态信念生成**，输出**多模态候选状态** |\n| **时间序列预测** | 独立的预测任务 | **零样本集成**，为RL agent 提供**未来偏移的前瞻性预测** |\n| **状态估计** | 复杂的贝叶斯滤波 | 提出**轻量级的DCM融合模块**，高效结合内外部信息 |\n\n**最终价值**: Forl 构建了一个**统一、模块化、零样本适应**的框架，成功弥合了离线RL与复杂现实世界之间的鸿沟。它不再假设环境是静态的或扰动是简单的，而是拥抱了非平稳性，并利用预测和生成模型的力量，使智能体能够在部署之初就具备应对未知、系统性变化的强大韧性。",

      "answer": "## **Suzan Ece Ada 的前作与本文《Forl》的对比分析**\n\n根据提供的论文信息，作者 **Suzan Ece Ada** 在本篇工作（`Forl`）之前至少发表过两篇相关研究。下表总结了她的主要前作，并详细阐述了 `Forl` 相对于这些工作的具体改进和技术创新。\n\n```markdown\n| 论文标题 | 发表年份/会议 | 核心方法 | 主要贡献与局限性 | 与 `Forl` 的关键区别 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Unsupervised Meta-Testing with Conditional Neural Processes for Hybrid Meta-Reinforcement Learning** | 2024 / IEEE RA-L | 使用 **条件神经过程 (CNP)** 进行元测试。在训练时学习一个可以泛化的先验，在测试时通过少量交互快速适应新任务。 | 提出了一种无监督的元测试框架，能利用历史经验进行快速自适应。但其核心假设是**需要在线交互**来收集测试时的数据以更新信念。 | **1. 范式根本不同**：`Forl` 是 **完全离线 (offline)** 的，**不依赖任何在线交互**。它解决的是“无法试错”的场景。<br>**2. 技术路线革新**：用 **扩散模型 + 零样本预测** 替代了 CNP。扩散模型能生成更丰富的多模态候选状态，而零样本时间序列模型直接从宏观趋势预测未来偏移。 |\n| **Diffusion Policies for Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Offline Reinforcement Learning** | 2024 / IEEE RA-L | 将 **扩散模型** 应用于策略本身，使其能够更好地处理分布外 (OOD) 状态。 | 探索了扩散模型在提升离线RL泛化能力上的潜力，证明了其表达力优于传统高斯策略。但该工作仍假设环境是**静态可观测**的，未考虑观测函数本身的非平稳性。 | **1. 解决问题的层面不同**：前作关注**策略的鲁棒性**，即如何让策略在遇到没见过的状态时表现更好。`Forl` 则关注**状态估计的鲁棒性**，即如何在观测被系统性扭曲的情况下，推断出真实的、正确的状态。<br>**2. 模块化创新**：`Forl` 并没有改变策略本身，而是作为一个**即插即用的前端模块**，为任何现有策略（如DQL, FQL, TD3+BC等）提供更准确的状态输入，从而间接提升了策略性能。这是一种更通用的解决方案。 |\n```\n\n---\n\n### **`Forl` 相对于前作的核心改进与技术创新详解**\n\n`Forl` 框架并非对前作的简单延续，而是一次针对特定挑战（**非平稳环境下的部分可观测性**）的范式级创新。其主要改善体现在以下几个方面：\n\n#### **1. 从“在线适应”到“纯离线预见”的范式转变**\n*   **前作 (`Ada and Ugur, 2024`)**: 其核心思想是“**边做边学**”。代理在测试时会进行少量探索，收集数据，并利用这些新数据（通过CNP）来更新自己对当前任务的认知。\n*   **`Forl`**: 实现了“**未卜先知**”。它彻底摒弃了测试时的任何交互需求。其核心洞察是：未来的偏移模式可以从**过去偏移的历史记录**中被**预测**出来。这使得 `Forl` 能够在部署后立即、无需任何代价地应对全新的、未知的非平稳性，极大地提升了在安全敏感或成本高昂场景下的实用性。\n\n#### **2. 引入“零样本时间序列基础模型”作为外部知识源**\n*   **前作 (`Ada et al., 2024`)**: 依赖于从**同一类任务**的历史数据中学习到的统计规律（OOD泛化），其知识来源局限于训练集内部。\n*   **`Forl`**: 开创性地引入了 **Lag-Llama** 这样的零样本时间序列大模型作为独立的、强大的**外部预测器**。这个模块：\n    *   **解耦了学习目标**：它专门负责预测未来的时间序列模式，而不关心具体的RL任务细节。\n    *   **具备零样本能力**：即使面对从未见过的、复杂的现实世界时间序列（如电力需求、汇率波动），也能做出合理的预测，极大地增强了系统的泛化能力和适用范围。\n    *   **提供了前瞻性信息**：这是 `Forl` 最大的优势，它不再是被动地响应变化，而是主动地**预见并纠正**未来的感知偏差。\n\n#### **3. 设计“双源信息融合”机制，实现动态状态估计**\n`Forl` 的核心技术在于其精巧的 **“双流”状态估计架构**，这是对前作技术路线的根本性升级。\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[历史偏移数据] --> B(零样本FM<br>Lag-Llama)\n    C[当前episode的 Δo, a] --> D(Forl-Dm<br>条件扩散模型)\n    B --> E[预测的偏移 b^]\n    D --> F[候选真实状态 s^(0)]\n    E --> G[DCM融合模块]\n    F --> G\n    G --> H[最终状态估计 s~]\n```\n\n*   **第一流：基于历史的全局预测 (Global Forecasting)**\n    *   **来源**：零样本时间序列模型 (Lag-Llama)。\n    *   **作用**：提供对未来偏移量的**先验估计**。这是一个单峰、确定性的预测，代表了宏观趋势。\n\n*   **第二流：基于经验的局部推理 (Local Retrospection)**\n    *   **来源**：`Forl-Dm` 条件扩散模型。\n    *   **作用**：利用当前episode内的动作-效果序列 `(Δo, a)`，结合训练时学到的动力学知识，生成一组**多模态的候选真实状态**。这相当于在说：“根据我刚才的操作，我的真实位置可能在以下这几个区域”。\n\n*   **融合机制：维度最近匹配 (DCM)**\n    *   **创新点**：`Forl` 提出了轻量级且高效的 **DCM** 算法来融合这两股信息。\n    *   **工作原理**：它不是简单地取平均或加权，而是为每个状态维度，找到“**最有可能与我的实际经验（候选状态）相吻合**”的那个预测偏移样本。\n    *   **优势**：这种非参数搜索方式非常稳健，避免了因预测均值有偏而导致的整体估计失败。它巧妙地将“外部预测”和“内部经验”结合起来，实现了比单一方法更准确、更稳定的状态估计。\n\n#### **4. 模块化设计，实现“即插即用”**\n*   **前作**：通常需要修改策略网络的结构或训练流程。\n*   **`Forl`**: 其最大的实际价值在于其**模块化**。`Forl` 框架位于策略之前，作为一个**状态预处理器**。这意味着：\n    *   **无需重新训练**：可以直接应用于任何已有的、训练好的离线RL策略（如DQL, FQL, TD3+BC等）。\n    *   **易于集成**：只需将 `Forl` 输出的修正后状态 `s~` 输入给原策略即可。\n    *   **广泛适用性**：实验部分成功验证了 `Forl` 可以显著提升多种不同类型策略的性能，证明了其作为通用增强工具的有效性。\n\n### **总结**\n\n综上所述，`Forl` 框架是 Suzan Ece Ada 在其前作基础上的一次重大飞跃。它不再局限于策略内部的优化或依赖在线交互，而是构建了一个**前瞻性的、模块化的、双源驱动的智能体**。通过整合**零样本时间序列预测**和**基于扩散模型的多模态状态推理**，`Forl` 成功解决了在非平稳环境下“**看不见、摸不着却必须立刻正确行动**”的核心难题，为离线强化学习走向复杂的真实世界应用开辟了一条新的道路。",

      "answer": "## 论文的主要局限性与未来改进方向\n\n该论文提出了一种创新的框架 `Forl`，用于解决非平稳环境下的离线强化学习问题。然而，作者在结论部分明确指出了其当前工作的主要局限性，并提出了相应的未来研究方向。\n\n### 主要局限性\n\n1.  **对扰动类型的强假设（Additive Perturbations）**：\n    *   这是论文最核心的局限性。`Forl` 框架的核心机制依赖于一个关键假设：观测函数的变化是**加性的**（additive），即 `o_t = s_t + b^j`，其中偏移量 `b^j` 在每个episode内是恒定的。\n    *   这个假设虽然能有效处理传感器校准漂移、数据聚合偏差等现实场景，但极大地限制了方法的通用性。它无法处理更复杂的、非加性的状态变换，例如：\n        *   **仿射变换 (Affine Transformations)**：如 `o_t = A * s_t + b`，其中 `A` 是一个缩放或旋转矩阵。\n        *   **非线性变换 (Non-linear Transformations)**：如 `o_t = sin(s_t)` 或由神经网络定义的复杂映射。\n        *   **结构化缺失 (Structured Missingness)**：某些维度的数据完全丢失或被遮蔽。\n\n2.  **对零样本预测器性能的依赖**：\n    *   `Forl` 的性能在很大程度上取决于所使用的零样本时间序列基础模型（如Lag-Llama）的预测准确性。如果真实世界的时间序列模式极其复杂或不可预测，预测误差会直接影响最终的状态估计和策略性能。\n\n3.  **扩散模型训练的计算开销**：\n    *   尽管推理过程相对高效，但训练条件扩散模型本身是一个计算密集型任务，需要大量的时间和GPU资源。\n\n### 未来的改进方向\n\n作者在结论中明确提出了未来的研究方向，这直接针对了上述局限性：\n\n1.  **扩展到更一般的观测变换**：\n    *   **首要目标**：将 `Forl` 的框架从目前的**加性扰动**推广到**更一般的观测变换**。这意味着需要设计新的生成模型或状态估计机制，能够处理仿射变换、非线性变换甚至未知的函数映射。\n    *   **潜在方法**：可以探索使用更强大的生成模型（如基于流的模型Flow Models或自回归模型）来直接建模复杂的 `s -> o` 映射，或者引入可学习的变换参数。\n\n2.  **增强对预测误差的鲁棒性**：\n    *   可以设计更鲁棒的融合策略（DCM的替代方案），使其对预测模块的输出不那么敏感，从而降低整体系统对单一模块失败的脆弱性。\n\n3.  **探索在线适应机制**：\n    *   虽然 `Forl` 强调“零次”（zero-shot）和无需重新训练，但在安全允许的情况下，可以探索轻量级的在线微调机制，在部署后利用少量交互数据进一步优化状态估计模型。\n\n4.  **处理更高维和更复杂的非平稳性**：\n    *   当前实验主要关注少数几个维度的偏移。未来的工作可以研究如何应对所有状态维度同时发生复杂、高维非平稳变化的情况。\n\n综上所述，该论文的**主要局限性在于其对加性偏移的强假设**，而**最直接且重要的未来方向就是突破这一限制，将方法推广到更一般、更复杂的观测空间变换中**。",
