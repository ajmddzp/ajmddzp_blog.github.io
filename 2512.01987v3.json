However, existing offline RL methods often assume stationarity or only consider synthetic perturbations at test time, assumptions that often fail in real-world scenarios characterized by abrupt, time-varying offsets. These offsets can lead to partial observability, causing agents to misperceive their true state and degrade performance. To overcome this challenge, we introduce\nF\norecasting in Non-stationary\nO\nffline\nRL\n(\nForl\n), a framework that unifies (i) conditional diffusion-based candidate state generation, trained without presupposing any specific pattern of future non-stationarity, and (ii) zero-shot time-series foundation models.\nForl\ntargets environments prone to unexpected, potentially non-Markovian offsets, requiring robust agent performance from the onset of each episode. Empirical evaluations on offline RL benchmarks, augmented with real-world time-series data to simulate realistic non-stationarity, demonstrate that\nForl\nconsistently improves performance compared to competitive baselines. By integrating zero-shot forecasting with the agent’s experience, we aim to bridge the gap between offline RL and the complexities of real-world, non-stationary environments.\nFigure 1\n:\nSetting.\nThe agent does not know its location in the environment because its perception is offset every episode\nj\nj\nby an unknown offset\nb\nj\nb^{j}\n(only vertical offsets are illustrated).\nForl\nleverages historical offset data and offline RL data (from a stationary phase) to forecast and correct for new offsets at test time. Ground-truth offsets (\n,\n) are hidden throughout the evaluation episodes.\n1\nIntroduction\nOffline Reinforcement Learning (RL) leverages static datasets to avoid costly or risky online interactions\n[\n1\n,\n2\n]\n. Yet, agents trained on fully observable states often fail when deployed with noisy or corrupted observations. While robust offline RL methods address test-time perturbations, such as sensor noise or adversarial attacks\n[\n3\n]\n, a critical gap persists in addressing non-stationarity within the observation function—a challenge that fundamentally alters the agent’s perception of the environment over time.\nPrior\nonline algorithms\nthat consider the scope of non-stationarity as the observation function focus on learning agent morphologies\n[\n4\n]\nand generalization in Block MDPs\n[\n5\n]\n. While this scope of non-stationarity holds significant potential for real-world applications\n[\n6\n]\n, it remains underexplored. We focus on the episodic evolution of the observation function at test-time in offline RL. In our setup, each dimension of an agent’s state is influenced by an unknown, time-dependent constant additive offset that remains fixed within a single operational interval (an “episode”). This leads to a stream of evolving observation functions\n[\n7\n]\n, extending across multiple future episodes,\nwhere the offsets remain hidden throughout the prediction window\n. For instance, industrial robots might apply a daily calibration offset to each joint, while sensors can exhibit a deviation until the next scheduled recalibration. Similarly, in healthcare or finance, data may be partially aggregated or withheld to comply with regulations, effectively obscuring finer-grained variations and leaving a single offset as the dominant factor per episode. By only storing these representative offsets, we circumvent the challenges of continuous interaction buffers in bandwidth-constrained or privacy-sensitive environments. Because the offset can differ across state dimensions (e.g., different sensor or actuation channels), each state dimension can be affected by a different unknown bias that stays constant for that episode but evolves differently across episodes. Approaches that assume predefined perturbations can struggle with these abrupt, episodic shifts because such offsets violate the typical assumption of smoothly varying observation functions. Frequent retraining, hyperparameter optimization, or extensive online adaptation to new observation function evolution patterns are costly, risky (due to trial-and-error in safety-critical settings), and may be infeasible if these patterns no longer reflect assumptions made during training. By separating offset data (episodic calibration values) from the massive replay buffers, a zero-shot forecasting-based approach can anticipate each new offset from the beginning of the episode without requiring policy updates or making assumptions on task evolution at test time\n[\n8\n]\n. Modeling these multidimensional additive offsets as stable, per-episode constants presents a robust and efficient way to handle time-varying conditions in non-stationary environments where the evolution of tasks follows a non-Markovian, time-series pattern\n[\n9\n]\n, mitigating the risks of online exploration.\nFigure 2\n:\nOverview of the proposed\nForl\nframework at test-time. The observations are processed by both the trajectory buffer and the time-series\nforecasting foundation\nmodule\n[\n10\n]\n. Observation changes and actions sampled from the\npolicy\n(\nΔ\n​\no\n,\na\n)\n(\\Delta o,a)\n, are stored in the trajectory buffer. The\ndiffusion model\ngenerates candidate states\n{\n𝒔\nt\n(\n0\n)\n}\nk\n\\{\\boldsymbol{s}_{t}^{(0)}\\}_{k}\nconditioned on\n𝝉\n(\nt\n,\nw\n)\n\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{(t,w)}\n. The\ncandidate selection\nmodule then generates the estimated\ns\n~\nt\n\\tilde{s}_{t}\n.\nWe consider an offline RL setting during training where we have only access to a standard offline RL dataset collected from a stationary environment\n[\n3\n]\nwith fully observable states. Initial data may be collected under near-ideal conditions and then gradually affected by wear, tear, or other natural shifts—even as the underlying physical laws (dynamics) remain unchanged. At test time, however, we evaluate in a non-stationary environment where both the observation function and the observation space change due to time-dependent external factors. This setup can be interpreted as environments shifting along observation space dimensions while the initial state of the agent is sampled from a uniform distribution over the state space. A simplified version of this setup for an offset affecting only one dimension of the state is illustrated in Figure\n1\n. Here, the agent “knows” it is in a maze but does not know where it is in the maze. Furthermore,\nit will remain uncertain of its location across all episodes at test-time\n, as in every episode, a new offset leads to a systematic misalignment between perceived and actual positions. Importantly, these offsets may not conform to Gaussian or Markovian assumptions; instead, they may stem directly from complex, real-world time-series data\n[\n9\n]\nand remain constant throughout each episode. As a result, standard noise-driven or parametric state-estimation techniques, which typically rely on smoothly varying or randomly perturbed functions, cannot reliably identify these persistent, episode-wide offsets that are not available after the episode terminates. While zero-shot forecasting can adjust observation offsets, its performance depends on the forecaster’s accuracy. Similarly, integrating zero-shot forecasting into a model-based offline RL approach\n[\n3\n]\ncan underperform when real-world offsets deviate from predefined assumptions about future observation functions. Our approach uses the insight that the belief of the true states can be refined from a sequence of actions and effects. For instance, in maze navigation, if an agent misjudges its location and hits a wall, analyzing its actions and delta observations leading to the collision can provide evidence for likely locations within the maze.\nWe propose the\nF\norecasting in Non-stationary\nO\nffline\nRL\n(\nForl\n) framework (Figure\n2\n) for test-time adaptation in non-stationary environments where the observation function is perturbed by an arbitrary time-series.\nOur framework has two main ingredients:\nforecasting offsets with a zero-shot time-series forecasting model\n[\n10\n]\nfrom past episode offsets (ground truth offsets after the episode terminates are not accessible at test-time) and\na within-episode update of the state estimation using a conditional diffusion model\n[\n11\n]\ntrained on offline stationary data.\nContributions.\nWe unify the strengths of probabilistic forecasting and decision-making under uncertainty to enable continuous adaptation when the environment diverges from predictions. Consequently, our framework:\n(1)\naccommodates future offsets\nwithout assuming specific non-stationarity patterns during training\n, eliminating the need for retraining and hyperparameter tuning when the agent encounters new, unseen non-stationary patterns at test time, and\n(2)\ntargets non-trivial non-stationarities at test time without requiring environment interaction or knowledge of POMDPs during training\n.\n(3)\nForl\nintroduces a novel, modular framework combining a conditional diffusion model (\nForl\n-\nDm\n) for multimodal belief generation with a lightweight Dimension-wise Closest Match (DCM) fusion strategy, validated by extensive experiments on no-access to past offsets, policy-agnostic plug-and-play, offset magnitude-scaling, and inter/intra-episode drifts.\n(4)\nWe propose a novel benchmark that integrates offsets from real-world time-series datasets with standard offline RL benchmarks and demonstrate that\nForl\nconsistently outperforms baseline methods.\nBackground: Diffusion Models\nDenoising diffusion models\n[\n12\n,\n13\n]\naim to model the data distribution with\np\nθ\n​\n(\n𝒙\n0\n)\n:=\n∫\np\nθ\n​\n(\n𝒙\n0\n:\nN\n)\n​\n𝑑\n𝒙\n1\n:\nN\np_{\\theta}(\\boldsymbol{x}_{0}):=\\int p_{\\theta}(\\boldsymbol{x}_{0:N})\\,d\\boldsymbol{x}_{1:N}\nfrom samples\nx\n0\nx_{0}\nin the dataset.

General information on diffusion models is given in\nSection\n˜\nB.3\n.\n2\nMethod\nIn this section, we formulate our problem statement and describe our\nForl\ndiffusion model trained on the offline RL dataset to predict plausible states. Then, we introduce our online state estimation method,\nDimension-wise Closest Match that uses plausible states predicted by the multimodal\nForl\ndiffusion model (\nDm\n) and the states predicted from past episodes prior to evaluation by a probabilistic unimodal zero-shot time-series foundation model.\n2.1\nProblem Statement\nTraining (Offline Stationary MDP)\nWe begin with an episodic, stationary Markov Decision Process (MDP)\nℳ\ntrain\n=\n(\n𝒮\n,\n𝒜\n,\n𝒯\n,\nℛ\n,\nρ\n0\n)\n\\mathcal{M}_{\\text{train}}=(\\mathcal{S},\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{T},\\mathcal{R},\\rho_{0})\n, where the initial state distribution\nρ\n0\n\\rho_{0}\nis a uniform distribution over the state space\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\n. We only have access to an offline RL dataset\n𝒟\n=\n{\n(\n𝒔\nt\nk\n,\n𝒂\nt\nk\n,\n𝒔\nt\n+\n1\nk\n,\nr\nt\nk\n)\n}\n\\mathcal{D}=\\{(\\boldsymbol{s}^{k}_{t},\\boldsymbol{a}^{k}_{t},\\boldsymbol{s}^{k}_{t+1},r^{k}_{t})\\}\nwith\nk\nk\ntransitions collected from this MDP. Crucially, our\nForl\ndiffusion model and a diffusion policy\n[\n14\n]\nare trained offline using this dataset, such as the standard D4RL benchmark\n[\n15\n]\n, without making any assumptions about how the environment might become non‐stationary at test time.\nTest Environment (Sequence of POMDPs)\nAt test time, the agent faces an infinite sequence of POMDPs\n{\nℳ\n^\nj\n}\nj\n=\n1\n∞\n\\{\\hat{\\mathcal{M}}_{j}\\}_{j=1}^{\\infty}\n. Each POMDP is described by a 7-tuple\n[\n16\n]\nℳ\n^\nj\n=\n(\n𝒮\n,\n𝒜\n,\n𝒪\nj\n,\n𝒯\n,\nℛ\n,\nρ\n0\n,\n𝐱\nj\n)\n\\hat{\\mathcal{M}}_{j}=\\bigl(\\mathcal{S},\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{O}_{j},\\mathcal{T},\\mathcal{R},\\rho_{0},\\mathbf{x}_{j}\\bigr)\n, where the state space\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\n, action space\n𝒜\n\\mathcal{A}\n, transition function\n𝒯\n\\mathcal{T}\n, and the reward function\nℛ\n\\mathcal{R}\nremain identical to the training MDP.\n𝐱\n\\mathbf{x}\nis the observation function, where we restrict ourselves to deterministic versions (\n𝐱\n:\n𝒮\n→\n𝒪\n\\mathbf{x}:\\mathcal{S}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{O}\n)\n[\n17\n,\n6\n]\n.\nNon-stationary environments can be formulated in different ways.\nIn\nKhetarpal et al. [\n6\n]\n, a\ngeneral non-stationary RL\nformulation is put forward,\nwhich allows each component of the underlying MDP or POMDP to evolve over time, i.e.\n(\n𝒮\n​\n(\nt\n)\n,\n𝒜\n​\n(\nt\n)\n,\n𝒯\n​\n(\nt\n)\n,\nℛ\n​\n(\nt\n)\n,\n𝐱\n​\n(\nt\n)\n,\n𝒪\n​\n(\nt\n)\n)\n\\bigl(\\mathcal{S}(t),\\mathcal{A}(t),\\mathcal{T}(t),\\mathcal{R}(t),\\mathbf{x}(t),\\mathcal{O}(t)\\bigr)\n.\nA set\nκ\n\\kappa\nspecifies which of these components vary, and a\ndriver\ndetermines how they evolve. In particular,\npassive\ndrivers of non-stationarity imply that exogenous factors alone govern the evolution of the environment, independent of the agent’s actions.\nIn this work, we consider the scope of non-stationarity\n[\n6\n]\n(\nSection\n˜\nB.2\n) to be the observation function and the observation space, i.e.\nκ\n=\n{\n𝐱\n,\n𝒪\n}\n\\kappa=\\{\\mathbf{x},\\mathcal{O}\\}\n.\nWe consider the case where non-stationarity unfolds over episodes and where the observation function\n𝐱\nj\n\\mathbf{x}_{j}\nis different in each episode\nj\nj\n.\nThe change in the observation function is assumed to have an additive structure and is independent of the agent’s actions (passive non‐stationarity\n[\n6\n]\n).\nConcretely, the function\n𝐱\nj\n\\mathbf{x}_{j}\noffsets states\ns\nt\ns_{t}\nby a fixed offset\nb\nj\n∈\nℝ\nn\nb^{j}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}\n:\n𝒪\nj\n=\n{\ns\n+\nb\nj\n:\ns\n∈\n𝒮\n}\n,\n𝐱\nj\n​\n(\ns\n)\n=\ns\n+\nb\nj\n.\n\\mathcal{O}_{j}\\;=\\;\\{\\,s+b^{j}:\\,s\\in\\mathcal{S}\\},\\quad\\mathbf{x}_{j}(s)\\;=\\;s+b^{j}.\nImportantly, the sequence\n(\nb\nj\n)\n(b^{j})\ncan evolve under arbitrary real‐world time‐series data, and the agent\ndoes not have access to the ground-truth information throughout the evaluation\n—similar to scenarios where observations are only available periodically and shifts occur between these intervals. Thus, the episodes have a temporal order, relating to Non-Stationary Decision Processes (NSDP), defining a sequence of POMDPs\n[\n7\n]\n(\nSection\n˜\nB.2\n).\nPartial Observability and Historical Context\nSince\nb\nj\nb^{j}\nis\nnever directly observed\nfor\nP\nP\nepisodes into the future, each\nℳ\n^\nj\n\\hat{\\mathcal{M}}_{j}\nis a POMDP. The agent receives only the offset‐shifted observations\n(\no\nt\n)\n(o_{t})\n, where\no\nt\n=\ns\nt\n+\nb\nj\no_{t}=s_{t}+b^{j}\nwithout any noise. Moreover, the agent may have access to a limited historical context of previous offsets\n(\nb\nj\n−\nC\n,\n…\n,\nb\nj\n−\n1\n)\n(b^{j-C},\\dots,b^{j-1})\nat discrete intervals\nP\nP\n, but\nno direct information\nabout future offsets\n(\nb\nj\n,\nb\nj\n+\n1\n,\n…\n​\nb\nj\n+\nP\n−\n1\n)\n(b^{j},b^{j+1},\\dots b^{j+P-1})\n.\nHence, the agent must forecast and/or adapt to unknown future offsets without prior non‐stationary training.\nPartial Identifiability\nDespite observing\no\nt\n=\ns\nt\n+\nb\nj\no_{t}=s_{t}+b^{j}\n, the agent cannot generally disentangle\ns\nt\ns_{t}\nfrom\nb\nj\nb^{j}\n.\nFor any single observation, there are infinite possible pairs of state and offset that yield\no\nt\n=\ns\n′\n+\nb\n′\no_{t}=s^{\\prime}+b^{\\prime}\n. Additionally, the initial state distribution\nρ\n\\rho\nis uniform and does not provide information about\nb\nb\n.\nThus, we can only form a belief over\ns\nt\ns_{t}\nand refine that belief based on two sources of information:\na)\nthe sequence of actions and effects observed within an episode and\nb)\nthe sequence of past identified offsets.\nTo exploit source\na\n, we utilize a predictive model of commonly expected outcomes based on a diffusion model, which will be explained next. To make use of source\nb\n, we use a zero-shot forecasting model (see\nSection\n˜\n2.3\nfor details). Afterwards, both pieces of information are fused (\nSection\n˜\n2.4\n).\nFigure 3\n:\nCandidate states generated by\nForl\nDiffusion Model.\n2.2\nForl\nDiffusion Model\nIn our setting, we assume that the offsets added to the states are unobservable at test time, while the transition dynamics of the evaluation environment remain unchanged.\nTo eventually reduce the uncertainty about the underlying state,\nwe perform filtering or belief updates using the sequence of past interactions.\nTo understand why the history of interactions is indicative of a particular ground truth state, consider the following example in a maze environment illustrated in\nFig.\n˜\n3\n. When the agent moves north for three steps and then bumps into a wall, the possible ground truth states can only be those three steps south of any wall. The agent cannot observe the hidden green trajectory of ground-truth states; it only has access to the sequence of observation changes\n(\nΔ\n​\no\n)\n(\\Delta o)\nand action vectors, which narrows down the possible positions to four candidate regions—exactly those identified by our model.\nClearly, the distribution of possible states is highly multimodal,\nsuch that we propose using a diffusion model as a flexible predictive model of plausible states given the observed actions and outcomes.\nDiffusion models excel at capturing multimodal distributions\n[\n14\n]\n, making them well-suited for our task.\nWe train the diffusion model on offline data without offsets (\nb\nj\n=\n0\nb_{j}=0\n) which we detail below.\nTo distinguish between the trajectory timesteps in reinforcement learning (RL) and the timesteps in the diffusion process, we use the subscript\nt\n∈\n{\n0\n,\n…\n,\nT\n}\nt\\in\\{0,\\dots,T\\}\nto refer to RL timesteps and\nn\n∈\n{\n0\n,\n…\n,\nN\n}\nn\\in\\{0,\\dots,N\\}\nfor diffusion timesteps. We first begin by defining a subsequence of a trajectory\n𝝉\n(\nt\n,\nw\n)\n=\n[\n(\nΔ\n​\no\nt\n−\nw\n+\n1\n,\na\nt\n−\nw\n)\n,\n⋯\n,\n(\nΔ\n​\no\nt\n,\na\nt\n−\n1\n)\n]\n.\n\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{(t,w)}=\\left[\\left(\\Delta o_{t-w+1},a_{t-w}\\right),\\cdots,\\left(\\Delta o_{t},a_{t-1}\\right)\\right].\n(1)\nwhere delta observations\nΔ\n​\no\nt\n=\no\nt\n−\no\nt\n−\n1\n=\ns\nt\n−\ns\nt\n−\n1\n\\Delta o_{t}=o_{t}-o_{t-1}=s_{t}-s_{t-1}\ndenote the state changes (effects),\nw\nw\nis the window size.

Using the probabilistic\nZero-Shot FM\nwe generate (\nb\n^\nl\nj\n,\n…\n,\nb\n^\nl\nj\n+\nP\n−\n1\n{\\hat{b}^{j}_{l},\\dots,\\hat{b}_{l}^{j+P-1}}\n), where (\nl\nl\n) denotes the number of samples generated for each episode (timestamp). Since Lag-Llama is a probabilistic model, it can generate multiple samples per timestamp, conditioned on\nC\nC\nnumber of past contexts (\nb\nj\n−\nC\n,\n…\n,\nb\nj\n−\n1\n{b^{j-C},\\dots,b^{j-1}}\n). In practice, we forecast every dimension of\nb\nb\nindependently since the\nZero-Shot FM\n(Lag-Llama\n[\n10\n]\n) is a univariate probabilistic model.\n2.4\nForl\nState Estimation\nThe next step in our method is to fuse the information from the forecaster and the diffusion model into a state estimate used for control at test time.\nAt the beginning of an episode, no information can be obtained from the diffusion model, so for the first\nw\nw\nsteps we only rely on the forecaster’s mean prediction, i.e.\ns\n~\nt\n=\no\nt\n−\nb\n^\nj\n¯\n{\\tilde{s}_{t}}=o_{t}-\\overline{\\hat{b}^{j}}\nwhere the mean is taken over the\nl\nl\nsamples.\nFigure 4\n:\nDistribution of samples produced by DCM (histograms for 10k samples for illustration).\nAs soon as\nw\nw\nsteps are taken, our\nForl\nState Estimation\nimproves on the inferred state as detailed below.\nFigure\n2\noffers an overview of the entire system and Algorithm\n1\nprovides a detailed pseudocode.\nTo recap, the diffusion model generates samples\n{\n𝒔\nt\n(\n0\n)\n}\nk\n\\{\\boldsymbol{s}_{t}^{(0)}\\}_{k}\nfrom the in-episode history\nτ\n\\tau\n,\nEq.\n˜\n1\n. These samples represent a multimodal distribution of plausible state regions.\nThe\nZero-Shot FM\ngenerates\nl\nl\nsamples of offsets\n{\nb\n^\n}\nl\n\\{\\hat{b}\\}_{l}\nfrom which we compute forecasted states using\n{\n𝒔\n^\nt\n}\nl\n=\no\nt\n−\n{\nb\n^\n}\nl\n\\{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{s}}_{t}\\}_{l}=o_{t}-\\{\\hat{b}\\}_{l}\n.\nForl\n: Dimension-wise Closest Match (DCM)\nWe propose a lightweight approach to sample a good estimate based on the samples from the multimodal (\ndiffusion model\n{\n𝐬\nt\n(\n0\n)\n}\nk\n\\{\\boldsymbol{s}_{t}^{(0)}\\}_{k}\n) and unimodal (\nZero-Shot FM\n{\ns\n^\nt\nb\n}\nl\n\\{\\hat{s}^{b}_{t}\\}_{l}\n) distributions.\nLet\n𝒟\ndiffusion\n=\n{\n𝐱\n1\n,\n…\n,\n𝐱\nk\n}\n,\n𝒟\ntimeseries\n=\n{\n𝐲\n1\n,\n…\n,\n𝐲\nl\n}\n,\n\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{diffusion}}=\\{\\mathbf{x}_{1},\\dots,\\mathbf{x}_{k}\\},\\quad\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{timeseries}}=\\{\\mathbf{y}_{1},\\dots,\\mathbf{y}_{l}\\},\nwhere\n𝐱\ni\n,\n𝐲\nj\n∈\nℝ\nn\n\\mathbf{x}_{i},\\mathbf{y}_{j}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}\n. Then DCM constructs\n𝐳\n∈\nℝ\nn\n\\mathbf{z}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}\nby\nz\nd\n=\ny\nj\n∗\n​\n(\nd\n)\n,\nd\nwhere\nj\n∗\n​\n(\nd\n)\n=\narg\n⁡\nmin\nj\n⁡\n(\nmin\ni\n⁡\n|\nx\ni\n,\nd\n−\ny\nj\n,\nd\n|\n)\n,\nz_{d}\\;=\\;y_{j^{*}(d),d}\\quad\\text{where}\\quad j^{*}(d)\\;=\\;\\arg\\min_{j}\\Bigl(\\;\\min_{i}\\bigl|\\;x_{i,d}-y_{j,d}\\bigr|\\Bigr),\nwhere\nd\n=\n1\n​\n…\n​\nn\nd=1\\dots n\n.\nIn other words, for each dimension\nd\nd\n, we choose the sample from\n𝒟\ntimeseries\n\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{timeseries}}\nthat has the closest sample in\n𝒟\ndiffusion\n\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{diffusion}}\n. The process is straightforward yet effective, and under ideal sampling conditions for a toy dataset in\nFig.\n˜\n4\n, DCM approximately samples from the product distribution. DCM uses a non-parametric search to find the forecast sample with the highest score, which corresponds to the minimum dimension-wise distance. DCM’s prediction error is governed by the accuracy of the forecast samples in the unimodal\n𝒟\ntimeseries\n\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{timeseries}}\nthat achieves this best score. As we will demonstrate in the experiments, this approach empirically yields lower maximum errors and is more stable compared to other methods.\nForl\nAlgorithm\nAlgorithm\n1\nsummarizes the entire inference process at test time. We begin the episode by relying on the forecasted states\ns\n~\n0\n\\tilde{s}_{0}\n. As more transitions\n(\nΔ\n​\no\nt\n,\na\nt\n−\n1\n)\n(\\Delta o_{t},a_{t-1})\nbecome available, the\nForl\ndiffusion model proposes candidate states\n{\n𝒔\nt\n(\n0\n)\n}\nk\n\\{\\boldsymbol{s}_{t}^{(0)}\\}_{k}\nthrough\nretrospection\n—reasoning over the past in-episode experience to adapt state estimation on the fly when they begin to diverge from predictions. We then invoke DCM to blend the diffusion model’s candidates with the foundation model’s unimodal forecasts and obtain the final state estimate\ns\n~\nt\n\\tilde{s}_{t}\n. We use an off-the-shelf offline RL policy such as Diffusion-QL (\nDQL\n)\n[\n14\n]\nto select the agent’s action\na\nt\na_{t}\n.\nFigure 5\n:\nZero-shot forecasting results of Lag-Llama\n[\n10\n]\nfor the first univariate series (plotted) from the\nreal-data-A,D\ndatasets; experiments use the\nfirst two series from each dataset\n.\nSummary\nBy combining a powerful\nzero-shot\nforecasting model with a\nconditional diffusion\nmechanism,\nForl\naddresses partial observability in continuous state and action space when ground-truth offsets are unavailable. This procedure is performed in the\nabsence of ground-truth offsets for past, current, and future episodes over the interval\nj\n:\nj\n+\nP\nj:j+P\nat test time\n. DCM provides a computationally inexpensive yet effective way of using the multimodal diffusion candidates and unimodal time-series forecasts. This robust adaptation approach yields a state estimate\ns\n~\nt\n\\tilde{s}_{t}\n, aligned with the agent’s retrospective experience in the stationary offline RL dataset, incorporating a prospective external offset forecast.\nTable 1\n:\nNormalized scores (mean ± std.) for\nForl\nframework and the baselines.\nBold are the best values, and those not significantly different (\np\n>\n0.05\np>0.05\n,

By using the model learned from the offline data,\nDmbp\n+\nLag\naims to refine the forecasted states to make robust state estimations. The underlying policies throughout our experiments are identical policy checkpoints for both our method and the baselines.\nFigure 6\n:\nVisualization of states, predicted states as the agent navigates the environment.\nIllustrative Example\nFigs.\n˜\n6\nand\n16\nillustrate an agent navigating the\nmaze2d-large\nenvironment where the true position is labeled as “state”. The agent receives an observation indicating where it\nbelieves\nit is located due to unknown time-dependent factors. The candidate states predicted by the\nForl\ndiffusion model are shown as circles. Importantly, the agent’s\n(\nΔ\n​\no\n,\na\n)\n(\\Delta o,a)\n-trajectory can reveal possible states for the agent.\nForl\n’s diffusion model (\nDm\n) component predicts these candidate states by using observation changes\n(\nΔ\n​\no\n)\n(\\Delta o)\nand corresponding actions\n(\na\n)\n(a)\n. The possible candidate regions where the agent can be are limited, and our model successfully captures these locations.\nForl\n’s candidate selection module (DCM) uses the samples from the forecaster and the diffusion model to recover a close estimate for the state. In contrast, the baseline\nDQL\n+\nLag\n-\ns\n¯\n\\bar{s}\nrelies on the forecaster\n[\n10\n]\nfor state predictions, which are significantly farther from the actual state. Consistent with the results in\nFig.\n˜\n7\n,\nForl\nreduces prediction errors at test-time, thereby improving performance.\nFigure 7\n:\nPrediction Error in recovering true agent state.\n3.1\nResults\nFORL outperforms both pure forecasting (\nDQL\n+\nLag\n-\ns\n¯\n\\bar{s}\n) and the two-stage strategy that first predicts offsets with a time-series model and then applies a noise-robust offline RL algorithm (\nDmbp\n+\nLag\n). Its advantage is consistent across previously unseen non-stationary perturbations from five domains, each introducing a distinct univariate series into a separate state dimension at test time.\nWe present the average normalized scores over the prediction length\nP\nP\nacross multiple episodes run in the D4RL\n[\n15\n]\nand OGBench\n[\n21\n]\nfor each time-series in Table\n1\n. We conduct pairwise Welch’s t-tests across all settings.\nFigure\n7\nplots the\nℓ\n2\n\\ell_{2}\nnorm between the ground-truth states\ns\nt\ns_{t}\nand those predicted by\nForl\nand the baselines in the\nantmaze\nand\nmaze2d\nenvironments. Consistent with the average scores,\nForl\nachieves the lowest prediction error on average.\nFigure 8\n:\nDM Ablations\n3.1.1\nNo Access to Past Offsets\nWe evaluate different variants of using\nDm\nand\nZero-Shot FM\nwhen we do not have any access to past offsets in\nFig.\n˜\n8\n.\nForl\n-\nDm\n(\nDm\n):\nDiffusion Model utilizes the candidate states generated by the\nForl\n’s diffusion model component (Section\n2.2\n), which can be a multimodal distribution (\nFig.\n˜\n3\n). Compared to\nDm\n, the full\nForl\nframework yields a 97.8% relative performance improvement. Notably,\nDm\nperforms on par with our extended baselines that incorporate historical offsets and forecasting—\nDmbp\n+\nLag\n,\nDQL\n+\nLag\n-\ns\n¯\n\\bar{s}\n, and\nDQL\n+\nLag\n-\ns\n~\n\\tilde{s}\n. Moreover, without access to historical offset information before evaluation,\nDm\nachieves a 151.4% improvement over\nDQL\n, demonstrating its efficacy as a standalone module trained solely on a standard, stationary offline RL dataset without offset labels.\nH-Lag\n:\nWe maintain a history of offsets generated by\nDm\nover the most recent\nC\nC\nepisodes (excluding the evaluation interval\nP\nP\n, since offsets are not revealed after episode termination at test-time). We then feed this history into the\nZero-Shot FM\nto generate offset samples for the next\nP\nP\nevaluation episodes. These samples are applied directly at test time.\nH-Lag\n+\ndcm\n:\nWe initially follow the same procedure in\nH-Lag\nto obtain predictions from\nZero-Shot FM\n. Then, we apply\nDCM\nto these predicted offsets and the candidate states generated by\nForl\n’s diffusion model. We also compare against\nMed\n+\ndcm\nand\nMed\n+\nNoise\n, simpler median-based heuristics detailed in\nAppendix\n˜\nG\n. Empirically,\nH-Lag\n+\ndcm\noutperforms\nH-Lag\n, demonstrating that DCM with\nForl\n’s diffusion model can improve robustness. Overall, scores and prediction errors indicate that just using the samples from\nDm\nhas better scores on average, while\nH-Lag\n+\ndcm\nis more stable in\nFig.\n˜\n15\n.\n3.1.2\nDimension-wise Closest Match (DCM) Ablations\nFigure 9\n:\nCandidate Selection\nWe compare\nForl\n(DCM) against four alternative fusion strategies.\nForl(KDE)\n: For each dimension, we fit a kernel density estimator (KDE) on\n𝒟\ndiffusion\n=\n{\n𝒔\nt\n(\n0\n)\n}\nk\n\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{diffusion}}=\\{\\boldsymbol{s}_{t}^{(0)}\\}_{k}\nand then we evaluate that probability density function for each point in\n𝒟\ntimeseries\n\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{timeseries}}\n. Then, we take the product of these densities in each dimension to obtain the weight for each sample\ns\n^\nt\nb\n\\hat{s}^{b}_{t}\n.\nWe obtain a single representative sample by taking the weighted average of samples in\n𝒟\ntimeseries\n\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{timeseries}}\n.\nTo ensure stability, when the sum of the weights is near zero, we use the mean of the\n𝒟\ntimeseries\n\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{timeseries}}\nas the states. We use Scott’s rule\n[\n24\n]\nto compute the bandwidth.\nDM-FS\n-\ns\n¯\n\\bar{s}\n,\nDM-FS\n-\ns\n~\n\\tilde{s}\nselect the closest prediction from DM to the mean and median of the\nZero-Shot FM\n’s predictions, respectively.\nForl\n(\nmax\n) constructs a diagonal multivariate distribution from the dimension-wise mean and standard deviation of the forecasted states, then selects the sample predicted by our diffusion model with the highest likelihood under that distribution. Although all baselines fuse information using the same two sets generated by the diffusion model and\nZero-Shot FM\n, DCM has higher performance. In\nTable\n˜\n8\nwe compute the maximum, minimum, and mean prediction error values over the test episodes used in\nFig.\n˜\n6\n.\nForl\n(DCM) yields significantly stable prediction errors (\nMaximum Error\n↓\n\\texttt{Maximum Error}\\downarrow\n:\n2.40\n) for both maximum error and mean error compared to\nForl\n(\nmax\n) (\nMaximum Error\n↓\n\\texttt{Maximum Error}\\downarrow\n:\n9.33\n) demonstrating its robustness.\n3.1.3\nIntra-episode Non-stationarity\nFigure 10\n:\nIntra-Episode Performance\nOur framework can natively handle intra-episode offsets, where the offset changes every\nf\n=\n50\nf=50\ntimesteps. In this setting, the offsets become available after the episode terminates, but the agent is subject to a time-dependent unknown offset within the episode. Zero-shot forecasting foundation module can generate samples before the episode begins. Our diffusion model (\nForl\n-\nDm\n) itself does not rely on the forecasts of the foundation module and only tracks observation changes and actions which are invariant to the offsets. The DCM can adaptively fuse information from both models at each timestep without requiring any hyperparameters.\nTables\n˜\n10\nand\n10\nshow the average scores for\nDQL\nvs.\nForl\n-\nDm\nand\nDQL\n+\nLag\n-\ns\n¯\n\\bar{s}\nvs.\nForl\n. Among the algorithms that do not use any past ground truth offsets\nDQL\nand\nForl\n-\nDm\n, only using the diffusion model of\nForl\nsignificantly increases performance. When we have access to past offsets,\nForl\nobtains a superior performance. This shows that our method covers both cases, when information is available and not available, even when offsets are not constant throughout the episode.\n3.1.4\nOffset-Scaling\nFigure 11\n:\nImpact of offset scaling\n(\nα\n)\n(\\alpha)\non average normalized scores.\nWe scale the offsets with\nα\n\\alpha\nacross all maze experiments. We conduct experiments in 5 environments (all antmaze and maze2d used in Table\n1\n) across 5 time-series dataset setups with\nα\n∈\n\\alpha\\in\n{0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0}, where\nα\n=\n0\n\\alpha=0\nis the standard offline RL environment used during training and\nα\n=\n1.0\n\\alpha=1.0\nis our evaluation setup.

We observe similar performance gains when applying\nForl\nto other policies (\nAppendices\n˜\nE\nand\nE\n), including Implicit Q-Learning (\nIql\n)\n[\n26\n]\nand\nFQL\n[\n23\n]\n, as detailed in\nTable\n˜\n4\nand\nTable\n˜\n7\n.\n4\nRelated Work\nReinforcement Learning in Non-Stationary Environments\nExisting works in non-stationary reinforcement learning (RL) predominantly focus on adapting to changing transition dynamics and reward functions.\nAckermann et al. [\n27\n]\npropose an offline RL framework that incorporates structured non-stationarity in reward and transition functions by learning hidden task representations and predicting them at test time. Although our work also investigates the intersection of non-stationary environments and offline RL, we assume stationarity during training. To learn adaptive policies\nonline\n, meta-learning algorithms have been proposed as a promising approach\n[\n28\n,\n29\n,\n30\n]\n.\nAl-Shedivat et al. [\n29\n]\nexplores a competitive multi-agent environment where transition dynamics change. While these approaches provide valuable insights, they often require samples from the current environment and struggle in non-trivial non-stationarity, highlighting the need for more future-oriented methods\n[\n31\n,\n9\n]\n. Examples of such future-oriented approaches include Proactively Synchronizing Tempo (ProST)\n[\n9\n]\nand Prognosticator\n[\n31\n]\n, which address the evolution of transition and reward functions over time. ProST leverages a forecaster, namely, Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and a model predictor to optimize for future policies in environments to overcome the time-synchronization issue in time-elapsing MDPs. This approach aligns with our focus on time-varying environments and similarly utilizes real-world finance (e.g., stock price) time-series datasets to model non-stationarity. Both ProST and Prognosticator assume that states are fully observable during testing and that online interaction with the environment is possible during training—conditions that are not always feasible in the real world. Instead, our approach assumes that states are not fully observable and that direct interaction with the environment during training is not feasible, necessitating that the policy be learned exclusively from a pre-collected dataset.\nRobust offline RL\nTesting-time robust offline RL methods\nDmbp\n[\n3\n]\n,\nRorl\n[\n25\n]\nexamine scenarios where a noise-free, stationary dataset is used for training, but corruption is introduced during testing. This is distinct from\n[\n3\n]\n, training-time robust offline RL\n[\n32\n,\n33\n]\n, which assumes a corrupted training dataset. Both\nRorl\n[\n25\n]\nand\nDmbp\n[\n3\n]\nassume access only to a clean, uncorrupted offline RL dataset, as\nForl\n, and they are evaluated in a perturbed environment. To the best of our knowledge,\nForl\nis the first work to extend this setting to a non-Markovian, time-evolving, non-stationary deployment environment. We focus on time-dependent exogenous factors from real-data that are aligned with the definition of a non-stationary environment\n[\n6\n]\n.\nDiffusion models in offline RL\nDiffusion models\n[\n12\n]\nhave seen widespread adoption in RL\n[\n34\n,\n35\n]\ndue to their remarkable expressiveness, particularly in representing multimodal distributions, scalability, and stable training properties. In the context of offline RL, diffusion models have been used for representing policies\n[\n14\n,\n36\n,\n37\n,\n38\n]\n, planners\n[\n39\n,\n40\n]\n, data synthesis\n[\n41\n,\n42\n]\n, and removing noise\n[\n3\n]\n. Notably, Diffusion Q-learning\n[\n14\n]\nleverages conditional diffusion model policies to learn from offline RL datasets, maintaining proximity to behavior policy while utilizing Q-value function guidance. In contrast, our method harnesses diffusion models to learn from a sequence of actions and effect tuples, leveraging the multimodal capabilities of diffusion models to identify diverse candidate locations of the hidden states.\n5\nConclusion\nWe introduce\nF\norecasting in Non-stationary\nO\nffline\nRL\n(\nForl\n), a novel framework designed to be robust to passive non-stationarities that arise at test time. This is crucial when an agent trained on an offline RL dataset is deployed in a non-stationary environment or when the environment begins to exhibit partial observability due to unknown, time-varying factors.\nForl\nleverages diffusion probabilistic models and zero-shot time series foundation models to correct unknown offsets in observations, thereby enhancing the adaptability of learned policies. Our empirical results across diverse time-series datasets, OGBench\n[\n21\n]\nand D4RL\n[\n15\n]\nbenchmarks, demonstrate that\nForl\nnot only bridges the gap between forecasting and non-stationary offline RL but also consistently outperforms the baselines. Our approach is currently limited by the assumption of additive perturbations. For future work, we plan to extend our work to more general observation transformations.\nAcknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\nGeorg Martius is a member of the Machine Learning Cluster of Excellence, EXC number 2064/1 – Project number 390727645.

Policy constraint methods actively avoid querying OOD actions during training by leveraging probabilistic metrics which can be explicit\n[\n46\n,\n47\n]\n, implicit\n[\n48\n,\n49\n]\nf\nf\n-divergence\n[\n50\n]\n, or integral probability metrics\n[\n51\n]\n. These metrics ensure that the learned policy\nπ\nθ\n\\pi_{\\theta}\nremains close to the behavior policy\nπ\nβ\n\\pi_{\\beta}\nthat generated the offline RL dataset\n[\n1\n]\n. Similarly, pessimistic value function approaches regularize the value function or the Q-function to avoid overestimations in OOD regions. Model-based offline RL methods\n[\n52\n]\n, on the other hand, focus on learning the environment’s dynamics, benefiting from the strengths of supervised learning approaches. However, in the same vein, these methods are susceptible to the distribution shift problem in Offline RL\n[\n1\n]\n. We detail the offline RL algorithms used in our experiments in\nAppendix\n˜\nE\n.\nPark et al. [\n53\n]\nemphasize the challenges of generalizing policies to test-time states which are not in the support of the offline RL dataset. While prior works have investigated the issue of generalization\n[\n38\n,\n54\n]\n, in testing-time robust RL methods\n[\n3\n]\nthis challenge is exacerbated through the introduction of noise into the states by an unknown adversary.\nAppendix B\nBackground\nB.1\nReinforcement Learning\nMarkov Decision Processes (MDPs) are often used to formalize Reinforcement Learning (RL). MDP is defined by the tuple\nℳ\n≐\n(\n𝒮\n,\n𝒜\n,\n𝒯\n,\nℛ\n,\nρ\n0\n,\nγ\n)\n\\mathcal{M}\\doteq\\bigl(\\mathcal{S},\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{T},\\mathcal{R},\\rho_{0},\\gamma\\bigr)\nwhere\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\nis the state space,\n𝒜\n\\mathcal{A}\nis the action space,\n𝒯\n\\mathcal{T}\nis the transition function (which may be deterministic or stochastic),\nℛ\n:\n𝒮\n×\n𝒜\n→\nℝ\n\\mathcal{R}:\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}\nis the reward function,\nρ\n0\n\\rho_{0}\nis the initial state distribution and\nγ\n∈\n[\n0\n,\n1\n)\n\\gamma\\in[0,1)\nis the discount factor\n[\n55\n]\n. In online and off-policy RL algorithms an agent can interact with the environment using a parameterized policy\nπ\nθ\n​\n(\n𝒂\n|\n𝒔\n)\n\\pi_{\\theta}(\\boldsymbol{a}|\\boldsymbol{s})\n, to maximize the expected return\n𝔼\nπ\n​\n[\n∑\nt\nγ\nt\n​\nr\n​\n(\n𝒔\nt\n,\n𝒂\nt\n)\n]\n\\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}\\left[\\sum_{t}\\gamma^{t}r\\left(\\boldsymbol{s}_{t},\\boldsymbol{a}_{t}\\right)\\right]\n. In contrast, offline RL requires the agent to learn from a static dataset\n𝒟\n=\n{\n(\n𝒔\nk\n,\n𝒂\nk\n,\n𝒔\nk\n′\n,\nr\nk\n)\n}\nk\n=\n1\nN\n\\mathcal{D}=\\{(\\boldsymbol{s}_{k},\\boldsymbol{a}_{k},\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\prime}_{k},r_{k})\\}^{N}_{k=1}\ngenerated by a generally unknown behavior policy\nπ\nβ\n​\n(\n𝒂\n|\n𝒔\n)\n\\pi_{\\beta}(\\boldsymbol{a}|\\boldsymbol{s})\n[\n1\n]\n.\nB.2\nNon-Stationary Environments\nWe next review tangential definitions and formalisms used for non-stationary environments.\nDefinition B.1\n(Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes\n[\n16\n,\n7\n,\n6\n]\n)\n.\nA Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) is given by the tuple\nℳ\n^\n=\n(\n𝒮\n,\n𝒜\n,\n𝒪\n,\n𝒯\n,\nℛ\n,\n𝐱\n,\nρ\n0\n,\nγ\n)\n,\n\\hat{\\mathcal{M}}\\,=\\,\\bigl(\\mathcal{S},\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{O},\\mathcal{T},\\mathcal{R},\\mathbf{x},\\rho_{0},\\gamma\\bigr),\nwhere\n𝒪\n\\mathcal{O}\nis the observation space and\n𝐱\n\\mathbf{x}\nis the observation function.

[\n6\n]\npresent a\ngeneral non-stationary RL\nformulation, which allows each component of the underlying MDP or POMDP to evolve over time. Concretely, this time-varying tuple is denoted as\n(\n𝒮\n​\n(\nt\n)\n,\n𝒜\n​\n(\nt\n)\n,\n𝒯\n​\n(\nt\n)\n,\nℛ\n​\n(\nt\n)\n,\n𝐱\n​\n(\nt\n)\n,\n𝒪\n​\n(\nt\n)\n)\n\\bigl(\\mathcal{S}(t),\\mathcal{A}(t),\\mathcal{T}(t),\\mathcal{R}(t),\\mathbf{x}(t),\\mathcal{O}(t)\\bigr)\nwhere each element is represented by a function\nφ\n​\n(\ni\n,\nt\n)\n\\varphi(i,t)\n, indicating its variation with time\nt\nt\nand input\ni\ni\n[\n6\n]\n.\nScope\n, denoted by a set\nκ\n\\kappa\n, specifies which of these components vary.\nDefinition B.2\n(Scope of Non-Stationarity\n[\n6\n]\n)\n.\nGiven the general non-stationary RL framework, the\nscope of non-stationarity\nis the subset\nκ\n⊆\n{\n𝒮\n,\n𝒜\n,\nℛ\n,\n𝒯\n,\n𝐱\n,\n𝒪\n}\n,\n\\kappa\\,\\subseteq\\,\\{\\mathcal{S},\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{R},\\mathcal{T},\\mathbf{x},\\mathcal{O}\\},\nindicating which components of the environment evolve over time.\nNotably,\nChandak [\n7\n]\ndefines Non-Stationary Decision Process (NSDP) as a sequence of POMDPs, with non-stationarity confined to the subset\nκ\n⊆\n{\nℛ\n,\n𝒯\n,\n𝐱\n}\n\\kappa\\subseteq\\{\\mathcal{R},\\mathcal{T},\\mathbf{x}\\}\n, where the initial state distribution\nρ\n0\n,\nj\n\\rho_{0,j}\nvaries between POMDPs. Existing research in non‑stationary RL largely focuses on the episodic evolution of transition dynamics and reward functions\n[\n27\n]\n. In contrast, the evolution of observation functions remains underexplored, despite its potential for real-world applicability and thus demands further investigation\n[\n6\n]\n.

Diffusion Q-Learning (\nDQL\n)\n[\n14\n]\nserves as our base policy across all baselines and for our method in D4RL experiments\n[\n15\n]\n. Details on\nDQL\nare provided in Section\nE\nD.1\nDQL\nExtensions with\nZero-Shot FM\nFor our baselines, we use a diffusion-based offline RL policy,\nDQL\n[\n14\n]\n, with three variations:\n•\nDQL\n:\nDQL\npolicy directly generates actions conditioned on the observations. We include it to demonstrate how large episodic offsets degrade policy performance, and its consistently poor performance underscores the difficulty introduced by our offset settings.\n•\nDQL\n+\nLag\n-\ns\n¯\n\\bar{s}\n:\nWe use\nZero-Shot FM\n(Lag-Llama\n[\n10\n]\n) to forecast episodic offsets over a horizon of\nP\nP\nepisodes using pre-deployment offset history, and then subtract the mean predicted offset corresponding to that episode from the observations. Thus,\nDQL\ngenerates actions conditioned on the sample mean of the forecasted states\n{\ns\n^\nt\nb\n}\nl\n\\{\\hat{s}^{b}_{t}\\}_{l}\n. Although\nDQL\n+\nLag\n-\ns\n¯\n\\bar{s}\noutperforms\nDQL\n, a straightforward application of forecasting and decision-making reveals performance degradation when offsets lack adaptive correction.\n•\nDQL\n+\nLag\n-\ns\n~\n\\tilde{s}\n:\nWe use the sample median instead of the sample mean in\nDQL\n+\nLag\n-\ns\n¯\n\\bar{s}\n, to mitigate outlier effects.

Similar to our framework, perturbed states are passed to\nDmbp\n, which removes the perturbations; the generated state is then fed to the policy. For a fair comparison, we adopt the policies also used in their work for our experiments,\nRorl\n[\n25\n]\nand\nTd\n3\nBc\n[\n2\n]\nalongside\nDQL\n.\nDmbp\n+\nLag\nextends\nDmbp\nwith the forecasting module in our experiments.

A naive integration of\nDmbp\nrelies on initial ground‐truth states and underperforms.\nFor the evaluation of\nDmbp\nwe use the open source code and the suggested hyperparameters available in\n[\n56\n]\n. To improve the performance of\nDmbp\n, we conducted evaluations at test-time and reported the best-performing results for a range of different diffusion timesteps.\nDmbp\nrequires the diffusion timesteps to be manually defined based on different noise scales and types. Hence, we use the diffusion timesteps across a range of noise scales\n{\n0.15\n,\n0.25\n,\n0.5\n}\n\\{0.15,0.25,0.5\\}\nfor maze and\n{\n0.05\n,\n0.1\n,\n0.15\n,\n0.25\n}\n\\{0.05,0.1,0.15,0.25\\}\nfor kitchen environments and identify that the best performance requires different noise scales across environment datasets.

To achieve this, it introduces a conservative smoothing mechanism that balances mitigating abrupt changes in the value function for proximate states and avoiding value overestimation in risky regions that are absent from the dataset. Concretely, RORL regularizes both the policy and the value function, leveraging bootstrapping Q-functions and conservative smoothing of the perturbed states. This formulation yields robust training under adversarial perturbations in the observation function while preserving strong performance even in unperturbed environments. However, although using RORL as our base policy improved performance in\nmaze2d\nenvironments,\nForl\nsignificantly outperforms both its naive usage, the extension with our forecasting module\nRorl\n+\nLag\n-\ns\n¯\n\\bar{s}\n, and\nDmbp\n+\nLag\n-R in\nTable\n˜\n2\nand\nTable\n˜\n3\n.

LAG denotes the integration of a zero-shot time-series foundation model\n[\n10\n]\n. While\nForl\nand\nmax\nalso utilize this model, the subscripts are omitted for brevity.\nFigure 15\n:\nPerformance comparison without access to past offsets.\nAverage normalized scores and prediction errors for\nForl\n(ours)\nversus baselines, aggregated over 25 experiments (5 random seeds each) in D4RL\n[\n15\n]\n. LAG denotes the integration of a zero-shot time-series foundation model\n[\n10\n]\n. However, in this setting\nZero-Shot FM\nuses the samples from\nDm\ninstead of past offsets.\nTo analyze the challenging identifiability issue arising from (i) non‑smoothly varying offsets and (ii) the unobservability of ground truth offsets throughout the evaluation interval, we implement a set of methods for the setting where we never have delayed access to past ground truth offsets.\nFig.\n˜\n14\nshows the average normalized scores and prediction accuracies over 25 environment–non-stationarity pairs across five random seeds in navigation control tasks with continuous state and action spaces. Overall, these methods underperform compared to\nForl\n. Among the cases with no access to past offsets (see\nFig.\n˜\n15\n), the best-performing methods are our proposed candidate state generation module (\nForl\n-\nDm\n) and\nH-Lag\n+\ndcm\n, a version of\nForl\nthat utilizes\nZero-Shot FM\nin addition to\nDm\nwhich we detailed in\nSection\n˜\n3.1.1\n.\nForl\n-\nDm\n(\nDm\n)\nForl\n-\nDm\n, which we also refer to as\nDm\nfor brevity, directly uses the state predicted by the diffusion model component. Given the multimodal nature of these candidate states, this selection does not fully leverage our framework. Yet,\nDm\noutperforms the baselines when no past offsets are used. Additional comparisons in\nTable\n˜\n6\nwith other standard statistical methods like\nDm-Mad\n,\nDm-Ransac\n,\nDm-Running\n-\nμ\n\\mu\n,\nDm-Running\n-\nμ\n\\mu\n-p\nindicate that only using the sample predicted by the diffusion model yields higher scores on average.\nMed\n+\ndcm\nWe compute the median of the predicted offsets from the previous episode, beginning with the first episode predicted by\nForl\n’s diffusion model. We then fit a Gaussian distribution centered at this median and sample\nl\nl\noffsets from it, matching the sample count of\nZero-Shot FM\n. Next, we apply\nDCM\nto these samples with the candidates generated by the diffusion model.\nFigure 16\n:\nIllustrations of states, observations, diffusion model predictions\n{\ns\nt\n(\n0\n)\n}\nk\n\\{\\boldsymbol{s}_{t}^{(0)}\\}_{k}\n, and predicted states from\nForl\n(DCM),\nForl\n-\nDm\n,\nDQL\n+\nLag\n-\ns\n¯\n\\bar{s}\n,\nDQL\n+\nLag\n-\ns\n~\n\\tilde{s}\n,\nForl\n(\nmax\n),\nDmbp\n+\nLag\nare shown.\nThese visualizations are from the same setting presented in\nFig.\n˜\n12\n. Maximum, minimum, and mean prediction errors across episodes for this task are provided in\nTable\n˜\n8\n.\nMed\n+\nNoise\nWe begin by computing the median offset produced by the diffusion model during the first evaluation episode similar to\nMed\n+\ndcm\n. Thereafter, we treat these offsets as evolving according to a random walk, where each offset is predicted as the previous value with white noise increments.\nDm-Mad\nDm-Mad\nfollows a state estimation based on robust statistics\n[\n69\n]\n.\nDm-Mad\ncomputes the coordinate-wise median of the differences between the observation and each denoiser prediction and discards any sample whose absolute deviation from this median exceeds\nϵ\n\\epsilon\nx Median Absolute Deviation (MAD). Then, it takes the median of the remaining inliers to obtain a robust offset estimate and subtracts that offset from the observation to obtain the state\ns\nt\n~\n\\tilde{s_{t}}\n.\nDm-Ransac\nDm-Ransac\nis a RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC)\n[\n70\n]\nbased state estimation using the samples from our\nDm\n.\nDm-Ransac\ncalculates the offsets using the states generated by our\nDm\nand the observation, setting an adaptive per-dimension threshold as\nϵ\n\\epsilon\nx MAD. Then, it repeatedly samples a random offset candidate and chooses the candidate whose inlier set (differences within that threshold) is the largest. Then, it takes the average of those inliers to estimate the offset.\nDm-Running\n-\nμ\n\\mu\nDm-Running\n-\nμ\n\\mu\ncomputes a numerically stable, global running mean\n[\n71\n,\n72\n]\nof offsets from\nDm\naggregated across all timesteps and episodes.\nDm-Running\n-\nμ\n\\mu\n-p\nDm-Running\n-\nμ\n\\mu\n-p\ncomputes an online average of offsets\n[\n71\n,\n72\n]\nfrom\nDm\n(Running-\nμ\n\\mu\n) per episode\np\np\n.

H\nCandidate Selection\nThe results in\nTable\n˜\n9\n,\nTable\n˜\n8\n, and\nTable\n˜\n7\nshow that\nForl\n(DCM) more consistently performs better than other methods. Although the KDE-based\nForl(KDE)\nmethod performs well in\nantmaze-medium-diverse\n, it significantly underperforms in\ncube-single-play\n(\nTable\n˜\n7\n). Moreover, it requires bandwidth selection and a fallback mechanism to handle numerical instability, which highlights the practical advantage of DCM.\nForl\n(\nmax\n), also referred to as\nmax\nfor brevity, can fail when the forecast mean of\nD\nt\n​\ni\n​\nm\n​\ne\n​\ns\n​\ne\n​\nr\n​\ni\n​\ne\n​\ns\nD_{timeseries}\nis biased, misleading it to select a candidate from a geometrically distant mode that appears more likely under an inaccurate forecast. In contrast, DCM succeeds because its state estimation is not dependent on the forecast’s mean, but on a non-parametric search for the forecast sample with the highest score (minimum dimension-wise distance). Hence, DCM’s prediction error is governed by the accuracy of the forecast sample in\nD\nt\n​\ni\n​\nm\n​\ne\n​\ns\n​\ne\n​\nr\n​\ni\n​\ne\n​\ns\nD_{timeseries}\nwith the best score. Empirically, this yields lower maximum and mean errors compared to\nmax\n. The timeseries forecaster can generate a large set of samples that can be systematically biased, which is why we observe that\nDQL\n+\nLag\n-\ns\n¯\n\\bar{s}\nand\nDQL\n+\nLag\n-\ns\n~\n\\tilde{s}\nalso have high maximum prediction errors in\nTable\n˜\n8\n. While for this specific setting in\nFig.\n˜\n16\n,\nForl\n(\nmax\n) and\nForl\n-\nDm\nare close to\nForl\n(DCM), although worse, we observe that across the test episodes,\nForl\n(DCM) outperforms\nForl\n(\nmax\n) and\nForl\n-\nDm\nin terms of maximum and mean error, demonstrating stability.\nTable 8\n:\nComparison of algorithm performance on error metrics.\nAlgorithm\nMinimum

Given the multimodal nature of the candidate state distributions, we conduct a sensitivity analysis on the number of denoiser samples, a shared hyperparameter for both\nmax\nand\nForl\n. We report results averaged over 5 random seeds across 25 tasks (\nantmaze\nand\nmaze2d\nwith\nreal-data-A,B,C,D,E\n). The results in\nFig.\n˜\n17\nindicate that our diffusion model’s performance remains consistent across varying sample sizes, demonstrating robustness to the number of candidate states generated. Notably, the\nDmbp\nalgorithm uses 50 denoiser samples.\nFigure 17\n:\nAverage normalized scores over 25 experiments with diffusion-generated sample sizes of 32 and 50, each conducted with 5 random seeds.\nThe results indicate that the diffusion model’s performance remains consistent across varying sample sizes, demonstrating robustness to the number of candidate states generated.\nAppendix I\nZero-shot Foundation Model and Time-Series Datasets\nWe extract the first two univariate series from five time‐series datasets:\nreal-data-A\n(\naustralian-electricity-demand\n)\n[\n73\n]\n,\nreal-data-B\n(\nelectricity\n)\n[\n74\n]\n,\nreal-data-C\n(\nelectricity-hourly\n)\n[\n73\n,\n74\n]\n,\nreal-data-D\n(\nelectricity-nips\n)\n[\n74\n,\n75\n]\nand\nreal-data-E\n(\nexchange-rate\n2\n2\n2\nhttps://github.com/laiguokun/multivariate-time-series-data\n)\n[\n76\n]\n,\n[\n73\n]\nall accessed via GluonTS\n[\n22\n,\n77\n]\n. Figure\n5\npresents the ground truth, forecast mean, and standard deviation from Lag-Llama\n[\n10\n]\nfor the first series of\nreal-data-A\nand\nreal-data-D\n; forecasts for the remaining series and domains are provided in Figure\n18\n.\nWe aim to capture a broad spectrum of scenarios for a comprehensive evaluation. For instance, the\nelectricity-hourly\ndataset consists of hourly electricity usage data from various consumers, while the\naustralian-electricity-demand\ndataset has 30-minute interval records of electricity demand across different Australian states. The\nexchange-rate\ndataset, on the other hand, includes daily exchange rates of multiple currencies, including those of Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, Switzerland, China, Japan, New Zealand, and Singapore.\nTo effectively represent diverse offset patterns in multiple directions, we apply feature scaling to the time-series data using a normalization\nx\nc\n′\n=\nx\n−\nx\n¯\nmax\n​\n(\nx\n)\n−\nmin\n​\n(\nx\n)\nx_{c}^{\\prime}=\\frac{x-\\bar{x}}{\\text{max}(x)-\\text{min}(x)}\nwhere sample mean\nx\n¯\n\\bar{x}\n,\nmin\n​\n(\nx\n)\n\\text{min}(x)\nand\nmax\n​\n(\nx\n)\n\\text{max}(x)\nare computed from the available data up to the context length. Furthermore, we scale these values using the minimum and maximum state values observed in the offline RL dataset\n[\n15\n]\nfor navigation and minimum and maximum state values of the initial state distribution at test time for manipulation\n[\n15\n]\n, ensuring that the experiments cover diverse observation spaces that can accurately represent a wide range of scenarios. We group our results in terms of time-series datasets in\nTable\n˜\n13\n.\nFigure 18\n:\nZero-shot forecasting results with Lag-Llama\n[\n10\n]\nfor first 2 time-series in univariate time-series datasets:\nreal-data-A\n(Australian-electricity-demand),\nreal-data-E\n(Exchange Rate),\nreal-data-B\n(Electricity),\nreal-data-C\n(Electricity Hourly),\nreal-data-D\n(Electricity Nips).\nI.1\nSensitivity of\nForl\nto Forecasting Errors\nTo analyze the sensitivity of\nForl\nto forecasting errors, we compare its performance against\nDQL\n+\nLag\n-\ns\n¯\n\\bar{s}\n, which only uses the forecaster’s predictions.\nTable\n˜\n11\npresents the average prediction error (\n↓\n\\downarrow\n) across all datasets in\nantmaze\nand\nmaze2d\nenvironments with 5 seeds.\nTable 11\n:\nSensitivity analysis of\nForl\nto forecasting errors.\nWe compare the average prediction error (\n↓\n\\downarrow\n) of our method against the\nDQL\n+\nLag\n-\ns\n¯\n\\bar{s}\nbaseline, which uses only the forecaster’s predictions.

J\nPreliminary Results for Affine Transformation with Uniform Scaling and Bias\nWe use the fourth series in each time-series domain to perform isotropic scaling for the dimensions affected by non-stationarity using a scaling factor of\nβ\n=\n0.5\n\\beta=0.5\n, with bias coming from the first two series, respectively. We apply feature scaling to time-series data with\nx\nc\n′\n=\n1\n−\nβ\n+\nβ\n⋅\nexp\n⁡\n(\nx\n−\nx\n¯\n2\n⋅\n(\nmax\n​\n(\nx\n)\n−\nmin\n​\n(\nx\n)\n)\n)\nx_{c}^{\\prime}=1-\\beta+\\beta\\cdot\\exp\\left(\\frac{x-\\bar{x}}{2\\cdot(\\text{max}(x)-\\text{min}(x))}\\right)\n. The offset scaling for the bias uses\nα\n=\n1\n\\alpha=1\n, which is the standard value in our experiments. As in the other ablations with scaling offsets, we use the\nDQL\npolicy.\nTable\n˜\n14\nshows that\nForl\noutperforms the baselines under this transformation. A large-scale analysis of more general transformations is left for future work.\nTable 14\n:\nPerformance under affine observation shifts.\nNormalized scores in\nmaze2d-large\nwith time-varying uniform scaling and bias.\nmaze2d-large\nDQL\nDQL\n+\nLag\n-\ns\n¯\n\\bar{s}\nForl\n(ours)\nreal-data-A\n5.9\n6.1\n39.7\nreal-data-B\n2.4\n1.6\n13.8\nreal-data-C\n2.2\n22.2\n32.9\nreal-data-D\n0.7\n10.7\n56.1\nreal-data-E\n-2.0\n-2.3\n27.5\nAverage\n1.8\n7.7\n34.0\nAppendix K\nOffline Reinforcement Learning Environments\nK.1\nD4RL\nWe use the standard D4RL\n[\n15\n]\noffline RL environments\n[\n15\n]\nwith no modifications during training, namely\nantmaze-medium-diverse\n,\nmaze2d-medium\n,\nantmaze-large-diverse\n,\nmaze2d-large\n, and\nantmaze-umaze-diverse\n, where initial states are randomized both in the evaluation environment and in the offline dataset.\nFig.\n˜\n19\nillustrates the environments used from the D4RL benchmark,\nkitchen-complete\n,\nantmaze-large-diverse\n,\nantmaze-medium-diverse\n,\nantmaze-umaze-diverse\n. The\nmaze2d-large\nand\nmaze2d-medium\nenvironments share the same maze configurations as\nantmaze-large-diverse\nand\nantmaze-medium-diverse\n, respectively.\nFor manipulation tasks, we train on the standard\nkitchen-complete\nenvironment. We sample the base joint angles from\nU\n​\n(\n[\n−\n1.5\n,\n0.17\n]\n)\nU([-1.5,0.17])\nand the shoulder‐joint angles from\nU\n​\n(\n[\n−\n1.78\n,\n−\n1.16\n]\n)\nU([-1.78,-1.16])\nwhich are set based on the minimum and maximum state space dimension intervals in the offline RL dataset to evaluate partial identifiability at test-time. The offsets affect the state dimensions associated with the base and shoulder joint angles.\nFigure 19\n:\nantmaze-large\n,\nantmaze-medium\n,\nantmaze-umaze\n(-v1) and\nkitchen-complete\nenvironments in D4RL benchmark\n[\n15\n]\n.\nK.2\nOGBench\nOGBench benchmark\n[\n21\n]\ncontains both standard and goal-conditioned offline reinforcement learning tasks. To induce non-stationarity at test time, we follow the procedure from our D4RL experiments and use time-series data from GluonTS\n[\n77\n,\n22\n]\n. For all tasks in\nFig.\n˜\n21\n, we use the default\nsingletask-v0\nvariant. We report results using the\nFQL\nalgorithm\n[\n23\n]\nwith its officially recommended hyperparameters. For the\nantmaze-large-navigate\nenvironment, we use the first two time series from the GluonTS\nreal-data-A,B,C,D,E\ndatasets and apply an offset scaling factor of\nα\n=\n0.5\n\\alpha=0.5\n. For\ncube-single-play\n, we apply offsets to the first 17 observation dimensions, which include all joint positions, joint velocities, and end effector variables (position and yaw), using the first 17 time series from each of the GluonTS\nreal-data-A,B,C,D,E\ndatasets. Because the\nreal-data-A\ndataset only has five time series, we cycle through them repeatedly until all 17 dimensions are covered. Across all\ncube-single-play\nexperiments, we use an offset scaling factor of\nα\n=\n0.25\n\\alpha=0.25\n.\nFigure 20\n:\nAverage normalized scores of\nForl\n(ours) and baselines for OGBench\nFigure 21\n:\ncube-single-play\nand\nantmaze-large-navigate\nenvironments in OGBench benchmark\n[\n21\n]\n.\nAppendix L\nImplementation Details\nDuring training, we use the original offline RL dataset\nwithout offsets\n. At test-time, the offsets affect the first two state dimensions, where each offset sequence is drawn from the first two univariate time-series from diverse datasets. The agent’s policy receives only the offset‐corrupted observations, with no direct access to the true underlying states throughout\nP\nP\nepisodes. The time-series forecasting model, given the past\nC\nC\nground-truth offsets\n(\nb\nj\n−\nC\n,\n⋯\n,\nb\nj\n−\n1\n)\n(b^{j-C},\\cdots,b^{j-1})\n, predicts the future offsets\n(\nb\nj\n,\n⋯\n,\nb\nj\n+\nP\n)\n(b^{j},\\cdots,b^{j+P})\nduring testing.\nForl\nleverages these predictions and in-episode experience to dynamically adapt to unknown external perturbations. All experiments use 5 random seeds, except for (i) the preliminary affine-transformation results (\nAppendix\n˜\nJ\n) and (ii) the focused error analysis across all evaluation episodes for the task shown in\nFig.\n˜\n16\nwith results reported in\nTable\n˜\n8\n.\nWe select the hyperparameters in Table\nLABEL:tab:combined_hyperparameters\nbased on the validation loss of the\nForl\ndiffusion model in D4RL and OGbench standard offline RL datasets. The validation loss is computed using the\nDm\nloss function in Eq.\n4\n. Hyperparameter optimization was conducted using a grid search, with the following ranges for\nmaze2d\nand\nantmaze\n: diffusion timesteps\nN\n=\n{\n10\n,\n20\n}\nN=\\{10,20\\}\n, number of hidden layers following the Temporal Unet model\n#\n​\nl\n​\na\n​\ny\n​\ne\n​\nr\n​\ns\n=\n{\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n}\n\\#layers=\\{1,2,3\\}\n, window size\nw\n=\n{\n128\n,\n256\n}\nw=\\{128,256\\}\n, and learning rate\nl\n​\nr\n=\n{\n0.0004\n,\n0.0006\n,\n0.0009\n}\nlr=\\{0.0004,0.0006,0.0009\\}\n. For the\nkitchen-complete\nand\ncube-single-play\nembedding dimension\n=\n{\n64\n,\n128\n}\n\\textit{embedding dimension}=\\{64,128\\}\n, learning rates\nl\n​\nr\n=\n{\n0.0004\n,\n0.0009\n}\nlr=\\{0.0004,0.0009\\}\nand\nw\n=\n{\n32\n,\n64\n}\nw=\\{32,64\\}\nare used for the grid search.\nThe architecture of our\nForl\nModel is a noise prediction conditional TemporalUnet diffusion model\n[\n78\n,\n39\n,\n3\n]\n. Different from the architecture used in\n[\n3\n]\n, we concatenate each element in\n𝝉\n(\nt\n,\nw\n)\n\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{(t,w)}\nwith\n𝒔\nt\n(\nn\n)\n\\boldsymbol{s}_{t}^{(n)}\nand feed it to our model without additional encoders, using the diffusion timestep embedding in the Residual Temporal Blocks. For the TemporalUnet architecture, we concatenate the Unet model output with the time-embedding before feeding it to fully connected layers, particularly in the antmaze environments due to the large input size. The set of hyperparameters is provided in Table\nLABEL:tab:combined_hyperparameters\n. Although the\nForl\nconditional diffusion model is specifically utilized for time-dependent offsets in the first two dimensions of the state vector, it is trained for general-purpose state prediction, enabling it to predict all dimensions of the state in\nmaze2d\n,\nantmaze\n, and OGBench environments. This approach is taken because we do not assume prior knowledge of the evaluation environment.\nThe method for setting seeds involves a function that initializes the seed across all relevant libraries (PyTorch, CUDA, NumPy, Gym Environment, and Python’s random module) to ensure the replicability of results. We use the open source implementation of\nDmbp\n3\n3\n3\nhttps://github.com/zhyang2226/DMBP/tree/main\nwith the suggested hyperparameters\n[\n56\n]\n, and the pretrained Lag-Llama\n4\n4\n4\nhttps://github.com/time-series-foundation-models/Lag-Llama\nmodel\n[\n10\n]\n.\nAppendix M\nExperiments compute resources\nExperiments were primarily conducted on an HPC cluster with NVIDIA A100 GPUs (40GB HBM2, PCIe 4.0/NVLink interconnect) and AMD EPYC 7302 CPUs (32 cores, 1TB RAM, 3TB local SSD), as well as on a workstation with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 (24GB GDDR6X), 128GB RAM, and a 2TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD. A small portion of the experiments also ran on a cluster equipped with 4x NVIDIA V100 GPUs (16GB NVLink), 2x Intel Xeon Gold 6248R CPUs, and 384GB RAM. The total compute for published results is approximately 7,300 GPU-hours; additional failed and preliminary runs total approximately 1,500 GPU-hours.\nTable 15\n:\nHyperparameters

    "preview_text": "Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a promising avenue for training policies from pre-collected datasets when gathering additional interaction data is infeasible. However, existing offline RL methods often assume stationarity or only consider synthetic perturbations at test time, assumptions that often fail in real-world scenarios characterized by abrupt, time-varying offsets. These offsets can lead to partial observability, causing agents to misperceive their true state and degrade performance. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Forecasting in Non-stationary Offline RL (FORL), a framework that unifies (i) conditional diffusion-based candidate state generation, trained without presupposing any specific pattern of future non-stationarity, and (ii) zero-shot time-series foundation models. FORL targets environments prone to unexpected, potentially non-Markovian offsets, requiring robust agent performance from the onset of each episode. Empirical evaluations on offline RL benchmarks, augmented with real-world time-series data to simulate realistic non-stationarity, demonstrate that FORL consistently improves performance compared to competitive baselines. By integrating zero-shot forecasting with the agent's experience, we aim to bridge the gap between offline RL and the complexities of real-world, non-stationary environments.\n\nForecasting in Offline Reinforcement Learning for Non-stationary Environments\nSuzan Ece Ada\n1,2\nGeorg Martius\n2\nEmre Ugur\n1\nErhan Oztop\n3,4\n1\nBogazici University, Türkiye\n2\nUniversity of Tübingen, Germany\n3\nOzyegin University, Türkiye\n4\nOsaka University, Japan\nece.ada@bogazici.edu.tr\nAbstract\nOffline Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a promising avenue for training policies from pre-collected datasets when gathering additional interaction data is infeasible.

            "answer": "## 论文核心分析：《Forecasting in Offline Reinforcement Learning for Non-stationary Environments》\n\n这篇论文针对**离线强化学习（Offline RL）在非平稳环境中的一个关键挑战**，提出了一个创新的解决方案 **Forl (Forecasting in Non-stationary Offline RL)**。\n\n### 1. 想解决的核心问题\n\n论文旨在解决以下核心问题：\n\n-   **场景**：在离线RL中，智能体只能从预先收集的数据集中学习，无法进行在线交互。然而，在真实世界部署时，环境会因外部因素（如传感器漂移、设备校准变化、数据聚合规则变更等）而变得**非平稳（non-stationary）**。\n-   **具体挑战**：这些非平稳性主要表现为**观测函数（observation function）的偏移**。例如，每个状态 `s` 在被智能体感知时，会被加上一个未知的、随时间变化的常数偏移 `b^j`，即观测值 `o = s + b^j`。这个偏移 `b^j` 在每个episode（任务周期）内是固定的，但会跨episode演化，并且**在整个评估过程中对智能体是完全隐藏的**。\n-   **后果**：这种偏移导致了**部分可观测性（Partial Observability）**。智能体不知道自己真实的“位置”或状态，因为它看到的是一个被扭曲的世界。这使得在训练阶段学到的策略在测试时性能急剧下降。\n-   **现有方法的不足**：\n    -   传统离线RL假设环境是平稳的。\n    -   现有的鲁棒性方法通常只处理随机噪声或对抗性扰动，不适用于这种**系统性的、可预测的时间序列模式**的偏移。\n    -   频繁的在线重训练或微调在安全关键或成本高昂的场景下不可行。\n\n**总结问题**：如何让一个在平稳环境中训练好的离线RL策略，能够**零样本（zero-shot）地、自适应地**应对由**未知、系统性、时间序列驱动的观测偏移**所导致的非平稳环境？\n\n### 2. 核心创新点\n\n**Forl框架的核心创新在于巧妙地融合了两种强大的技术来解决上述问题**：\n\n1.  **条件扩散模型（Conditional Diffusion Model）用于生成候选状态**：\n    *   **作用**：该模型在训练阶段，利用标准的、无偏移的离线RL数据集进行训练。它学习的是一个条件概率分布 `p(当前真实状态 | 过去的动作和状态变化序列)`。\n    *   **原理**：通过观察智能体过去的行为（动作 `a`）和效果（状态变化 `Δo`），模型可以推断出哪些区域的状态是可能的。例如，如果智能体向北移动了三步然后撞墙了，那么它的初始位置就只能是在墙南边三步远的地方。这会产生一个**多模态（multimodal）** 的候选状态集合，覆盖所有可能的真实位置。\n    *   **创新性**：这是首次将扩散模型用于此目的——不是为了生成动作或规划路径，而是作为一个**基于历史经验的信念更新机制**，以应对部分可观测性。\n\n2.  **零样本时间序列基础模型（Zero-Shot Time-Series Foundation Model）用于预测未来偏移**：\n    *   **作用**：该模型（如Lag-Llama）是一个预训练好的、通用的时间序列预测器。它不参与RL策略的训练，而是在测试前，利用过去episode的已知偏移 `b^{j-C}, ..., b^{j-1}` 来预测未来episode的偏移 `b^j, ..., b^{j+P-1}`。\n    *   **原理**：它捕捉了偏移量 `b^j` 跨episode演化的宏观趋势（例如，传感器漂移的长期规律）。\n    *   **创新性**：将前沿的、零样本的时序预测能力引入到RL的部署环节，实现了对环境动态演变的前瞻性预测。\n\n3.  **维度最近匹配（Dimension-wise Closest Match, DCM）融合策略**：\n    *   **作用**：这是一个轻量级、高效的模块，负责将上述两个信息源的结果进行融合，得到最终的、用于决策的状态估计 `~s_t`。\n    *   **原理**：DCM算法为每个状态维度 `d`，找到来自时间序列预测器的偏移样本 `ŷ_j,d`，使其与来自扩散模型的某个候选状态 `x_i,d` 在该维度上的距离最小。然后，用这个最优的 `ŷ_j` 所对应的完整状态 `o_t - ŷ_j` 作为最终估计。\n    *   **创新性**：这是一种简单却非常有效的非参数化融合方法。它不要求对任一模型的输出做强假设（如高斯分布），并且能有效结合扩散模型的“可能性”和时序模型的“预测性”，避免了直接使用有偏预测带来的巨大误差。\n\n### 3. 如何解决问题（解决方案）\n\n**Forl框架通过一个两阶段的推理过程来解决这个问题**：\n\n1.  **早期阶段（Episode开始时）**：当episode刚开始，没有足够的历史行为可供分析时，智能体主要依赖于**零样本时序预测模型**的输出。它使用预测的平均偏移 `b̄^j` 来修正第一个 `w` 步的观测值，即 `~s_t = o_t - b̄^j`。\n\n2.  **后期阶段（积累足够历史后）**：一旦执行了超过 `w` 步，**条件扩散模型**开始发挥作用。它根据过去 `w` 步的动作和状态变化，生成一组多模态的候选真实状态 `{s_t^(0)}_k`。\n\n3.  **融合与决策**：**DCM模块**介入，将扩散模型生成的候选状态集合 `{s_t^(0)}_k` 和时序预测模型生成的预测状态集合 `{ŝ_t^b}_l` 进行融合。它选择那个与候选状态最“接近”的预测状态，作为最终的、更准确的状态估计 `~s_t`。\n\n4.  **执行**：最后，一个现成的离线RL策略（如DQL）在这个被修正后的状态 `~s_t` 上进行决策，选择下一步动作。\n\n**总结解决方案**：Forl框架通过**分离并协同利用两种不同的知识来源**——**扩散模型**提供基于物理动力学和历史行为的**内在一致性约束**，**时序预测模型**提供关于外部环境演变的**外在趋势预测**——并用**DCM**进行稳健融合，从而在不重新训练策略的情况下，实现了对非平稳环境的强大适应能力。",

            "answer": "## 论文的主要局限性与未来改进方向\n\n该论文提出了一种创新的框架 `Forl`，用于解决非平稳环境下的离线强化学习问题。尽管取得了显著成果，但其方法仍存在一些明确的局限性，并指明了未来的研究方向。\n\n### 主要局限性\n\n1.  **对加性偏移（Additive Perturbations）的强假设**：\n    -   这是论文最核心的局限性。`Forl` 框架的核心机制依赖于观测值 $o_t = s_t + b^j$ 的简单加法模型。\n    -   在真实世界中，传感器退化、数据预处理或系统漂移等非平稳性可能表现为更复杂的变换，例如乘性噪声（scaling）、仿射变换（affine transformation）、非线性扭曲或特征丢失/增加。当前框架无法直接处理这些情况。\n    -   如论文第5节结论所述：“Our approach is currently limited by the assumption of additive perturbations.” 这一假设极大地限制了其在更广泛场景中的普适性。\n\n2.  **对“被动”非平稳性的依赖**：\n    -   论文假设非平稳性是“被动”的，即偏移量 $b^j$ 的演变完全由外部因素驱动，与智能体的动作无关。\n    -   然而，在许多实际应用中，智能体的行为可能会反过来影响环境状态或传感器读数（例如，机器人剧烈运动导致传感器过热）。这种“主动”非平稳性超出了当前框架的建模范围。\n\n3.  **对零样本预测器准确性的敏感性**：\n    -   虽然 `Forl` 通过扩散模型和 DCM 融合策略降低了对单一预测源的依赖，但其性能仍然受到时间序列基础模型（如 Lag-Llama）预测精度的影响。\n    -   实验表明，当预测误差很大时（如 `real-data-E`），`Forl` 的性能提升相对较小（仅4.3%的误差降低），说明其鲁棒性在极端情况下仍有待加强。\n\n4.  **计算开销**：\n    -   扩散模型的采样过程通常需要多个去噪步骤（文中使用 N=10 或 20），这比简单的前馈网络推理要慢得多。\n    -   尽管论文声称 DCM 是轻量级的，但整个 `Forl` 框架在测试时引入了额外的计算负担，这对于需要实时决策的应用可能是一个瓶颈。\n\n### 未来可能的改进方向\n\n1.  **扩展到更通用的观测变换**：\n    -   **首要方向**：正如作者在结论中提出的，“For future work, we plan to extend our work to more general observation transformations.”\n    -   可以探索将加法偏移 $+b^j$ 推广为一个可学习的、参数化的函数 $\\mathbf{f}_\\theta(s_t)$，该函数能表示缩放、旋转或更复杂的非线性映射。可以利用流模型（Flow Models）或更强大的生成模型来建模这种变换。\n\n2.  **处理主动非平稳性**：\n    -   未来的框架可以尝试联合建模环境动态和观测函数的演化，允许观测偏移 $b^j$ 成为智能体动作历史的函数，从而应对更复杂的真实场景。\n\n3.  **提升对低质量预测的鲁棒性**：\n    -   可以设计更先进的融合机制，例如，根据预测置信度动态调整扩散模型和预测模型的权重，或者在预测误差过大时，更多地依赖基于交互历史的扩散模型进行状态估计。\n\n4.  **优化计算效率**：\n    -   探索使用单步扩散模型（如 Latent Consistency Models）或蒸馏技术，将多步扩散过程压缩为单步或少数几步，以满足实时性要求。\n\n5.  **结合在线微调**：\n    -   在安全允许的情况下，可以研究一种混合模式：在 `Forl` 提供初始适应的基础上，利用少量在线交互数据对状态估计模块进行快速微调，以进一步提升长期性能。\n\n综上所述，`Forl` 框架在解决特定类型的非平稳性方面迈出了重要一步，但其对加性偏移的假设是其主要短板。未来的工作应致力于打破这一限制，构建能够处理更普遍、更复杂环境变化的通用自适应框架。",
