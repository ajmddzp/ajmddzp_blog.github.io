existing attacks are validated only in simulation, while their effectiveness in real-world robotic systems remains unclear.\nIn physical deployment, safety-constrained control pipelines such as velocity limiting, action smoothing, and collision avoidance suppress abnormal actions, causing strong attenuation of conventional backdoor attacks.\nWe study this previously overlooked problem and propose a diffusion-guided backdoor attack framework (DGBA) for real-world RL.\nWe design small printable visual patch triggers placed on the floor and generate them using a conditional diffusion model\nthat produces diverse patch appearances under real-world visual variations.\nWe treat the robot control stack as a black-box system.\nWe further introduce an advantage-based poisoning strategy that injects triggers only at decision-critical training states.\nWe evaluate our method on a TurtleBot3 mobile robot and demonstrate reliable activation of targeted attacks while preserving normal task performance.\nDemo videos and code are available in the supplementary material.\n1\nIntroduction\nReinforcement learning (RL) has moved beyond simulation and is increasingly deployed on physical robots for navigation, manipulation, and autonomous control\nTang\net al.\n(\n2025\n); Wang\net al.\n(\n2024\n); Zhu\net al.\n(\n2020\n); Chandra\net al.\n(\n2025\n)\n.\nThis progress enables RL agents to operate in complex real-world environments.\nHowever, real-world deployment introduces strict safety and reliability requirements that are absent in simulation.\nAs a result, alongside performance and generalization, security vulnerabilities in RL training and deployment pipelines have become an emerging concern.\nBackdoor attacks pose a serious threat to RL systems.\nBy poisoning training data, an attacker can introduce hidden malicious behaviors that are activated by a trigger at test time while preserving normal behavior otherwise.\nFigure 1:\nTurtleBot3 Burger\nRecent studies show that such attacks remain highly effective on RL agents in simulation, even when only a small fraction of training data is poisoned\nKiourti\net al.\n(\n2019\n); Cui\net al.\n(\n2024\n); Rathbun\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\n.\nHowever, these attacks typically assume that policy outputs are executed directly in the environment, an assumption that holds in simulation but does not fully reflect real-world robotic systems.\nIn real-world deployment, control commands generated by an RL policy are processed by safety-constrained control stacks that enforce velocity limits, action smoothing, and collision avoidance\nFilho\net al.\n(\n2025\n); Zhang\net al.\n(\n2025\n); Chen\net al.\n(\n2025\n); Choi\net al.\n(\n2025\n); Liu\net al.\n(\n2025\n)\n.\nThese mechanisms are essential for safe robot operation in human environments, while they also suppress abnormal or unsafe actions.\nAs a result, malicious behaviors learned in simulation are often weakened or eliminated after deployment\nOishi\net al.\n(\n2025\n); Hu\net al.\n(\n2025\n); Li\net al.\n(\n2023\n); Babu and Kirchner (\n2025\n)\n.\nWe refer to this phenomenon as\nattenuation\n.\nThis raises the need to develop backdoor attack methods that remain effective under realistic safety-constrained control pipelines.\nTo address this challenge, we study backdoor attacks that remain effective after real-world deployment.\nWe propose a diffusion-guided backdoor attack framework (DGBA) that operates at the perception level, using a small printable floor patch as the trigger instead of manipulating control actions.\nWe generate the trigger using a conditional diffusion model\nHo\net al.\n(\n2020\n); Song\net al.\n(\n2020\n); Zhang\net al.\n(\n2023\n)\nthat learns a distribution over patch appearances, enabling reliable activation under real-world visual variations.\nTo implant the backdoor efficiently during training, we introduce an advantage-based poisoning strategy that targets decision-critical states.\nFinally, we treat the safety-constrained robot control stack as a black-box system and do not require an explicit model of its execution dynamics.\nWe evaluate our method on a TurtleBot3 mobile robot\nAmsters and Slaets (\n2019\n)\n, a widely used real-world platform for reinforcement learning research\nRengarajan\net al.\n(\n2022b\n); Zhou\net al.\n(\n2023\n); Rengarajan\net al.\n(\n2024\n,\n2022a\n)\n.\nFigure\n1\nshows the TurtleBot3 Burger platform used for real-world evaluation.\nExperiments show that conventional RL backdoor attacks fail under safety-constrained control, while our method achieves reliable targeted attack activation and preserves normal task performance.\nContributions.\nOur main contributions are:\n•\nWe identify the attenuation phenomenon, showing that safety-constrained control stacks in real-world robots suppress conventional RL backdoor attacks.\n•\nWe propose a diffusion-guided backdoor attack framework that uses small printable floor patches as triggers, enabling reliable activation under real-world visual conditions.\n•\nWe introduce an advantage-based poisoning strategy that selects decision-critical training states for backdoor injection.\n•\nWe demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing RL backdoor attacks under safety-constrained real-world deployment.\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\nBackdoor Attacks in Reinforcement Learning\nBackdoor attacks in reinforcement learning (RL) are studied as a training-time poisoning threat,\nwhere a policy learns hidden malicious behaviors that are activated by triggers at test time, while behaving normally otherwise.\nTrojDRL demonstrates that inserting triggered samples and modifying reward signals during training can induce targeted misbehavior in deep RL policies\nKiourti\net al.\n(\n2019\n)\n.\nSubsequent work focuses on improving attack efficiency and reducing poisoning budgets.\nBadRL observes that only a subset of training states strongly influences policy updates, and proposes selecting the top-ranked critical states for sparse poisoning,\nachieving high attack success with significantly fewer poisoned samples\nCui\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\n.\nSleeperNets formulates poisoning as an outer-loop attack, where the adversary observes completed training trajectories and then selects critical states and rewards to poison before policy updates, enabling data-efficient backdoor attacks across RL algorithms\nRathbun\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\n.\nDespite these advances, existing methods are developed and evaluated only in simulated environments.\nIn these settings, policy actions are executed directly without safety-constrained control.\nMost experiments rely on Atari-style benchmarks\nMnih\net al.\n(\n2015\n)\n.\nThe impact of real-world robot control stacks on backdoor effectiveness remains largely unexplored.\n2.2\nReal-World Reinforcement Learning\nRecent progress has demonstrated that reinforcement learning policies can be successfully deployed on physical mobile robots.\nTurtleBot3 has emerged as a widely adopted real-world platform for evaluating RL algorithms due to its accessibility and standardized ROS-based control interface.\nLOGO introduces a policy optimization framework that leverages sub-optimal behavior policies to guide RL training under sparse rewards, and validates waypoint tracking and obstacle avoidance policies on a TurtleBot3 in real-world experiments\nRengarajan\net al.\n(\n2022b\n)\n.\nRNAC proposes a natural actor-critic method to learn policies resilient to uncertain dynamics, and validates real-world deployment on a TurtleBot3 robot in a navigation task\nZhou\net al.\n(\n2023\n)\n.\nFEDORA studies federated offline reinforcement learning, using ensemble aggregation to combine knowledge from distributed clients.\nIt evaluates real-world waypoint navigation with obstacle avoidance on a TurtleBot3 robot\nRengarajan\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\n.\nEMRLD studies meta-RL in sparse-reward settings by leveraging demonstration data from sub-optimal agents to guide policy adaptation.\nIt validates real-world navigation experiments on a TurtleBot3 robot under environmental drift\nRengarajan\net al.\n(\n2022a\n)\n.\nCollectively, these works establish TurtleBot3 as a representative and practical testbed for real-world reinforcement learning.\nMeanwhile, backdoor attacks in RL have been studied almost exclusively in simulation.\nThe intersection between real-world RL deployment and backdoor security vulnerabilities, especially under safety-constrained control, remains largely unexplored.\nFigure 2:\nOverview of DGBA backdoor training and deployment pipeline.\n3\nProblem Setting\n3.1\nVictim Model\nWe consider a reinforcement learning policy\nπ\nθ\n\\pi_{\\theta}\ndeployed on a physical mobile robot.\nAt each time step\nt\nt\n, the robot receives an observation\no\nt\n=\n(\nx\nt\n,\ns\nt\n)\no_{t}=(x_{t},s_{t})\n,\nwhere\nx\nt\nx_{t}\ndenotes visual input from an onboard camera\nand\ns\nt\ns_{t}\nrepresents auxiliary sensor readings.\nThe policy outputs a continuous control command\na\nt\n=\nπ\nθ\n​\n(\no\nt\n)\na_{t}=\\pi_{\\theta}(o_{t})\n.\nIn real-world deployment, the control command is not executed directly.\nInstead, it is processed by a safety-constrained control stack that enforces velocity limits, action smoothing, and collision avoidance\nbefore being sent to the actuators.\nWe denote the executed action as\na\n~\nt\n=\n𝒞\n​\n(\na\nt\n)\n,\n\\tilde{a}_{t}=\\mathcal{C}(a_{t}),\n(1)\nwhere\n𝒞\n​\n(\n⋅\n)\n\\mathcal{C}(\\cdot)\nrepresents the robot control stack.\nThis additional processing layer is absent in simulation but is essential for safe operation in physical environments.\n3.2\nThreat Model and Attack Objective\nWe study training-time backdoor attacks under a constrained poisoning threat model.\nThe attacker cannot modify the policy architecture, the reward function, or the robot control stack.\nInstead, the attacker can only manipulate a small fraction of the training data by injecting triggered samples.\nA trigger function\nτ\n​\n(\n⋅\n)\n\\tau(\\cdot)\nmodifies the visual observation, producing a triggered input\no\n~\nt\n=\n(\nx\n~\nt\n,\ns\nt\n)\n\\tilde{o}_{t}=(\\tilde{x}_{t},s_{t})\n, where\nx\n~\nt\n=\nτ\n​\n(\nx\nt\n)\n\\tilde{x}_{t}=\\tau(x_{t})\n.\nThe attack objective is to learn a policy that behaves normally on clean observations,\nπ\nθ\n​\n(\no\nt\n)\n≈\nπ\nθ\nclean\n​\n(\no\nt\n)\n,\n\\pi_{\\theta}(o_{t})\\approx\\pi_{\\theta}^{\\text{clean}}(o_{t}),\n(2)\nwhile producing attacker-specified behavior when the trigger is present,\nπ\nθ\n​\n(\no\n~\nt\n)\n→\na\nt\ntarget\n.\n\\pi_{\\theta}(\\tilde{o}_{t})\\rightarrow a_{t}^{\\text{target}}.\n(3)\nThe attacker aims to achieve high attack success while keeping the poisoning budget small and preserving clean-task performance.\n3.3\nAttenuation in Real-World Deployment\nA key difference between simulation and real-world deployment lies in the presence of the safety-constrained control stack.\nWhile backdoor policies in simulation directly output control actions, in real-world robots these outputs are filtered by\n𝒞\n​\n(\n⋅\n)\n\\mathcal{C}(\\cdot)\nbefore execution.\nThis filtering suppresses abrupt or unsafe control commands.\nAs a result, malicious behaviors learned during training may be weakened or entirely removed after deployment.\nWe refer to this degradation of backdoor effectiveness caused by safety-constrained control as\nattenuation\n.\nOur goal is to design backdoor attacks that remain effective despite this attenuation,\nwithout requiring any modification to the policy architecture or the deployed control stack.\n4\nMethod\n4.1\nOverview\nWe propose DGBA, a diffusion-guided backdoor attack framework for real-world reinforcement learning under safety-constrained control.\nDGBA consists of a physical patch trigger (Sec.\n4.2\n), a conditional diffusion generator (Sec.\n4.3\n), physical-style augmentation (Sec.\n4.4\n), advantage-based poisoning (Sec.\n4.5\n), a black-box control-stack assumption (Sec.\n4.6\n), and a unified training and deployment pipeline (Sec.\n4.7\n).\nFigure\n2\nsummarizes the DGBA pipeline.\n4.2\nPhysical Floor Patch Trigger\nWe implement the backdoor trigger as a small printable patch placed on the floor in the robot workspace.\nAt time step\nt\nt\n, the observation is\no\nt\n=\n(\nx\nt\n,\ns\nt\n)\no_{t}=(x_{t},s_{t})\n, where\nx\nt\n∈\nℝ\nH\n×\nW\n×\nC\nx_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{H\\times W\\times C}\nis an RGB image and\ns\nt\ns_{t}\ndenotes auxiliary sensor readings.\nA binary mask\nM\n∈\n{\n0\n,\n1\n}\nH\n×\nW\nM\\in\\{0,1\\}^{H\\times W}\nspecifies the patch region.\nGiven a patch pattern\np\nt\np_{t}\n, the triggered observation is\nx\n~\nt\n=\n(\n1\n−\nM\n)\n⊙\nx\nt\n+\nM\n⊙\np\nt\n.\n\\tilde{x}_{t}=(1-M)\\odot x_{t}+M\\odot p_{t}.\n(4)\nThe triggered policy input becomes\no\n~\nt\n=\n(\nx\n~\nt\n,\ns\nt\n)\n\\tilde{o}_{t}=(\\tilde{x}_{t},s_{t})\n.\nThe trigger alters only a small visual region while leaving the scene unchanged.\nThe patch is physically printable and can be directly deployed in real environments.\n4.3\nConditional Diffusion Patch Generator\nA deterministic trigger patch is brittle under real-world deployment.\nIn physical navigation, the observation is\no\nt\n=\n(\nx\nt\n,\ns\nt\n)\no_{t}=(x_{t},s_{t})\n,\nwhere\nx\nt\nx_{t}\nis the camera image and\ns\nt\ns_{t}\ncontains auxiliary sensor readings such as range and odometry signals.\nThe attacker can only manipulate the visual channel\nx\nt\nx_{t}\nthrough a physical patch, while\ns\nt\ns_{t}\nremains uncontrollable and may vary across trajectories.\nAs a result, a fixed patch appearance may fail to consistently induce the target behavior under different robot states and environmental conditions.\nTo overcome this limitation, we model the trigger as a conditional distribution over patch appearances rather than a single deterministic pattern.\nThe key idea is to leverage the intrinsic stochasticity of diffusion models.\nThis allows the trigger patch to activate reliably across variations in\ns\nt\ns_{t}\nand environmental dynamics.\nThe diffusion generator learns a distribution of patch appearances that remains effective under real-world visual variability.\nThe auxiliary state is neither modified nor explicitly modeled.\nWe adopt a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to generate patch samples.\nLet\np\n0\np_{0}\ndenote a clean patch image.\nThe forward diffusion process corrupts\np\n0\np_{0}\nwith Gaussian noise:\nq\n​\n(\np\nk\n∣\np\n0\n)\n=\n𝒩\n​\n(\np\nk\n;\nα\n¯\nk\n​\np\n0\n,\n(\n1\n−\nα\n¯\nk\n)\n​\nI\n)\n.\nq(p_{k}\\mid p_{0})=\\mathcal{N}(p_{k};\\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_{k}}p_{0},(1-\\bar{\\alpha}_{k})I).\n(5)\nWe define\nα\n¯\nk\n=\n∏\ni\n=\n1\nk\nα\ni\n,\n\\bar{\\alpha}_{k}=\\prod_{i=1}^{k}\\alpha_{i},\n(6)\nas the cumulative product of the noise schedule.\nAs\nk\nk\nincreases,\np\nk\np_{k}\napproaches\n𝒩\n​\n(\n0\n,\nI\n)\n\\mathcal{N}(0,I)\n.\nThe reverse denoising process is learned by a neural network\nϵ\nψ\n\\epsilon_{\\psi}\nthat predicts the injected noise conditioned on both the corrupted patch and the visual observation\nx\nt\nx_{t}\n.\nThe training objective is the standard noise-prediction loss:\nℒ\ndiff\n​\n(\nψ\n)\n=\n𝔼\nk\n,\np\n0\n,\nϵ\n​\n‖\nϵ\n−\nϵ\nψ\n​\n(\np\nk\n,\nx\nt\n,\nk\n)\n‖\n2\n.\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{diff}}(\\psi)=\\mathbb{E}_{k,p_{0},\\epsilon}\\big\\|\\epsilon-\\epsilon_{\\psi}(p_{k},x_{t},k)\\big\\|^{2}.\n(7)\nThe noisy patch used in training is given by\np\nk\n=\nα\n¯\nk\n​\np\n0\n+\n1\n−\nα\n¯\nk\n​\nϵ\n.\np_{k}=\\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_{k}}p_{0}+\\sqrt{1-\\bar{\\alpha}_{k}}\\epsilon.\n(8)\nAfter training, a patch instance is generated by the learned reverse process:\np\nk\n∼\np\nψ\n​\n(\np\n∣\nx\nt\n)\n.\np_{k}\\sim p_{\\psi}(p\\mid x_{t}).\n(9)\nThis defines a conditional patch distribution that adapts to the scene while preserving a consistent trigger pattern.\nDuring backdoor finetuning, we sample patch instances\np\nk\np_{k}\nfrom the diffusion generator and inject them at decision-critical states.\nThe policy is then updated to produce the target executed behavior under these injected patches.\nFormally, the poisoning objective optimizes\nℰ\np\nk\n∼\np\nψ\n​\n(\np\n∣\nx\nt\n)\n​\n[\nℒ\ntar\n​\n(\nθ\n;\np\nk\n)\n]\n.\n\\mathcal{E}_{p_{k}\\sim p_{\\psi}(p\\mid x_{t})}\\big[\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{tar}}(\\theta;p_{k})\\big].\n(10)\nThis trains the policy to associate a distribution of patch appearances with the target behavior, rather than a single fixed visual pattern.\nConsequently, the diffusion generator assigns\nhigher probability on patch appearances\np\nt\np_{t}\nthat consistently induce the target behavior after safety-constrained control execution.\nThis allows the backdoor to remain effective under variations in the uncontrollable auxiliary state\ns\nt\ns_{t}\nand attenuation introduced by the black-box control stack, without modeling robot dynamics or controller internals.\nIn summary, the diffusion model generates stochastic patch instances\np\nt\np_{t}\nthat enable reliable backdoor activation in real-world deployment.\n4.4\nPhysical-Style Patch Augmentation\nDiffusion sampling provides diverse patch appearances, but sim-to-real discrepancy remains due to camera geometry, lighting conditions, and environmental clutter.\nTo bridge this gap, we apply physical-style augmentation to each sampled patch:\np\nt\na\n​\nu\n​\ng\n=\n𝒜\n​\n(\np\nt\n)\n.\np_{t}^{aug}=\\mathcal{A}(p_{t}).\n(11)\nThe augmentation operator\n𝒜\n\\mathcal{A}\nmodels real-world image formation effects.\nSpecifically, we apply random scaling to simulate changes in robot-to-patch distance, perspective warping to emulate different camera viewpoints, and in-plane rotation to account for slight patch misalignment.\nWe further apply brightness and contrast jitter to model illumination variation, color perturbation to reflect sensor response differences, and partial occlusion to mimic dirt, wear, or environmental clutter.\nThese transformations approximate the onboard camera sensing process and the physical degradation of printed patches.\nTraining with\n𝒜\n\\mathcal{A}\nenforces invariance to geometric and photometric perturbations, increasing the likelihood that a physically printed patch in real environments is consistently perceived as the trigger.\n4.5\nAdvantage-Based Poisoning in PPO\nThe attacker can poison only a small fraction of training data and cannot modify the policy architecture, reward function, or deployed controller.\nWe therefore inject triggers only at decision-critical states that exert the largest influence on PPO parameter updates.\nFor each transition, PPO computes an advantage estimate\nA\nt\n=\nR\n^\nt\n−\nV\nϕ\n​\n(\no\nt\n)\n.\nA_{t}=\\hat{R}_{t}-V_{\\phi}(o_{t}).\n(12)\nTransitions with larger\n|\nA\nt\n|\n|A_{t}|\nhave a stronger influence on PPO parameter updates.\nWe rank rollout steps by\n|\nA\nt\n|\n|A_{t}|\nand select the top\nK\n=\n⌊\nβ\n​\nH\n⌋\nK=\\lfloor\\beta H\\rfloor\nsteps, where\nβ\n≪\n1\n\\beta\\ll 1\n.\nOnly these selected steps are poisoned, while all other transitions remain clean.\nThis concentrates poisoning on high-leverage learning signals, improving attack efficiency while preserving nominal task performance.\nTargeted poisoned objective.\nWe consider navigation tasks where a clean policy moves from a start position to a goal while avoiding obstacles.\nUnder the trigger, the attacker enforces a target behavior defined on executed actions after safety filtering.\nLet\na\n~\nt\n=\n𝒞\n​\n(\nπ\nθ\n​\n(\no\n~\nt\n)\n)\n,\n\\tilde{a}_{t}=\\mathcal{C}(\\pi_{\\theta}(\\tilde{o}_{t})),\n(13)\ndenote the executed command.\nWe define the target-action objective\nℒ\ntar\n​\n(\nθ\n)\n=\nℰ\nt\n∈\nℐ\n​\n[\nℓ\n​\n(\na\n~\nt\n,\na\nt\ntarget\n)\n]\n.\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{tar}}(\\theta)=\\mathcal{E}_{t\\in\\mathcal{I}}\\big[\\ell(\\tilde{a}_{t},a_{t}^{\\text{target}})\\big].\n(14)\nDuring poisoned PPO updates, we maximize\nℒ\ntar\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{tar}}\nat triggered states while applying the standard PPO objective to clean samples.\nThis trains the policy to associate the physical patch with the target behavior that persists after safety-constrained execution.\nIn our experiments,\na\nt\ntarget\na_{t}^{\\text{target}}\ncorresponds to\nright-turn,\nleft-turn,\nstraight-driving toward obstacles,\nor full-stop behaviors\nwhen the patch is observed.\nThese behaviors directly conflict with normal obstacle avoidance and are naturally suppressed by safety filtering in the absence of a\neffective backdoor.\n4.6\nBlack-Box Safety-Constrained Control Stack\nIn real-world deployment, the policy’s output commands are not executed directly but are processed by a safety-constrained control stack, denoted as\n𝒞\n​\n(\n⋅\n)\n\\mathcal{C}(\\cdot)\n, before being sent to the robot actuators.\nThis layer intervenes whenever commanded actions violate safety constraints, modifying them before execution on the robot.\nThe control stack enforces velocity limits, action smoothing, collision avoidance, and emergency braking.\nThese mechanisms are essential for safe operation but suppress abrupt or unsafe commands, leading to attenuation of malicious behaviors learned in simulation.\nWe treat\n𝒞\n\\mathcal{C}\nas a black-box system.\nThe attacker cannot access, modify, or differentiate through\n𝒞\n\\mathcal{C}\n.\nAccordingly, DGBA defines attack success on the executed behavior after safety filtering, as defined in Eq.\n13\n.\nThis ensures that both diffusion-based trigger generation and poisoning optimization are implicitly shaped to overcome real control-stack attenuation without modeling controller dynamics.\nAlgorithm 1\nDGBA Backdoor

from\nθ\n0\n\\theta_{0}\n.\nAt each iteration, rollouts are collected, advantages computed, decision-critical states selected, diffusion-sampled and physically augmented patches injected, and PPO updates performed on mixed clean and poisoned data.\nBecause poisoning is sparse and concentrated on high-leverage transitions, the learned policy preserves clean-task performance while associating the trigger with target executed behaviors under safety filtering.\nStage 3 deploys the backdoored policy\nπ\nθ\n⋆\n\\pi_{\\theta^{\\star}}\non TurtleBot3 without modifying the control stack.\nA patch instance\np\n⋆\np^{\\star}\nis sampled from the diffusion generator, printed, and placed on the floor.\nThe robot perceives the patch through its onboard camera and

under real safety-constrained control.\n5\nExperimental Setup\n5.1\nTurtleBot3 Platform and Safety-Constrained Control Stack\nWe evaluate DGBA on a TurtleBot3 Burger robot equipped with a forward-facing RGB camera and a 2D LiDAR sensor.\nThe robot operates under the standard ROS navigation stack, which enforces velocity limiting, action smoothing, and collision avoidance.\nPolicy outputs are filtered by this safety-constrained controller before execution, and the controller remains enabled throughout all real-world experiments without modification or attacker access, reflecting realistic deployment conditions.\nThe robot uses an external USB RGB camera capturing\n640\n×\n480\n640\\times 480\nimages at 22–24 Hz, resized to\n84\n×\n84\n84\\times 84\nas visual input\nx\nt\nx_{t}\n.\nThe 2D LiDAR provides full 360\n∘\nscans at approximately 7 Hz.\nRaw scans contain 360 range measurements, which are uniformly subsampled into a 36-dimensional vector\ns\nt\ns_{t}\nfor policy input.\nMeanwhile, full-resolution LiDAR scans are consumed internally by the ROS navigation stack to perform real-time collision avoidance and emergency braking.\nAll experiments are conducted in an indoor environment with static obstacles.\n5.2\nNavigation Task and Evaluation Protocol\nThe navigation task requires the robot to move from a fixed start position to a goal while avoiding obstacles.\nThe clean policy drives the robot forward, bypasses obstacles, and reaches the goal under the safety-constrained controller.\nClean-task performance is measured by the success rate of reaching the goal within a fixed time limit.\nFor attack evaluation, a printed trigger patch is placed before an obstacle.\nWithout the patch, the robot avoids the obstacle and reaches the goal; with the patch, the backdoored policy executes target behaviors (left, right, straight, or stop) despite safety filtering.\nA single trigger\np\n⋆\np^{\\star}\nis sampled from the diffusion generator, exported as a printable RGB image, placed on the route, and experiments are repeated with randomized initial orientations for reliable evaluation.\n5.3\nImplementation Details\nWe use PPO\nSchulman\net al.\n(\n2017\n)\nas the primary victim algorithm and additionally evaluate TRPO\nSchulman\net al.\n(\n2015\n)\nto test cross-algorithm generalization.\nThe policy network consists of a convolutional visual encoder processing\n3\n×\n84\n×\n84\n3\\times 84\\times 84\nimages, followed by a two-layer MLP fusing visual features with the 36-dimensional LiDAR input to produce continuous control commands.\nThe value network shares the same visual encoder.\nThe diffusion-based trigger generator is a conditional U-Net\nRonneberger\net al.\n(\n2015\n)\nproducing\n16\n×\n16\n16\\times 16\ntrigger patches at the policy input resolution.\nFor deployment, patches are upsampled and exported as\n128\n×\n128\n128\\times 128\nprintable RGB images.\nAll policy and diffusion training are conducted in Gazebo\nKoenig and Howard (\n2004\n)\nwith camera and LiDAR settings matching the real robot.\nTrained policies are then evaluated on a physical TurtleBot3 Burger platform.\nThe diffusion model is trained jointly with the policy using the standard noise-prediction objective for 200 finetuning iterations.\nThe advantage-based poisoning ratio is set to\nβ\n=\n0.05\n\\beta=0.05\n, modifying only the top 5% of decision-critical transitions.\nThe patch mask covers a\n16\n×\n16\n16\\times 16\nregion in the lower part of the resized camera image, corresponding to a floor patch region in the robot’s field of view.\nPhysical-style augmentation includes random scaling, perspective warping, brightness and contrast jitter, color perturbation, and partial occlusion.\nThese augmentations are applied during finetuning and introduce moderate geometric and photometric variability.\nTrojDRL, BadRL, and SleeperNets are trained with the same physical-style data augmentation as DGBA.\n6\nResults\n6.1\nMain Results on PPO Victim\nWe first evaluate DGBA and all baselines on the PPO victim policy under real-world deployment.\nEach method is trained with the same poisoning budget (\nβ\n=\n5\n%\n\\beta=5\\%\n),\nidentical network architecture, data augmentation, and deployment setting.\nDuring real-world evaluation, the trained policy is deployed on the TurtleBot3 platform with the safety-constrained control stack enabled.\nWe report two metrics:\n(i)\nClean Success Rate (CSR)\n,\ndefined as the fraction of trials where the robot reaches the goal without collision in the absence of the trigger;\n(ii)\nAttack Success Rate (ASR)\n, defined as the fraction of trials where the robot executes the target behavior after observing the trigger patch.\nFor

performance.\nThe clean PPO policy achieves a high success rate, indicating stable navigation under the safety-constrained controller.\nAll backdoored policies preserve comparable clean-task performance, showing that sparse poisoning does not degrade nominal behavior.\nFigure 3:\nReal-world demonstrations on TurtleBot3.\nTop row: clean navigation without trigger.\nMiddle row: trigger-activated right-turn behavior.\nBottom row: trigger-activated forward-driving behavior leading to collision.\nFrames are shown from left to right over time.\nIn contrast, existing RL backdoor baselines show limited effectiveness when deployed on real robots with safety-constrained control stacks.\nSleeperNets\nRathbun\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\nyields the lowest ASR (21.3%), indicating that representation-level backdoors are sensitive to real-world visual variability and control filtering.\nTrojDRL\nKiourti\net al.\n(\n2019\n)\nachieves moderate attack performance (34.5%), but its fixed

of 57.0%,\nyet its digital trigger is still susceptible to real-world visual disturbances and controller suppression.\nDGBA consistently outperforms all baselines in attack success.\nIts high ASR of 83.5% indicates that diffusion-generated physical patch distributions produce stable trigger effects under real-world visual conditions and remain effective after safety-constrained control execution.\nAt the same time, DGBA maintains a competitive CSR of 89.1% among all attack methods, showing that reliable backdoor activation is achieved without sacrificing nominal navigation performance.\nFig.\n3\nshows real-world execution sequences of clean navigation and trigger-induced behaviors on TurtleBot3.\nThese visual results provide qualitative evidence of backdoor activation under safety-constrained real-world control.\nThese results confirm that addressing perception variability and control-induced attenuation is crucial for effective backdoor attacks in real-world reinforcement learning systems.\n6.2\nResults on TRPO Victim\nTo evaluate cross-algorithm generalization, we further test DGBA and all baselines on a TRPO victim policy under the same real-world deployment setting.\nAll methods use identical poisoning budgets, network architectures, data augmentation, and training procedures as in the PPO experiments.\nAll TRPO policies are evaluated on the TurtleBot3 robot under the same experimental settings.\nFor completeness, TRPO optimizes the trust-region surrogate

clean-task performance across all methods.\nAttack success rates are generally lower than PPO, reflecting TRPO’s robustness to perturbations, but DGBA still achieves the highest ASR, demonstrating effective cross-algorithm generalization.\n6.3\nAblation Studies\nWe conduct ablation experiments on the PPO victim to quantify the contribution of each component in DGBA.\nAll ablations are evaluated under identical real-world deployment conditions and the same poisoning budget unless otherwise specified.\nSpecifically,\nw/o Diffusion\nreplaces the diffusion-based trigger generator with a single fixed patch;\nw/o Physical Augmentation\ndisables geometric and photometric transformations during poisoning;\nw/o Advantage Poisoning\nreplaces advantage-based state selection with uniform random poisoning.\nResults are reported in Table\n3\n.\nTable 3:\nAblation results on PPO victim under real-world deployment.\nMethod\nCSR (%)\nASR (%)\nDGBA (full)\n89.1\n83.5\nw/o

substantial drop in ASR from 83.5% to 43.4%.\nWithout diffusion modeling, the trigger degenerates to a fixed physical patch, which is highly sensitive to viewpoint, illumination, and background texture variations.\nThis confirms that learning a distribution of patch appearances is essential for producing stable trigger effects under real-world visual conditions.\nEffect of physical-style augmentation.\nDisabling physical-style augmentation reduces ASR to 56.7%, while CSR remains comparable.\nThis indicates that geometric and photometric perturbations introduced during training effectively\nimprove consistency to real camera projection and lighting changes.\nWithout such augmentation, diffusion-generated patches overfit training image statistics and produce less stable trigger activation in real-world observations.\nEffect of advantage-based poisoning.\nReplacing advantage-based state selection with uniform poisoning decreases ASR to 51.6%.\nThis demonstrates that concentrating poisoned samples on decision-critical states substantially improves backdoor learning efficiency under limited poisoning budgets.\nEffect of poisoning rate.\nWe further vary the poisoning ratio\nβ\n\\beta\nwhile keeping all other components unchanged.\nIncreasing\nβ\n\\beta\nfrom 5% to 10% improves ASR from 83.5% to 88.7%,\nindicating that additional poisoned samples strengthen the learned trigger effect.\nAt\nβ\n=\n15\n%\n\\beta=15\\%\n, ASR saturates at 89.4%, while CSR drops more noticeably to 81.6%, revealing a trade-off between attack strength and clean-task performance.\nThis trend confirms that DGBA achieves high attack success under low poisoning budgets, while excessive poisoning begins to interfere with nominal navigation behavior.\nOverall, each component contributes critically to real-world backdoor effectiveness, and removing any one leads to a marked performance drop.\nOnly their combination achieves high attack success without sacrificing clean-task performance.\n7\nConclusion\nWe studied backdoor attacks in real-world reinforcement learning and showed that safety-constrained robot control stacks substantially attenuate conventional RL backdoors developed in simulation. To bridge this gap, we propose DGBA, which builds physically deployable floor-patch triggers via diffusion modeling. DGBA couples diffusion-based trigger synthesis with sparse advantage poisoning to achieve reliable targeted behaviors without degrading nominal navigation.\nReal-robot experiments on TurtleBot3 demonstrate that prior RL backdoor baselines suffer severe effectiveness degradation under safety filtering, whereas DGBA consistently achieves high attack success on both PPO and TRPO victims.\nThese findings indicate that security evaluations of RL systems must account for real-world perception and control constraints.\nReferences\nR.

    "preview_text": "Backdoor attacks embed hidden malicious behaviors in reinforcement learning (RL) policies and activate them using triggers at test time. Most existing attacks are validated only in simulation, while their effectiveness in real-world robotic systems remains unclear. In physical deployment, safety-constrained control pipelines such as velocity limiting, action smoothing, and collision avoidance suppress abnormal actions, causing strong attenuation of conventional backdoor attacks. We study this previously overlooked problem and propose a diffusion-guided backdoor attack framework (DGBA) for real-world RL. We design small printable visual patch triggers placed on the floor and generate them using a conditional diffusion model that produces diverse patch appearances under real-world visual variations. We treat the robot control stack as a black-box system. We further introduce an advantage-based poisoning strategy that injects triggers only at decision-critical training states. We evaluate our method on a TurtleBot3 mobile robot and demonstrate reliable activation of targeted attacks while preserving normal task performance.

            "answer": "## 论文核心分析\n\n### **一、 论文旨在解决的核心问题**\n论文指出了一个在强化学习安全领域被长期忽视的关键问题：**传统RL后门攻击在现实世界机器人部署中会因安全约束控制栈而失效**。\n\n- **具体问题**：在仿真环境中设计的RL后门攻击，其恶意行为（如突然转向、冲向障碍物）依赖于策略直接输出控制指令。然而，在现实机器人（如TurtleBot3）中，策略输出的指令会经过一个**安全约束控制栈**的处理，该栈强制执行速度限制、动作平滑和碰撞避免。这个安全层会“过滤”或“抑制”异常的、不安全的指令，导致攻击效果被严重削弱或完全消除。论文将这种现象称为 **“衰减”**。\n- **研究空白**：现有RL后门攻击研究（如TrojDRL, BadRL, SleeperNets）几乎全部在仿真环境（如Atari）中进行评估，其有效性在真实的、带安全约束的机器人系统中未经检验。\n\n### **二、 论文的核心创新点**\n论文提出了一个名为 **“扩散引导的后门攻击框架”** ，旨在克服上述“衰减”问题，实现**在现实世界、带安全约束的机器人系统中依然有效的后门攻击**。其创新是一个系统性框架，包含以下四个相互关联的核心技术创新：\n\n1.  **感知层触发与扩散模型引导的物理补丁生成**\n    - **创新**：将攻击从“动作空间”转移到“感知空间”。不再试图输出会被安全栈过滤的异常动作，而是使用**一个放置在地面上的、可打印的视觉补丁**作为触发器。\n    - **方法**：利用**条件扩散模型**来生成这个补丁。该模型学习在给定当前视觉观察下，能够有效触发目标行为的补丁外观的**分布**，而非一个固定图案。\n    - **价值**：这使得触发器能够适应现实世界中光照、视角、背景纹理的变化，生成多样化的有效补丁外观，从而在不可控的物理视觉条件下实现**可靠激活**。\n\n2.  **基于优势的稀疏毒化策略**\n    - **创新**：在训练阶段，并非对所有状态进行毒化，而是**只选择对策略更新影响最大的“决策关键状态”** 注入触发器。\n    - **方法**：利用PPO算法中的优势函数 `A_t` 的绝对值来量化状态的重要性。仅对优势值最高的前 `K` 个（如5%）状态进行毒化。\n    - **价值**：在极低的毒化预算下（仅修改少量训练数据），高效地将后门行为植入策略，同时**最大程度地保持了策略在干净任务上的原始性能**。\n\n3.  **面向黑盒安全控制栈的攻击目标定义**\n    - **创新**：明确承认并建模安全控制栈 `𝒞(·)` 为**黑盒系统**（攻击者无法访问或修改它）。\n    - **方法**：将攻击成功的目标定义为**经过安全栈过滤后的最终执行动作** `ã_t = 𝒞(π_θ(õ_t))`，而非策略的原始输出 `a_t`。训练时的损失函数直接优化这个最终执行动作与目标动作的匹配度。\n    - **价值**：这使得整个攻击框架（包括扩散模型生成和毒化训练）被隐式地引导去生成能够“穿透”或“绕过”安全过滤器的触发器，从而直接对抗“衰减”效应。\n\n4.  **物理风格的数据增强**\n    - **创新**：在训练阶段对扩散模型生成的补丁应用一系列模拟真实世界成像效果的增强。\n    - **方法**：包括随机缩放、透视扭曲（模拟不同视角）、亮度/对比度抖动、颜色扰动和部分遮挡。\n    - **价值**：进一步缩小仿真与现实的差距，提高生成的补丁对真实相机几何、光照条件和环境杂波的**鲁棒性**，确保打印出来的补丁在物理世界中依然有效。\n\n### **三、 解决方案的整体框架**\n论文的解决方案（DGBA）是一个端到端的训练与部署流程：\n1.  **训练干净策略**：首先在仿真中训练一个性能良好的基础导航策略。\n2.  **后门微调**：\n    - 收集策略 rollout，计算优势值。\n    - 选择优势值高的关键状态。\n    - 在这些状态上，用扩散模型生成并经过物理增强的补丁覆盖原始图像。\n    - 以**最终执行的目标动作**为监督信号，更新策略参数，同时用标准PPO目标更新干净状态。\n3.  **现实世界部署**：\n    - 从训练好的扩散模型中采样一个补丁图案，打印出来并放置在地面上。\n    - 将微调后的策略部署到真实机器人上。\n    - 当机器人摄像头看到该补丁时，策略会输出指令，经安全栈过滤后，**机器人仍会执行攻击者预设的恶意行为**（如右转、左转、直行撞障碍物或停止）。\n\n### **四、 实际价值与意义**\n- **安全警示**：该研究首次系统地揭示了RL系统从仿真迁移到现实世界时可能引入的**新型安全漏洞**。传统的安全评估（仅在仿真中进行）严重不足，安全约束控制器并不能完全防御精心设计的感知层后门攻击。\n- **攻击范式**：为针对现实世界Cyber-Physical Systems（CPS）和机器人的后门攻击提供了一个强大且实用的新范式，强调了**跨仿真与现实鸿沟进行安全评估的必要性**。\n- **基准与方法**：在广泛使用的TurtleBot3平台上进行了详实的实验，为后续研究设立了新的基准。其提出的扩散引导、优势毒化、黑盒目标定义等方法，对防御方案的设计也具有重要的启发意义。\n\n**总结**：这篇论文的核心贡献在于**首次提出并验证了一种能够有效对抗现实世界机器人安全约束控制栈的RL后门攻击方法**。它通过将触发机制置于感知层、利用生成模型适应物理变化、并针对最终执行效果进行优化，成功解决了传统攻击在物理部署中“衰减”的难题，对RL的安全研究和实践部署敲响了警钟。",

            "answer": "## 论文《Diffusion-Guided Backdoor Attacks in Real-World Reinforcement Learning》发展脉络梳理\n\n本文针对**现实世界强化学习（RL）中的后门攻击**问题，提出了一个创新框架（DGBA）。要理解其贡献，需要梳理该方向从纯仿真环境到现实物理部署的发展脉络。其演进主要围绕**攻击有效性、隐蔽性、效率**以及**应对现实世界约束**这几个核心方向展开。\n\n以下是该领域的关键发展步骤及其改进：\n\n### 1. 奠基与概念验证：仿真环境中的后门攻击\n*   **代表工作：TrojDRL (Kiourti et al., 2019)**\n*   **核心改进：** 首次系统性地将后门攻击概念引入深度强化学习领域。它通过在训练数据中插入带有**特定触发器（如图像中的小图案）** 的样本并修改对应奖励信号，使智能体学习到“平时正常，触发时作恶”的隐藏策略。\n*   **局限性：** 攻击在**理想化的仿真环境**（如Atari游戏）中验证，假设策略输出动作被环境直接执行。未考虑现实部署中必然存在的**安全约束控制栈**（如速度限制、碰撞避免）对恶意动作的过滤（即“衰减”效应）。\n\n### 2. 提升攻击效率与隐蔽性：稀疏化与关键状态攻击\n*   **代表工作：BadRL (Cui et al., 2024)**\n*   **核心改进：** 认识到并非所有训练状态对策略更新的影响都相同。提出**仅对决策关键状态进行毒化**，用更少的毒化样本（更低的投毒预算）实现高攻击成功率。这提升了攻击的隐蔽性和数据效率。\n*   **局限性：** 尽管效率提升，但**仍在仿真环境中进行评估**。其使用的数字触发器在现实世界的视觉变化（光照、视角、遮挡）下可能失效，且未考虑安全控制栈的衰减效应。\n\n### 3. 跨算法与表示层攻击：通用性提升\n*   **代表工作：SleeperNets (Rathbun et al., 2024)**\n*   **核心改进：** 将后门攻击构建为一个**外层优化问题**，在训练轨迹完成后选择关键状态和奖励进行毒化。这种方法旨在实现**跨不同RL算法**的通用后门攻击，并尝试在策略的**表示层面**植入后门，可能更具隐蔽性。\n*   **局限性：** 核心评估环境**仍是仿真**。论文发现，在现实部署中，这类方法对视觉变化和控制过滤非常敏感，攻击成功率大幅下降（在本文实验中ASR最低）。\n\n### 4. 应对现实世界挑战：从仿真到物理部署的跨越\n*   **本文工作：DGBA (Diffusion-Guided Backdoor Attacks)**\n*   **核心改进与创新方向：** 本文首次明确指出并系统性地解决了现实世界RL部署中安全约束导致的**“衰减”问题**，将研究背景从纯仿真推向物理机器人系统。其改进是**多维度、系统性**的：\n    1.  **攻击媒介创新（感知层 vs. 控制层）：** 此前工作多直接毒化状态-动作对或奖励。DGBA采用**可打印的物理视觉补丁**作为触发器，作用于**感知层**，从而绕过直接在控制输出层与安全过滤器“对抗”的难题。\n    2.  **触发器鲁棒性创新：** 针对现实世界视觉变化，首次引入**条件扩散模型**来生成触发器。它不是学习一个固定图案，而是学习一个**补丁外观的分布**，从而在多样的光照、视角、背景下都能可靠激活后门。\n    3.  **训练策略增强：** 继承了BadRL的“关键状态毒化”思想，但将其与**优势函数（Advantage）** 结合，在PPO等算法中更精准地定位对策略更新影响最大的时刻进行毒化，进一步提升效率。\n    4.  **对现实约束的建模：** 明确将机器人**安全控制栈视为黑盒**，在攻击优化目标中直接以**经过安全过滤后的执行动作**作为对齐目标，迫使后门学习去生成那些即使经过过滤仍能导致目标行为的策略。\n    5.  **仿真到现实的桥梁：** 引入了**物理风格的数据增强**（随机缩放、透视扭曲、亮度对比度抖动等），使在仿真中训练的扩散模型和策略能更好地泛化到真实物理世界。\n\n### 发展脉络总结与核心方向\n整个发展脉络清晰地呈现出从**理论验证** -> **效率优化** -> **现实迁移**的演进路径。\n\n着重于以下几个不同的发展方向：\n1.  **攻击有效性的场景迁移：** 从**无约束的仿真环境** 发展到 **受安全约束的现实物理系统**。这是本文最核心的贡献，开辟了后门安全研究的新战场。\n2.  **攻击效率与隐蔽性的提升：** 从**全量/随机毒化** 发展到 **基于关键状态的稀疏毒化**。在有限的投毒权限下最大化攻击影响。\n3.  **触发器设计的演进：** 从**数字域、固定的触发器** 发展到 **物理域、多样化的触发器**。利用生成式AI（扩散模型）解决现实世界感知的不确定性。\n4.  **攻击目标的明确化：** 从追求**策略输出层的恶意动作** 转变为追求 **最终执行层的恶意行为**。承认并绕过安全中间件，使攻击定义更贴合实际威胁模型。\n\n**实际价值与启示：**\n本文表明，在仿真中有效的后门攻击在现实系统中可能因安全机制而失效，但这**不意味着系统安全**。攻击者会相应地将攻击链前移至感知层，并采用更鲁棒的技术。这要求RL系统的安全评估必须**从仿真扩展到真实部署，并涵盖感知、决策、控制全链路**。DGBA为理解和防御现实世界的RL后门攻击提供了一个重要的基准和新的思路。",

            "answer": "好的，作为一名专业的学术论文分析助手，我将对这篇题为《Diffusion-Guided Backdoor Attacks in Real-World Reinforcement Learning》的论文进行深入分析，并详细阐述其提出的关键技术方法。\n\n## 论文核心问题与技术创新\n\n**核心问题**：现有强化学习后门攻击研究大多在仿真环境中进行，其假设策略输出可直接作用于环境。然而，在**现实世界机器人部署**中，策略产生的控制命令会经过一个**安全约束控制栈**（如速度限制、动作平滑、碰撞避免）的过滤和修正。这种过滤会抑制异常或危险的动作，导致传统后门攻击的恶意行为被大幅削弱甚至消除，作者称此现象为**“衰减”**。\n\n**技术创新**：为解决“衰减”问题，论文提出了一个**扩散引导的后门攻击框架**。其核心思想是**在感知层面植入后门**，而非直接操纵控制动作。通过生成一个在真实世界视觉变化下仍能可靠触发的物理视觉触发器，并优化策略，使其在触发后输出的动作在经过安全控制栈过滤后，仍能产生攻击者期望的“执行后行为”。\n\n## 关键技术方法详述\n\n以下表格详细说明了DGBA框架中的关键技术组件及其细节：\n\n| 方法组件 | 技术目标 | 具体技术细节与数学原理 | 关键参数与实现 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **1. 物理地板补丁触发器** | 构建一个可在现实世界部署、可打印的物理触发器，最小化对场景的干扰。 | - **触发器函数**：给定原始视觉观测 \\(x_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{H \\times W \\times C}\\) 和一个定义补丁区域的二值掩码 \\(M \\in \\{0,1\\}^{H \\times W}\\)，触发后的图像 \\(\\tilde{x}_t\\) 通过像素级混合生成： <br> \\(\\tilde{x}_t = (1 - M) \\odot x_t + M \\odot p_t\\) <br> 其中 \\(p_t\\) 是补丁图案，\\(\\odot\\) 表示逐元素相乘。 <br> - 触发后的策略输入为 \\(\\tilde{o}_t = (\\tilde{x}_t, s_t)\\)，其中 \\(s_t\\) 为不可控的辅助传感器读数（如激光雷达）。 | - **补丁尺寸**：在策略输入分辨率（84x84）下，补丁区域为 \\(16 \\times 16\\) 像素，位于图像下部（对应地板区域）。 <br> - **部署尺寸**：补丁上采样为 \\(128 \\times 128\\) 的RGB图像进行打印。 <br> - **掩码M**：固定位置和大小的二值矩阵。 |\n| **2. 条件扩散补丁生成器** | 生成一个**补丁外观的分布**，而非单一固定图案，以应对真实世界中不可控的视觉变化（如视角、光照、背景纹理）和辅助状态 \\(s_t\\) 的差异，确保触发可靠性。 | - **采用去噪扩散概率模型**。前向过程逐步添加高斯噪声： <br> \\(q(p_k \\mid p_0) = \\mathcal{N}(p_k; \\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_k} p_0, (1-\\bar{\\alpha}_k)I)\\) <br> 其中 \\(p_0\\) 是干净补丁，\\(k\\) 是扩散步数，\\(\\bar{\\alpha}_k = \\prod_{i=1}^{k} \\alpha_i\\) 是噪声调度表的累积乘积。 <br> - **反向去噪过程**由一个神经网络 \\(\\epsilon_\\psi\\) 学习，该网络以带噪补丁 \\(p_k\\)、当前视觉观测 \\(x_t\\) 和步数 \\(k\\) 为条件，预测注入的噪声 \\(\\epsilon\\)。训练目标为标准噪声预测损失： <br> \\(\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{diff}}(\\psi) = \\mathbb{E}_{k, p_0, \\epsilon} \\| \\epsilon - \\epsilon_\\psi(p_k, x_t, k) \\|^2\\) <br> - **在训练中**，带噪补丁通过重参数化技巧得到： \\(p_k = \\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_k} p_0 + \\sqrt{1-\\bar{\\alpha}_k} \\epsilon\\)。 <br> - **在微调中**，后门植入的目标是优化： <br> \\(\\mathbb{E}_{p_k \\sim p_\\psi(p \\mid x_t)} [ \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{tar}}(\\theta; p_k) ]\\) <br> 这使得策略学习将**一组补丁外观**与目标行为关联。 | - **网络结构**：条件U-Net。 <br> - **输入条件**：当前观测图像 \\(x_t\\) 和扩散步数 \\(k\\)。 <br> - **输出**：\\(16 \\times 16\\) 的补丁图案。 <br> - **关键思想**：扩散模型会为那些在**经过黑盒控制栈 \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) 执行后**仍能**一致**引发目标行为的补丁外观 \\(p_t\\) 分配更高的概率，从而隐式地克服了“衰减”。 |\n| **3. 物理风格补丁增强** | 弥补仿真与现实之间的视觉差异（sim-to-real gap），提高补丁在真实物理环境中的鲁棒性。 | - 对扩散采样得到的补丁 \\(p_t\\) 应用增强算子 \\(\\mathcal{A}\\)： <br> \\(p_t^{aug} = \\mathcal{A}(p_t)\\) <br> - \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) 模拟真实世界的图像形成过程，包括： <br> 1. **几何变换**：随机缩放（模拟距离变化）、透视扭曲（模拟视角变化）、平面内旋转（模拟贴片未对齐）。 <br> 2. **光度变换**：亮度和对比度抖动（模拟光照变化）、颜色扰动（模拟传感器差异）。 <br> 3. **部分遮挡**：模拟污渍、磨损或环境杂物。 | - **增强类型**：组合使用上述几何与光度变换。 <br> - **目的**：强制模型对这些扰动具有不变性，增加真实打印补丁被一致识别为触发器的概率。 |\n| **4. 基于优势的毒化策略** | 在有限的毒化预算（仅能修改少量训练数据）下，最大化后门植入的效率。 | - **核心**：仅毒化对策略更新影响最大的“决策关键状态”。 <br> - **选择标准**：使用PPO算法中计算的**优势函数绝对值** \\(|A_t|\\)。优势函数 \\(A_t = \\hat{R}_t - V_\\phi(o_t)\\) 衡量在状态 \\(o_t\\) 采取某个动作相对于平均水平的优劣。\\(|A_t|\\) 越大，该状态-动作对策略更新的影响越大。 <br> - **选择过程**：在每个训练回合中，对所有时间步 \\(t\\) 的 \\(|A_t|\\) 进行排序，仅选择排名前 \\(K\\) 的步骤进行毒化。 \\(K = \\lfloor \\beta H \\rfloor\\)，其中 \\(H\\) 是回合长度，\\(\\beta\\) 是毒化比率。 | - **关键参数**：毒化比率 \\(\\beta\\)。论文中主要设置为 **5%**（即仅毒化 top 5% 的关键状态）。 <br> - **效果**：将毒化样本集中在高杠杆的学习信号上，在保持正常任务性能的同时，高效地植入后门。 |\n| **5. 黑盒安全约束控制栈处理** | 在不知道、也无法修改安全控制器 \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) 内部逻辑的情况下，设计能抵抗其“衰减”效应的攻击。 | - **核心假设**：将控制栈 \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) 视为一个**黑盒系统**，攻击者无法对其求导或建模。 <br> - **攻击目标重新定义**：攻击成功与否，不是看策略输出的原始动作 \\(a_t\\)，而是看经过控制器处理后的**实际执行动作** \\(\\tilde{a}_t\\)： <br> \\(\\tilde{a}_t = \\mathcal{C}(\\pi_\\theta(\\tilde{o}_t))\\) <br> - **毒化损失函数**：因此，毒化时的目标损失函数是基于执行动作定义的： <br> \\(\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{tar}}(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}_{t \\in \\mathcal{I}} [ \\ell(\\tilde{a}_t, a_t^{\\text{target}}) ]\\) <br> 其中 \\(\\ell\\) 是距离度量（如MSE），\\(\\mathcal{I}\\) 是被毒化的时间步集合。 | - **无需**对 \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) 进行显式建模或可微近似。 <br> - **训练过程**：在仿真中，通过调用与真实控制器行为近似的安全模块来计算 \\(\\tilde{a}_t\\)，并以此计算 \\(\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{tar}}\\) 来更新策略。这使得扩散模型和策略的优化过程都**隐式地**学会了生成能绕过或适应安全过滤的触发器和策略。 |\n| **6. 统一训练与部署流程** | 将上述组件整合为一个可操作的端到端攻击流程。 | **阶段1（清洁预训练）**：在仿真中训练一个正常的PPO策略 \\(\\pi_{\\theta_0}\\)，获得良好的",

            "question": "论文的主要局限性有哪些？未来可能的改进方向是什么？",
            "answer": "## 论文主要局限性分析\n\n基于对论文内容的分析，本文提出的扩散引导后门攻击（DGBA）方法虽然在实际机器人系统中表现出色，但仍存在以下主要局限性：\n\n### 1. **攻击场景与任务相对受限**\n   - **环境与任务单一性**：实验仅在**室内静态环境**中进行，使用TurtleBot3完成**点对点导航避障**任务。未验证在动态环境、复杂交互任务（如机械臂操作）或多智能体场景下的有效性。\n   - **触发形式固定**：触发器为**地面打印斑块**，依赖于机器人摄像头对地面的观测。对于非地面机器人（如无人机、机械臂）或非视觉主导的任务，该触发方式可能不适用。\n\n### 2. **对安全控制栈的假设较为理想化**\n   - **“黑盒”但已知存在**：论文将安全控制栈视为黑盒，但**假设其始终存在且功能已知**（如速度限制、平滑滤波）。在实际中，控制栈的实现可能更加复杂或包含不可预测的紧急干预机制，可能进一步削弱攻击效果。\n   - **未考虑自适应或学习型安全控制器**：现代机器人可能采用基于学习的自适应安全过滤器，其行为可能更难以预测和绕过，本文未对此类场景进行测试。\n\n### 3. **攻击依赖严格的训练条件与权限**\n   - **需要污染训练数据的能力**：攻击属于**训练时投毒**，要求攻击者能够访问并修改部分训练数据流。在实际部署中，如果训练流程是封闭或受严格监控的，这种访问权限可能难以获得。\n   - **需要仿真到实物的训练管道**：DGBA依赖于先在仿真中训练干净策略，再进行后门微调。如果策略是完全在真实世界中在线学习的，该方法可能不直接适用。\n\n### 4. **物理实现的潜在挑战**\n   - **斑块放置的实操性**：攻击成功依赖于将打印斑块**精确放置**在机器人路径上的关键决策点。在现实世界中，这可能受到环境管理、人员干预或监控的限制。\n   - **环境变化的极端情况**：尽管使用了扩散模型和物理增强，但**极端光照（如强反光、黑暗）、严重遮挡、或斑块严重磨损**等情况仍可能影响触发的可靠性。\n\n### 5. **评估维度不够全面**\n   - **隐蔽性评估不足**：论文主要评估了攻击成功率（ASR）和清洁任务成功率（CSR），但未深入分析后门策略的**隐蔽性**（例如，其激活触发器的行为模式是否容易被异常检测系统发现）。\n   - **长期与多任务影响未知**：实验在单次、短时任务中进行。后门在**长期运行**或**多任务切换**中是否会导致策略不稳定或性能漂移，尚未验证。\n\n---\n\n## 未来可能的改进方向\n\n针对上述局限性，未来的研究可以从以下几个方向进行改进：\n\n### 1. **扩展攻击场景与泛化能力**\n   - **开发更通用的触发机制**：研究不依赖于特定传感器（如摄像头）或场景（如地面）的触发器，例如**声学触发、电磁干扰或对本体感知信号的轻微扰动**。\n   - **探索动态环境与复杂任务**：在动态障碍物、人机共存环境以及更复杂的操作任务中验证和增强攻击方法的鲁棒性。\n\n### 2. **提升对复杂安全机制的绕过能力**\n   - **针对自适应安全控制器的攻击**：研究如何对抗基于强化学习或神经网络的安全过滤器，可能需要在攻击优化中**显式地对安全控制器的行为进行建模或对抗性适应**。\n   - **探索测试时攻击**：在无法接触训练过程的情况下，研究如何通过**测试时的输入扰动（对抗性示例）** 来激活恶意行为，降低攻击门槛。\n\n### 3. **增强攻击的隐蔽性与鲁棒性**\n   - **优化触发器的隐蔽性**：设计**更自然、不易察觉的触发器**（如融入环境的纹理、特定形状的日常物体），并评估其对抗人工审查和自动异常检测的能力。\n   - **提高对极端物理条件的鲁棒性**：在扩散模型训练中引入**更广泛和更极端的物理增强**，模拟各种恶劣条件，使生成的触发器分布覆盖更广的真实世界变异。\n\n### 4. **发展更全面的评估框架与防御手段**\n   - **建立多维度的安全基准测试**：为真实世界RL系统设计包含**隐蔽性、长期稳定性、多任务一致性**等维度的安全评估基准。\n   - **探索针对性的防御方法**：本文揭示了传统仿真后门攻击的“衰减”现象，这本身为防御提供了思路。未来可研究：\n     - **利用安全控制栈作为主动防御层**的增强方法。\n     - **针对物理触发器的检测技术**（如场景异常分析）。\n     - **对训练数据中潜在物理触发模式的鲁棒学习算法**。\n\n### 5. **深入理论分析**\n   - **理论解释衰减现象**：对安全控制栈引起的后门“衰减”效应进行更形式化的**理论建模与分析**，量化不同控制约束对各类后门攻击的抑制能力。\n   - **分析攻击的可转移性**：深入研究DGBA生成的触发器在不同策略架构、不同机器人平台之间的**可转移性**，这对于评估攻击的实际威胁范围至关重要。\n\n**总结**：本文开创性地研究了安全约束下真实世界RL的后门攻击，指出了现有仿真攻击的不足，并提出了有效的解决方案。未来的工作应在**泛化性、隐蔽性、对抗更复杂安全机制**等方面深入探索，同时以此为契机，推动建立更坚实的真实世界RL系统安全评估与防御体系。",
