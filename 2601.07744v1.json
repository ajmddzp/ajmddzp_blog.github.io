Specifically, only a subset of agents is instrumented with onboard seekers (informed/seeker-equipped agents), whereas the rest of them (seeker-less agents) acquire the information about the target indirectly via the informed agents and execute a distributed cooperative guidance for simultaneous target interception. To address the resulting partial observability, a predefined-time distributed observer is leveraged, guaranteeing convergence of the target state estimates for seeker-less agents through information exchange with seeker-equipped neighbors over a directed communication graph. Thereafter, an improved time-to-go estimate accounting for wide launch envelopes is utilized to design the distributed cooperative guidance commands. This estimate is coupled with a predefined-time consensus protocol, ensuring consensus in the agents’ time-to-go values. The temporal upper bounds within which both observer error and time-to-go consensus error converge to zero can be prescribed as design parameters. Furthermore, the cooperative guidance commands are realized by means of an autopilot, wherein the interceptor is steered by canard actuation. The corresponding fin deflection commands are generated using a predefined-time convergent sliding mode control law. This enables the autopilot to precisely track the commanded lateral acceleration within a design-specified time, while maintaining non-singularity of the overall design. Theoretical guarantees are supported by numerical simulations across diverse engagement geometries, verifying the estimation accuracy, the cooperative interception performance, and the autopilot response using the proposed scheme.\nKeywords\n— Cooperative estimation-guidance-control, predefined-time convergence, impact time, salvo guidance.\n1\nIntroduction\nThe primary objective of modern guidance systems is to achieve precise target interception while satisfying stringent terminal requirements such as prescribed impact time\n[\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n]\n, and impact angle\n[\n4\n,\n5\n,\n6\n]\n. Although single-interceptor engagements have been extensively investigated, their practical effectiveness is often compromised by inherent limitations, including restricted seeker field-of-view, actuator saturation, and system lags. At the same time, advanced defense architectures employ layered protection and countermeasures such as close-in weapon systems, making penetration by a lone attacker highly improbable. These challenges highlight the need for coordinated multi-interceptor engagements, commonly referred to as salvo guidance, to address the limitations of traditional one-to-one interception.\nContemporary salvo strategies are broadly categorized into non-cooperative and cooperative approaches. Non-cooperative schemes rely on preassigned impact times without information exchange, making them susceptible to errors during flight and reducing the likelihood of simultaneous interception. Cooperative schemes, in contrast, exploit real-time information sharing and coordination among interceptors, enabling superior synchronization and robustness against uncertainties. For instance, the work in\n[\n7\n]\nintroduced a distributed cooperative guidance law based on biased proportional navigation (PN). Building on this, the authors of\n[\n8\n]\nreformulated impact-time control as a range-tracking problem. The work in\n[\n9\n]\naimed to minimize time-to-go variance by varying navigation gains, but relied on all-to-all communication. This approach was extended in\n[\n10\n]\nunder acceleration constraints, and the authors of\n[\n11\n]\nincorporated finite-time consensus with terminal constraints, all considering undirected networks.\nThe work in\n[\n12\n]\nproposed finite-time distributed laws requiring only local time-to-go estimates, reducing communication, whereas in\n[\n13\n]\n, a receding-horizon cooperative guidance law was proposed where interceptors exchanged only neighbor data and solved local finite-horizon optimizations. The work in\n[\n14\n,\n15\n]\navoided explicit time-to-go estimation using a two-stage scheme relying on decentralized consensus on range/heading followed by PN guidance. In\n[\n16\n]\n, coordination with local guidance in both centralized and distributed forms was integrated. Together, the strategies\n[\n14\n,\n15\n,\n16\n,\n12\n,\n13\n]\nensured consensus over undirected networks, though only asymptotically. This could lead to performance degradation in short-duration engagements because strict control over it may be lacking.\nLeader–follower design combined with PN-based time-to-go estimation and super-twisting sliding mode control was proposed in\n[\n17\n]\nto guarantee finite-time convergence even under large heading errors for simultaneous interception of stationary targets. However, it should be taken into consideration that failure of the leader will compromise the mission. The authors in\n[\n18\n]\ndeveloped time-to-go–dependent guidance laws based on the suboptimal finite-time state-dependent Riccati equation (FT-SDRE) for simultaneous target interception; however, the inherent sub-optimality of the FT-SDRE may constrain performance in highly dynamic engagement scenarios. In\n[\n19\n]\n, a cooperative guidance was developed that explicitly addressed lateral acceleration constraints within a nonlinear framework, ensuring stability even under large heading errors, and extended applicability to both directed and undirected networks. However, the consensus over the network is reached only asymptotically. Fixed-time cooperative guidance laws, for example,\n[\n20\n,\n21\n,\n22\n,\n23\n,\n24\n]\n, may address the shortcomings of asymptotic and finite-time schemes used in aforementioned works by guaranteeing consensus independent of initial engagement conditions, thereby ensuring reliable guidance precision. Nevertheless, these methods often rely on conservatively large controller gains, and their design parameters must be re-tuned whenever a different consensus time is desired, which can limit practical flexibility. To overcome this, leaderless cooperative guidance based on predefined-time consensus was proposed by\n[\n25\n]\nfor interceptor swarms, guaranteeing arbitrarily set time-to-go consensus and simultaneous interception under stationary or maneuvering targets with undirected dynamic topologies. The work in\n[\n26\n]\nproposed a leader–follower cooperative salvo guidance law with arbitrary-time consensus ensuring predefined-time agreement on time-to-go and simultaneous interception under nonlinear kinematics and autopilot lag.\nMost of the aforementioned guidance strategies have been developed based solely on the kinematics of interceptor–target engagement, assuming that the interceptor can instantaneously realize any commanded acceleration. This assumption effectively neglects the dynamic characteristics of the interceptor’s control loop, which can lead to significant performance degradation under non-ideal or rapidly changing flight conditions, particularly during the terminal phase of engagement. To address this limitation, it is essential to account for the interceptor’s dynamics while formulating practical guidance strategies to ensure that the proposed guidance law remains effective and implementable in real-world scenarios. In this regard, authors in\n[\n27\n]\nproposed an integrated interceptor guidance–autopilot loop employing a sliding mode control framework to achieve seamless coordination between guidance and flight control for a canard-controlled interceptor. The effectiveness of the integrated design was demonstrated through multiple endgame interception scenarios. Furthermore, the work in\n[\n28\n]\nutilized this decoupled guidance–autopilot design, where canard and tail surfaces were coordinated to track the commanded lateral acceleration using predefined-time convergent sliding mode control. This ensured precise target interception within a specified time, as demonstrated through simulations. Such a framework gives an accurate assessment of real-time performance, including actuator limits, control–guidance coupling, and endgame response characteristics.\nTo the authors’ knowledge, cooperative salvo guidance strategies reported in contemporary literature (for example, the aforementioned works and their cited references) generally assume that all interceptors have access to complete real-time target position information to synchronize their interception times. In practice, however, equipping every interceptor with an onboard seeker is often infeasible in large-scale engagements due to constraints on cost, payload capacity, and energy resources. Moreover, maintaining full bidirectional communication is often impractical due to limited bandwidth, computational load, and onboard power. Therefore, directed interaction topologies, where information flows asymmetrically, provide an effective compromise, ensuring both coordination efficiency and practical feasibility in real-world salvo engagements. In time-critical scenarios with short engagement durations, achieving consensus in the interception time among interceptors within this short duration becomes essential, thereby motivating the use of predefined-time consensus methods that guarantee synchronization within the available window. Similarly, obtaining an instantaneous autopilot response is crucial to the implementation of the cooperative guidance commands, thereby further necessitating accurate control over the tracking error convergence (commanded versus actual input).\nIn this work, we present a new perspective on cooperative simultaneous target interception by developing a one-shot nonlinear cooperative estimation-guidance-control framework to enhance the guidance precision in the endgame. The objective of this joint framework is to simultaneously address the three critical components of the interception problem within a unified design. By embedding the estimator, guidance law, and autopilot into a single coherent architecture, all within predefined-time convergence, the proposed framework explicitly accounts for the performance limitations of contemporary designs, which treat these aspects separately without a clear indication of their mutual interactions, closed-loop stability guarantees, or the resulting impact on terminal accuracy. We summarize our main contributions below.\nIn our treatment, only a subset of interceptors is equipped with seekers, while the remaining agents operate without direct target measurements. These seeker-less interceptors reconstruct the required engagement variables through a predefined-time distributed observer under a heterogeneous sensing architecture that exploits information fusion and local coordination over directed sensing networks.\nThe estimated states are then utilized within a cooperative simultaneous interception scheme that incorporates an improved time-to-go estimate, free from small heading angle assumptions and thus effective under large initial heading angle errors, together with a predefined-time consensus protocol to guarantee simultaneous interception despite heterogeneous target observability. This opens up the full circular range of the interceptors’ bearing angles for interception, thereby providing greater flexibility in realizing a simultaneous interception.\nThereafter, a predefined-time convergent sliding mode control law is developed for generating the interceptor’s canard deflection commands. This guarantees that the autopilot tracks the commanded lateral acceleration or the cooperative guidance commands within a designer-specified settling time, independent of initial conditions. By eliminating lag in the inner-loop dynamics, the proposed scheme ensures that the autopilot does not degrade the overall system response, thereby enabling the interceptor to realize the desired lateral acceleration from the guidance law in an almost instantaneous manner.\nThe proposed one-shot nonlinear cooperative estimation-guidance-control framework eliminates the need for full sensing redundancy, supports decentralized decision making, and ensures strict control on the convergence of necessary variables. It is worth noting that all convergence times (whether associated with estimation error dynamics, consensus error dynamics, or autopilot tracking error) are predefined-time stable, in the sense that the settling time can be explicitly assigned a priori as a design parameter.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.\nSection\n2\nintroduces the preliminaries, including the nonlinear engagement kinematics, interceptor dynamics, and the main objectives.\nSection\n3\ndevelops the proposed one-shot estimation–guidance–control framework in detail.\nSection\n4\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework through various engagement scenarios. Finally,\nSection\n5\nconcludes the paper.\n2\nBackground and Problem Formulation\nFigure 1\n:\nCooperative multi-interceptor engagement\nConsider a multi-interceptor target engagement scenario involving\nN\nN\ninterceptors and a stationary target, as shown in\nFigure\n1\n.

The multi-interceptor swarm is assumed to exchange necessary information over a shared network, which can be modeled via graphs. It should be noted that the multi-interceptor swarm may have different sensing and actuation architectures.\nWe first model the\nsensing topology\nby a directed graph\n𝒮\n=\n{\n𝒱\n,\nℰ\n}\n\\mathscr{S}=\\{\\mathcal{V},\\mathcal{E}\\}\n, where the node set\n𝒱\n=\n{\ns\n0\n,\ns\n1\n,\n…\n,\ns\nN\n}\n\\mathcal{V}=\\{s_{0},s_{1},\\ldots,s_{N}\\}\nconsists of a single target agent\ns\n0\ns_{0}\nand\nN\nN\ninterceptor agents\ns\n1\ns_{1}\nthrough\ns\nN\ns_{N}\n.

The first subproblem involves the design of a predefined-time distributed estimator that reconstructs the target states under heterogeneous sensing constraints. The estimated states are then employed within the guidance subsystem, which computes cooperative acceleration commands by enforcing predefined-time consensus on the estimated time-to-go values across the network. Once these commands are issued, the autopilot subsystem must guarantee sufficiently fast inner-loop dynamics to track these cooperative guidance commands almost instantaneously, thereby realizing predefined-time consensus in the canard deflections and preserving the overall synchronization established at the guidance level.\n3\nCooperative One-Shot Estimation-Guidance-Control Framework\nDesigning cooperative salvo guidance laws requires an accurate estimation of time-to-go, although obtaining an exact value is usually not tractable in most scenarios. As a practical approach, time-to-go is generally approximated using ad-hoc solutions, assuming the interceptors are always confined close to the LOS with the target. For cases with large initial heading angles, this small-angle assumption may not be valid. As shown in\n[\n17\n]\n, a refined estimate for the\ni\ni\nth\ninterceptor’s time-to-go can be given by\nt\ngo\ni\n=\nr\ni\nV\nM\ni\n​\n[\n1\n+\nsin\n2\n⁡\nσ\ni\nk\ni\n]\n,\n\\displaystyle{{t}_{\\mathrm{go}}}_{i}=\\dfrac{r_{i}}{V_{M_{i}}}\\left[1+\\dfrac{\\sin^{2}\\sigma_{i}}{k_{i}}\\right],\n(8)\nwhere\nσ\ni\n=\nγ\nM\ni\n−\nθ\ni\n\\sigma_{i}=\\gamma_{M_{i}}-\\theta_{i}\nis the lead angle,\nk\ni\n=\n4\n​\nN\ni\n−\n2\nk_{i}=4N_{i}-2\n, with\nN\ni\nN_{i}\nbeing a constant greater than 2.\nLemma 5\n.\nThe time-to-go (\n8\n) dynamics for the\ni\ni\nth\ninterceptor exhibits a relative degree of one with respect to its interceptor’s lateral acceleration.\nProof.\nOn differentiating (\n8\n) with respect to time and applying (\n1\n), the expression\nt\n˙\ngo\ni\n=\n−\ncos\n⁡\nσ\ni\n−\nsin\n2\n⁡\nσ\ni\n​\ncos\n⁡\nσ\ni\nk\ni\n+\nsin\n⁡\n2\n​\nσ\ni\n​\nsin\n⁡\nσ\ni\nk\ni\n+\nr\ni\n​\na\nM\ni\n​\nsin\n⁡\n2\n​\nσ\ni\nk\ni\n​\nV\nM\ni\n2\n\\dot{{t}}_{\\mathrm{go}_{i}}=-\\cos\\sigma_{i}-\\frac{\\sin^{2}\\sigma_{i}\\cos\\sigma_{i}}{k_{i}}+\\frac{\\sin 2\\sigma_{i}\\sin\\sigma_{i}}{k_{i}}+\\frac{\\ r_{i}a_{M_{i}}\\sin 2\\sigma_{i}}{k_{i}{V_{M}}_{i}^{2}}\n(9)\nis obtained, showing that the lateral acceleration\na\nM\ni\na_{M_{i}}\nappears in the first derivative of\nt\ngo\ni\nt_{\\mathrm{go}_{i}}\n.\n∎\nIn cooperative simultaneous interception, the guidance command\na\nM\ni\na_{M_{i}}\nfor regulating the engagement duration (by manipulating (\n8\n)) necessitates access to specific engagement variables, such as relative range and lead angles, as evident from\nlemma\n5\n. However, such variables are not always available to all interceptors if a subset of interceptors do not have seekers installed on them. Consistent with\nAssumption\n1\n, seeker-less interceptors must therefore estimate the required engagement parameters before cooperative guidance design is done.\nLet\n𝐩\n=\n[\nx\nT\n,\ny\nT\n]\n⊤\n\\mathbf{p}=[x_{T},\\,y_{T}]^{\\top}\ndenote the target’s position vector in the inertial frame, and\n𝐩\n^\ni\n\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}_{i}\nrepresent the estimate of\n𝐩\n\\mathbf{p}\nas obtained by the\ni\ni\nth\ninterceptor.

Together with the results of\nLemma\n4\n, it is then concluded that the closed-loop (time-to-go) error dynamics is globally predefined-time stable.\nThis essentially means that the time-to-go error for all the interceptors will vanish within the user-selected predefined-time. Thereafter, the interceptors’ time-to-go will be in consensus and decrease. Consequently, the interceptors attain the requisite trajectories leading to simultaneous target interception.\n∎\nRemark 6\n.\nSimilar to\nRemark\n5\n, it can be readily shown that the error-regulating component\n𝐮\n𝐜\n\\mathbf{u_{c}}\nremains uniformly bounded over the interval\n[\n0\n,\nt\ne\n)\n[0,t_{e})\nand once consensus in time-to-go is achieved at\nt\n=\nt\ne\nt=t_{e}\n,\n𝐮\n𝐜\n\\mathbf{u_{c}}\nremains identically zero thereafter.\nAlthough the control law includes the estimated quantities\nr\n^\ni\n\\hat{r}_{i}\nand\nr\n^\ni\n​\nsin\n⁡\n2\n​\nσ\n^\ni\n\\hat{r}_{i}\\sin 2\\hat{\\sigma}_{i}\nin the denominator, these estimates do not remain at zero even if they momentarily approach it, unless their corresponding true values are also zero. Since\nr\ni\n=\n0\nr_{i}=0\nonly at the final interception time, this does not lead to unbounded control requirements. A similar observation applies to the term\nr\n^\ni\n​\nsin\n⁡\n(\n2\n​\nσ\n^\ni\n)\n\\hat{r}_{i}\\sin(2\\hat{\\sigma}_{i})\n, which may suggest a potential loss of control effectiveness at\nσ\n^\ni\n=\n0\n\\hat{\\sigma}_{i}=0\nand\nσ\n^\ni\n=\nπ\n/\n2\n\\hat{\\sigma}_{i}=\\pi/2\n. However, the analysis provided later confirms that the system remains controllable at both points. Prior results in\n[\n4\n]\nfurther indicate that\nσ\n^\ni\n=\nπ\n/\n2\n\\hat{\\sigma}_{i}=\\pi/2\nis not a stable equilibrium and is controllable, whereas\nσ\n^\ni\n=\n0\n\\hat{\\sigma}_{i}=0\ncorresponds to a stable configuration.\nThe observer dynamics, together with the error-regulating control components, drive the above estimates away from zero and prevent them from staying arbitrarily small. As a result, the control input remains well posed throughout the engagement and does not exhibit any blow-up behavior. In fact,\na\nM\ni\na_{M_{i}}\ndecreases smoothly and approaches zero near interception, which will be proved in subsequent analysis.\nWe now examine the behavior of the lead angle after consensus in time-to-go is achieved at\nt\n=\nt\ne\nt=t_{e}\n. Since the observer states converge to their true values at\nt\n=\nt\np\n<\nt\ne\nt=t_{p}<t_{e}\n, the estimated quantities may be treated as the actual variables for the subsequent analysis. From the results of\n[\n17\n,\n33\n]\n, it can be inferred that if\nσ\ni\n​\n(\nt\ne\n)\n≠\n0\n\\sigma_{i}(t_{e})\\neq 0\nthen\nr\ni\n=\n0\n⟹\nσ\ni\n=\n0\nr_{i}=0\\implies\\sigma_{i}=0\nin both 2D and 3D settings.

This essentially means that the lead angle will always decrease after consensus in time-to-go has been established. Moreover, the lead angle becomes small near interception (note\nr\n≠\n0\nr\\neq 0\nyet) due to interceptors all aligned on the collision triangle, and thus, in the endgame, one can write using small-angle assumptions\nσ\n˙\ni\n≊\nV\nM\ni\n​\nσ\ni\n2\n​\nr\ni\n,\nr\n˙\ni\n≊\n−\nV\nM\ni\n.\n\\displaystyle\\dot{\\sigma}_{i}\\approxeq\\frac{V_{M_{i}}{\\sigma_{i}}}{2r_{i}},~~\\dot{r}_{i}\\approxeq-V_{M_{i}}.\n(60)\nThen, it follows from (\n60\n) that\nd\n​\nσ\ni\nd\n​\nr\ni\n=\n−\nσ\ni\n2\n​\nr\ni\n\\dfrac{d\\sigma_{i}}{dr_{i}}=-\\dfrac{\\sigma_{i}}{2r_{i}}\nresults in\nr\ni\n=\nr\ni\n​\n(\nt\ne\n)\n​\n(\nσ\ni\n​\n(\nt\ne\n)\nσ\ni\n)\n2\nr_{i}=r_{i}(t_{e})\\left(\\dfrac{\\sigma_{i}(t_{e})}{\\sigma_{i}}\\right)^{2}\n. Equivalently,\nr\ni\n​\nσ\ni\n2\n=\nr\ni\n​\n(\nt\ne\n)\n​\nσ\ni\n2\n​\n(\nt\ne\n)\n>\n0\nr_{i}\\,\\sigma_{i}^{2}=r_{i}(t_{e})\\,\\sigma_{i}^{2}(t_{e})>0\nfor any initial condition with\nr\ni\n​\n(\nt\ne\n)\n>\n0\nr_{i}(t_{e})>0\nand\nσ\ni\n2\n​\n(\nt\ne\n)\n≠\n0\n\\sigma_{i}^{2}(t_{e})\\neq 0\n. Thus, within the validity of the approximation (\n60\n), the state\nσ\ni\n=\n0\n\\sigma_{i}=0\nis not reachable from any nonzero initial lead angle at a finite positive range because\nr\ni\n​\nσ\ni\n2\nr_{i}\\sigma_{i}^{2}\nis constrained to remain strictly positive. In other words, the reduced endgame dynamics (\n60\n) force the trajectory to evolve along a one-dimensional invariant manifold in the\n(\nr\ni\n,\nσ\ni\n)\n(r_{i},\\sigma_{i})\n-plane, on which the lead angle decreases monotonically but does not reach zero for any\nr\ni\n>\n0\nr_{i}>0\n. Physically, this is consistent with the fact that, after time-to-go consensus, the interceptors remain on (or close to) the collision triangle, so that\nσ\ni\n\\sigma_{i}\nbecomes small as\nr\ni\n→\n0\nr_{i}\\to 0\n, and\nσ\ni\n=\n0\n\\sigma_{i}=0\nprecisely at interception (when\nr\ni\n=\n0\nr_{i}=0\n). The impact state\n(\n0\n,\n0\n)\n(0,0)\nin the\n(\nr\ni\n,\nσ\ni\n)\n(r_{i},\\sigma_{i})\n-plane lies outside the precise regime of the small-angle approximation (\n60\n). Hence, the invariant\nr\ni\n​\nσ\ni\n2\n=\nr_{i}\\sigma_{i}^{2}=\n(constant) is interpreted as describing the asymptotic approach to interception rather than the impact state itself.\nThese inferences also confirm the non-singularity of the proposed command (\n56\n) since\nσ\ni\n≠\n0\n\\sigma_{i}\\neq 0\nunless\nr\ni\n=\n0\nr_{i}=0\nprovided the initial lead angles are non-zero. For the case of full target information if in case\nσ\ni\n​\n(\n0\n)\n=\n0\n\\sigma_{i}(0)=0\n, then the\ni\ni\nth\ninterceptor can only take a straight line trajectory if the time-to-go agreement is such that all other interceptors also align on a similar trajectory. In such a scenario, no maneuver is needed, and\na\nM\ni\na_{M_{i}}\nis identically zero. Excluding this pathological case, non-singularity of (\n56\n), and hence (\n33\n) in\nTheorem\n2\n, is guaranteed.\nUp to this point, the closed-loop, predefined-time, stable estimation–guidance strategy has been rigorously developed. Subsequently, we will design an autopilot with dynamics given in (\n3\n) to ensure that the interceptor’s actual response accurately tracks the commanded lateral acceleration through appropriate canard deflection commands generated by the control system.\nIt is desirable that the interceptor’s autopilot introduce minimal lag, allowing the actual lateral acceleration to closely follow the commanded acceleration from the guidance system almost instantaneously. In other words, the autopilot should enable the interceptor to achieve the desired acceleration response without noticeable delay. Therefore, employing a predefined time is advantageous, as it enables the convergence time to be explicitly prescribed during design while remaining independent of the initial conditions. Such a design is also consistent with our previous development of estimation and guidance frameworks.\nLemma 6\n.\nThe dynamics of\ni\ni\nth\ninterceptor’s achieved lateral acceleration\na\nM\ni\na\n​\nc\na_{M_{i}}^{ac}\nhas a relative degree of one with respect to its canard deflection command.\nProof.\nFrom (\n3a\n), the lateral acceleration for the\ni\ni\nth\ninterceptor is given by\na\nM\ni\na\n​\nc\n=\nL\nα\ni\nβ\n​\nk\n1\ni\n​\n(\nα\ni\n)\n+\nL\nδ\nc\ni\n​\nk\n2\ni\n​\n(\nα\ni\n+\nδ\nc\ni\n)\n,\n\\displaystyle a_{M_{i}}^{ac}=L_{{\\alpha_{i}}}^{\\beta}k_{1_{i}}(\\alpha_{i})+L_{\\delta_{c_{i}}}k_{2_{i}}(\\alpha_{i}+\\delta_{c_{i}}),\n(61)\nwhose time derivative is\na\n˙\nM\ni\na\n​\nc\n=\nL\nα\ni\nβ\n​\nk\n1\ni\n′\n​\n(\nα\ni\n)\n​\nα\n˙\ni\n+\nL\nδ\nc\ni\n​\nk\n2\ni\n′\n​\n(\nα\ni\n+\nδ\nc\ni\n)\n​\n(\nα\n˙\ni\n+\nδ\n˙\nc\ni\n)\n.\n\\displaystyle\\dot{a}_{M_{i}}^{ac}=L_{\\alpha_{i}}^{\\beta}k^{\\prime}_{1_{i}}(\\alpha_{i})\\dot{\\alpha}_{i}+L_{\\delta_{c_{i}}}\\,k^{\\prime}_{2_{i}}(\\alpha_{i}+\\delta_{c_{i}})(\\dot{\\alpha}_{i}+\\dot{\\delta}_{c_{i}}).\n(62)\nOn substituting (\n3a\n) and (\n3d\n) in the above expression, we obtain\na\n˙\nM\ni\na\n​\nc\n=\n[\nL\nα\ni\nβ\n​\nk\n1\ni\n′\n​\n(\nα\ni\n)\n+\nL\nδ\nc\ni\n​\nk\n2\ni\n′\n​\n(\nα\ni\n+\nδ\nc\ni\n)\n]\n​\n(\nq\ni\n−\na\nM\ni\na\n​\nc\nV\ni\n)\n−\nL\nδ\nc\ni\nτ\nc\ni\n​\nk\n2\ni\n′\n​\n(\nα\ni\n+\nδ\nc\ni\n)\n​\nδ\nc\ni\n+\nL\nδ\nc\ni\nτ\nc\ni\n​\nk\n2\ni\n′\n​\n(\nα\ni\n+\nδ\nc\ni\n)\n​\nδ\nc\ni\nc\n,\n\\displaystyle\\dot{a}_{M_{i}}^{ac}=\\left[L_{\\alpha_{i}}^{\\beta}k^{\\prime}_{1_{i}}(\\alpha_{i})+L_{\\delta_{c_{i}}}\\,k^{\\prime}_{2_{i}}(\\alpha_{i}+\\delta_{c_{i}})\\right]\\left(q_{i}-\\dfrac{a_{M_{i}}^{ac}}{V_{i}}\\right)-\\dfrac{L_{\\delta_{c_{i}}}}{\\tau_{c_{i}}}k^{\\prime}_{2_{i}}(\\alpha_{i}+\\delta_{c_{i}})\\delta_{c_{i}}+\\dfrac{L_{\\delta_{c_{i}}}}{\\tau_{c_{i}}}k^{\\prime}_{2_{i}}(\\alpha_{i}+\\delta_{c_{i}})\\delta_{c_{i}}^{c},\n(63)\nindicating that the commanded canard deflection appears in the first derivative of\na\nM\ni\na\n​\nc\n.\na_{M_{i}}^{ac}.\n∎\nFor the\ni\ni\nth\ninterceptor, let us define the tracking error in the lateral acceleration as\ns\ni\n=\na\nM\ni\na\n​\nc\n−\na\nM\ni\n.\n\\displaystyle s_{i}=a_{M_{i}}^{ac}-a_{M_{i}}.\n(64)\nUnder the assumption that the commanded acceleration (which is desired acceleration\na\nM\ni\na_{M_{i}}\n) does not show abrupt changes, it follows that\na\nM\ni\na_{M_{i}}\ncan be regarded as a bounded uncertainty.

Consequently, the proposed canard deflection command remains well-defined.\nFigure 3\n:\nSchematic of the proposed one-shot nonlinear cooperative estimation-guidance-control framework for the\ni\ni\nth\ninterceptor.\nThe overall design schematic for\ni\ni\nth\ninterceptor is illustrated in\nFigure\n3\n. The architecture comprises two interconnected parts. The first part discusses the design of an estimation-guidance scheme, where target states are initially estimated using a predefined-time distributed observer operating over a directed sensing graph. These estimated target states, together with the interceptor’s kinematics, are then employed to estimate the required guidance variables and determine the corresponding time-to-go. The desired interception time is determined cooperatively among the interceptors over a directed actuation graph, and the corresponding error in time-to-go, along with the relevant estimated guidance variables, is used to formulate a corrective control that drives the time-to-go error to zero within the user-specified time. This corrective component, combined with the nominal control input, produces the desired lateral acceleration\na\nM\ni\na_{M_{i}}\nto achieve synchronized interception.\nThe second part addresses the inner control loop. The commanded lateral acceleration\na\nM\ni\na_{M_{i}}\nis not applied instantaneously due to the interceptor’s dynamics and actuator limitations. The autopilot regulates the canard control surfaces to track the desired lateral acceleration\na\nM\ni\na_{M_{i}}\n.

Among them, only\nI\n1\nI_{1}\nis seeker-equipped and can directly measure the target’s position, while the remaining interceptors are seeker-less and rely on information sharing according to the sensing topology\n𝒮\n\\mathscr{S}\nin\nFigure\n4(a)\n, and the actuation graph\n𝒜\n\\mathscr{A}\nis shown in\nFigure\n4(b)\nover which time-to-go information is exchanged. It is worth noting that, while the present case considers identical communication links among interceptors in both the actuation and sensing topologies, the proposed strategy is inherently applicable to dissimilar communication link configurations, which will be demonstrated in subsequent analysis.

The observer and controller gains are selected in accordance with the design criteria established in the preceding analysis. In addition, the predefined observer convergence time is taken as\nt\np\n=\n0.6\n​\ns\nt_{p}=0.6~\\mathrm{s}\n, and the consensus time is set to\nt\ne\n=\n1.6\n​\ns\nt_{e}=1.6~\\mathrm{s}\n. Actuator constraints limit the growth of the time-scaling gain, and in combination with the chosen controller gains, they determine the minimum achievable convergence time. We note that this aspect warrants further study. The parameter\nN\nN\nis fixed at\n3\n3\n.\nFigure\n5\npresents the stationary target engagement scenario, where the interceptors accomplish cooperative simultaneous interception at\n36.51\n​\ns\n36.51~\\mathrm{s}\ndespite having incomplete information. The interceptors are initialized from different starting positions (\nFigure\n5(a)\n), with only\nI\n1\nI_{1}\npossessing direct access to the target’s position. The other interceptors, being seeker-less, estimate the target position in a distributed manner through their interaction with\nI\n1\nI_{1}\nvia the sensing topology\n𝒮\n\\mathscr{S}\n. As shown in\nFigure\n5(b)\nand\nFigure\n5(c)\n, this information asymmetry does not hinder coordination, since the interceptors achieve consensus on a common time-to-go within the prescribed convergence time\nt\ne\n=\n1.6\n​\ns\nt_{e}=1.6~\\mathrm{s}\n, thereby attaining the geometry required for simultaneous interception. The corresponding lateral accelerations and lead angles are illustrated in\nFigure\n5(d)\n. It is evident that, before consensus on time-to-go is reached, the lead angles exhibit fluctuations, and the lateral acceleration demands are relatively large. However, once the observer error converges to zero within the predefined time\nt\np\n=\n0.6\n​\ns\nt_{p}=0.6~\\mathrm{s}\n(\nFigure\n5(e)\n), and consensus on time-to-go is attained at\nt\ne\n=\n1.6\n​\ns\nt_{e}=1.6~\\mathrm{s}\n, both the lead angles and lateral accelerations settle to stable values and approach zero near interception.\nFigure\n6\nillustrates the simultaneous interception of the target by the interceptors at 36.33 s when all the interceptors are equipped with seekers, i.e., full target information is available to all the interceptors. From\nFigure\n6(b)\n, it is evident that the agents achieve consensus in the time-to-go well before\nt\ne\nt_{e}\n. Furthermore,\nFigure\n6(c)\nshows that no noticeable fluctuations are present in the full-information case, whereas the incomplete-information case exhibits initial fluctuations due to the transient behavior of the observer dynamics, and once the observer converges, these fluctuations subside, and the system’s behavior stabilizes.\nIt is worth noting that, even under incomplete information, the achieved interception time is nearly identical to that of the full-information case, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Moreover, since sensing responsibilities are assigned only to a subset of interceptors, i.e., only a few agents are equipped with seekers, the proposed framework offers both resource efficiency and cost effectiveness while maintaining similar performance.\n4.2\nCooperative Salvo using Co-located Interceptors\nTo further assess the effectiveness of the proposed method, the result in\nFigure\n7\nshows a scenario when the engagement geometry is such that the interceptors are co-located at\n(\n7.5\n,\n0.2\n)\n(7.5,0.2)\nkm.

Moreover, the observer errors of all agents converge to zero as presented in\nFigure\n13(e)\n, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework. These results highlight the merits of the proposed framework. Cooperative state estimation remains reliable provided the target maintains a spanning tree in the sensing graph\n𝒮\n\\mathscr{S}\nand the actuation graph\n𝒜\n\\mathscr{A}\nstays strongly connected, even in the presence of seeker and link failures to guarantee a cooperative simultaneous interception.\nIt is worth noting that one of the advantages of the proposed strategy lies in its inherent robustness to the failure of seeker-equipped agents. In contrast to the leader–follower topology proposed in\n[\n34\n]\n, where a single leader interceptor is the only source of target state information and its failure can compromise the entire mission, the proposed framework distributes sensing capability across multiple interceptors. This redundancy ensures that even if one or more seeker-equipped agents fail, the remaining interceptors can still reconstruct the target’s state through cooperative estimation. Consequently, the interception task continues uninterrupted, demonstrating the strategy’s resilience to failures by seeker-equipped agents.\n(a)\nInterceptor’s trajectories.\n(b)\nInterceptors’ time-to-go values.\n(c)\nTrue vs Estimated Time-to-go (left) and Zoomed view (right).\n(d)\nInterceptors’ lateral acceleration and lead angle profiles.\n(e)\nTarget’s state Estimation Error.\nFigure 12\n:\nPerformance evaluation of the proposed method with an increased number of interceptors.\n(a)\nInterceptors’ Trajectories.\n(b)\nInterceptors’ time-to-go values.\n(c)\nTrue vs Estimated Time-to-go (left) and Zoomed view (right).\n(d)\nInterceptors’ lateral acceleration and lead angle profiles.\n(e)\nTarget’s state estimation error.\nFigure 13\n:\nPerformance evaluation of the proposed strategy subjected to seeker and link failures.\n4.4\nAutopilot Performance with Test Inputs\nThe performance of the interceptors’ autopilot for various test inputs is shown in\nFigure\n14\n. The predefined settling time\nt\na\nt_{a}\nis chosen as\n1\n​\ns\n1~\\mathrm{s}\n. In the first case, a square waveform with a time period of 5 s is provided as the commanded input to the autopilot, followed by a cosine waveform of identical period. The proposed autopilot architecture ensures the accurate tracking of both test signals, achieving precise convergence within 0.5 s, i.e., almost instantaneously, thereby confirming the predefined-time convergence capability of the considered controller.\nThe corresponding variations of the states, angle of attack, pitch rate, and control surface deflections for both test inputs are illustrated in\nFigure\n14\n. From\nFigure\n14(e)\nand\nFigure\n14(f)\n, it can be observed that the canard deflections exhibit initial high-frequency oscillations whose amplitude gradually diminishes over time. For the sinusoidal input, these oscillations decay smoothly within\nt\n=\n2.5\n​\ns\nt=2.5~\\mathrm{s}\n, whereas for the square-wave input, the high-frequency components reappear periodically, consistent with the signal’s discontinuities (sudden changes in the value of desired acceleration, in this case\na\nM\nd\na_{M}^{d}\n). These high-frequency transients arise primarily from the rapid corrective action of the autopilot law during the initial response. In addition, part of these oscillations can be attributed to numerical errors introduced by the ODE solver, particularly when integrating fast-varying dynamics.\n(a)\nSquare wave test input.\n(b)\nSinusoidal test input.\n(c)\nAngle of attack and pitch rate (square input).\n(d)\nAngle of attack and pitch rate (sinusoidal input).\n(e)\nCanard deflection (square input)\n(f)\nCanard deflection (sinusoidal input).\nFigure 14\n:\nPerformance of interceptor autopilot for square and sinusoidal test inputs.\n(a)\nInterceptors’ trajectories.\n(b)\nInterceptors’ time-to-go values.\n(c)\nInterceptors’ lateral acceleration and lead angle profiles.\n(d)\nTarget’s state estimation error.\n(e)\nInterceptors’ pitch rate and angle of attack.\n(f)\nInterceptors’ tracking error.\nFigure 15\n:\nPerformance evaluation of the proposed combined estimation–guidance–control architecture.\n(a)\nCanard deflections (\nI\n1\nI_{1}\nand\nI\n2\nI_{2}\n).\n(b)\nCanard deflections (\nI\n3\nI_{3}\nand\nI\n4\nI_{4}\n).\nFigure. 16 (continued).\n4.5\nAutopilot Performance with Actual Commanded Inputs\nThus far, the effectiveness of the proposed estimation–guidance framework has been established. To further substantiate its practical applicability, we now incorporate the autopilot dynamics of the interceptors and evaluate the performance of the complete estimation–guidance–control architecture for the case in which all interceptors are launched from a common initial position. It is assumed that the functions\nk\nm\ni\nk_{m_{i}}\n, for all\nm\n=\n1\n,\n…\n,\n4\nm=1,\\ldots,4\n, are considered as hyperbolic tangent functions with an appropriate boundary layer. The lift and moment coefficients are adopted from\n[\n27\n]\n.\nDue to physical limitations, the maximum canard deflection is constrained to\n20\n∘\n20^{\\circ}\n. The canard actuator time constant is set as\nτ\nc\ni\n=\n0.1\n\\tau_{c_{i}}=0.1\ns for all interceptors. The observer convergence time is predefined as\nt\np\n=\n0.6\n​\ns\nt_{p}=0.6~\\mathrm{s}\n, while the consensus controller is designed to achieve convergence within\nt\ne\n=\n4.5\n​\ns\nt_{e}=4.5~\\mathrm{s}\n. Moreover, the autopilot dynamics are assumed to settle within\nt\na\n=\n2\n​\ns\nt_{a}=2~\\mathrm{s}\n, thereby ensuring coherent operation across all control layers.\nIn this case, the performance of the proposed joint estimation–guidance design is validated, which is illustrated in\nFigure\n15\n. Interceptors are launched from the same location with different initial heading angles, achieving cooperative simultaneous interception at\n36.48\n​\ns\n36.48~\\mathrm{s}\n. The corresponding interceptor trajectories are shown in\nFigure\n15(a)\n, while the evolution of time-to-go estimates reaching consensus within\nt\ne\n=\n2.5\n​\ns\nt_{e}=2.5~\\mathrm{s}\nis depicted in\nFigure\n15(b)\n. The achieved lateral accelerations as a result of canard deflections and corresponding lead angles are presented in\nFigure\n15(c)\n, and observer error convergence to zero within\nt\np\n=\n0.6\n​\ns\nt_{p}=0.6~\\mathrm{s}\nis illustrated in\nFigure\n15(d)\n. The lateral accelerations and lead angles exhibit behavior similar to that observed in previous cases. The corresponding variations of the angle of attack and pitch rate are illustrated in\nFigure\n15(e)\n. The corresponding canard deflections of the interceptors are shown in\nFigure\n16(a)\nand\nFigure\n16(b)\n. It can be observed that the control inputs exhibit initial oscillations, whose amplitude diminishes significantly by approximately\nt\n=\n2\n​\ns\nt=2~\\mathrm{s}\n, which lies well within the user-specified\nt\ne\nt_{e}\n.\nThe effectiveness of the proposed autopilot design is evaluated through a comparative study with the finite-time autopilot reported in\n[\n27\n]\n. It should be noted that the case considered corresponds to worst-case engagement conditions, characterized by large initial heading angle errors and significant uncertainties in the true target position, thereby ensuring a stringent and meaningful validation. Such adverse initial conditions place severe demands on the autopilot performance and robustness, thereby providing a rigorous assessment of its convergence and stability properties. It is well known that, by nature, one of the key advantages of predefined-time control over finite-time control lies in its convergence behavior. In particular, the convergence time of finite-time autopilots depends on the initial conditions and typically requires frequent tuning of controller parameters to achieve the desired performance. However, the proposed one-shot strategy embeds the predefined-time convergence and guarantees convergence of the necessary variables within a user-specified time, irrespective of the initial conditions. Consequently, the autopilot tracks the commanded input accurately, resulting in predictable and reliable tracking behavior. Therefore, to ensure a fair and meaningful comparison, the finite-time autopilot presented in\n[\n27\n]\nis tuned such that its convergence time is set to\nt\na\n=\n2\n​\ns\nt_{a}=2~\\mathrm{s}\n. Moreover, the convergence times corresponding to the estimation and guidance subsystems are maintained identical to those used in the previous case to ensure a consistent comparison.\n(a)\nInterceptors’ trajectories.\n(b)\nInterceptors’ time-to-go values.\n(c)\nInterceptors’ lateral acceleration and lead angle profiles.\n(d)\nTarget’s state estimation error.\n(e)\nInterceptors’ pitch rate and angle of attack.\n(f)\nInterceptors’ tracking error.\nFigure 17\n:\nPerformance comparison of the proposed autopilot with the finite-time autopilot in\n[\n27\n]\n.\n(a)\nCanard deflections (\nI\n1\nI_{1}\nand\nI\n2\nI_{2}\n).\n(b)\nCanard deflections (\nI\n3\nI_{3}\nand\nI\n4\nI_{4}\n).\nFigure 18\n:\nPerformance comparison of the proposed autopilot with the finite-time autopilot in\n[\n27\n]\n(continued).\nFigure\n17\nillustrates the comparison scenario in which all interceptors achieve simultaneous interception at\nt\n=\n36.51\n​\ns\nt=36.51~\\mathrm{s}\n. It should be noted that the interception time is identical to that of the proposed strategy, as the convergence time of the finite-time autopilot is tuned to match the predefined convergence time of the proposed approach. The corresponding interceptors’ trajectories are depicted in\nFigure\n17(a)\n. The evolution of the time-to-go estimates, which reach consensus within\nt\n=\n2.8\n​\ns\nt=2.8~\\mathrm{s}\n, is shown in\nFigure\n17(b)\n. The achieved lateral acceleration commands and lead angle histories are presented in\nFigure\n17(c)\n, exhibiting trends consistent with those observed in the earlier scenarios. The convergence of the observer estimation errors to zero within\nt\np\n=\n0.6\n​\ns\nt_{p}=0.6~\\mathrm{s}\nis illustrated in\nFigure\n17(d)\n. In addition, the time histories of the angle of attack and pitch rate are shown in\nFigure\n17(e)\n, while the corresponding canard deflection profiles for the interceptors are provided in\nFigures\n18(a)\nand\n18(b)\n. With the autopilot convergence time tuned to\nt\na\n=\n2\n​\ns\nt_{a}=2~\\mathrm{s}\n, the canard deflection exhibits a comparable transient response. In particular, the control input shows initial oscillatory behavior, with the oscillation amplitude decaying and settling by approximately\nt\n=\n2.2\n​\ns\nt=2.2~\\mathrm{s}\n, which lies within the convergence time\nt\ne\nt_{e}\n. Furthermore, since the convergence time is enforced uniformly across all control layers, the performance in both approaches appears similar. This further motivates a quantitative assessment for a meaningful comparative evaluation, which may involve comparing the control-effort-based performance metrics.\nTable 1\n:\nComparison of control effort (deg\n2\ns) between the proposed strategy the one in\n[\n27\n]\n.\nInterceptor\nProposed Strategy\nT. Shima\net al.\n[\n27\n]\nJ\n1\nJ_{1}\n54.4090\n64.8340\nJ\n2\nJ_{2}\n54.1757\n61.2017\nJ\n3\nJ_{3}\n75.9851\n94.7799\nJ\n4\nJ_{4}\n54.7839\n67.9214\nJ\n=\n∑\ni\n=\n1\nN\nJ\ni\nJ=\\sum_{i=1}^{N}J_{i}\n239.3537\n288.7370\n(a)\nAbsolute control effort comparison.\n(b)\nPercentage reduction in control effort.\nFigure 19\n:\nComparison of control effort for the proposed strategy and the one in\n[\n27\n]\nThe control effort for each interceptor is evaluated as\nJ\ni\n=\n∫\n0\nt\nf\nδ\nc\ni\n2\n​\n(\nt\n)\n​\n𝑑\nt\nJ_{i}=\\int_{0}^{t_{f}}\\delta_{c_{i}}^{2}(t)\\,dt\n,\nwhere\nt\nf\nt_{f}\ndenotes the interception time. Moreover, we also compare the joint control effort defined as\nJ\n=\n∑\ni\n=\n1\nN\nJ\ni\nJ=\\sum_{i=1}^{N}J_{i}\n,\nwhich offers a more comprehensive and representative measure for evaluating the overall effectiveness.\nThe corresponding individual and joint control effort values are summarized in\nTable\n1\n, while\nFigure\n19(a)\nprovides a clear visual comparison of the control effort across individual interceptors. From\nTable\n1\n, it can be observed that the proposed autopilot achieves approximately a 17% reduction in joint control effort as compared to the finite-time autopilot presented in\n[\n27\n]\n. Furthermore,\nFigure\n19(b)\nillustrates the corresponding percentage reduction in individual interceptor control effort, which is seen to consistently lie within the range of 10 %–20 % across all interceptors. Such a reduction in both individual and joint control effort is particularly advantageous in cooperative engagement scenarios, as it leads to lower actuator utilization, improved energy efficiency, and enhanced robustness of the overall control architecture. This demonstrates that the proposed autopilot is capable of achieving faster and reliable tracking within the predefined time while requiring comparatively smaller control effort in the absence of full state information.\nTherefore, it can be inferred from the extensive simulation studies that, despite the inherent limitation of having only a subset of interceptors equipped with onboard seekers, the proposed one-shot predefined-time estimation–guidance–control architecture achieves performance comparable to strategies reported in the literature that assume continuous availability of full target information even under worst-case engagement conditions, including large initial heading angle errors and significant initial target position estimation errors. This advantage stems from embedding the estimator, guidance law, and autopilot into a single coherent framework with predefined-time convergence, which overcomes the limitations of conventional designs that treat these components independently and often fail to explicitly capture their mutual interactions, closed-loop stability properties, and impact on terminal accuracy. In addition, the observed reduction in both individual and joint control effort reflects improved control efficiency, which directly translates into lower actuator usage, reduced energy consumption, and favorable resource and cost implications. Moreover, the incorporation of a distributed observer enhances operational robustness by enabling simultaneous interception even in the event of seeker failures through inter-agent information sharing. This is unlike many existing strategies in the literature, which rely heavily on continuous access to true target information and consequently fail to guarantee cooperative interception when seeker failures occur. From a practical standpoint, this capability is beneficial in contested or degraded sensing environments such as electronic countermeasure scenarios or partial sensor outages where maintaining cooperative mission success with limited sensing resources is essential.\nTherefore, the proposed one-shot framework is well-suited for resource-constrained cooperative interception applications, such as unmanned aerial vehicle swarms or distributed defense platforms, where limitations in sensing availability, onboard power, and actuator endurance necessitate efficient, robust, and scalable guidance and control solutions. The ability of the proposed framework to maintain cooperative interception performance under these practical constraints highlights its suitability for real-world deployments that demand cost,energy-efficient, resilient, and scalable cooperative guidance and control architectures\n5\nConcluding Remarks\nIn this paper, a unified one-shot nonlinear estimation–guidance–control framework was developed to achieve cooperative simultaneous interception of a stationary target under heterogeneous sensing conditions. By explicitly accommodating a mixed team of seeker-equipped and seeker-less interceptors, the proposed approach addressed the challenges arising from partial observability using a predefined-time distributed observer that guarantees accurate target state reconstruction for uninformed agents through directed information exchange. The improved time-to-go estimation, integrated with a predefined-time consensus protocol, ensures that all interceptors synchronize their impact times within a designer-specified bound, enabling precise cooperative interception even under wide launch envelopes. Furthermore, the canard-based autopilot employing a predefined-time sliding mode control law realizes accurate tracking of the distributed guidance commands while ensuring non-singularity and enforcing strict convergence constraints. Our results across diverse engagement geometries validated the theoretical guarantees, demonstrating high estimation accuracy, coordinated interception performance, and fast autopilot response. Moreover, the distributed and predefined-time convergent design demonstrated robustness to agent failures, communication link failures, and seeker failures, allowing the cooperative interception mission to remain achievable even under degraded sensing or connectivity conditions. Overall, the proposed framework provides a reliable, scalable, and resilient solution for cooperative guidance under heterogeneous sensing conditions.\nReferences\n[1]\nD. Cho, H. J. Kim, and M.-J.

    "preview_text": "This work develops a unified nonlinear estimation-guidance-control framework for cooperative simultaneous interception of a stationary target under a heterogeneous sensing topology, where sensing capabilities are non-uniform across interceptors. Specifically, only a subset of agents is instrumented with onboard seekers (informed/seeker-equipped agents), whereas the rest of them (seeker-less agents) acquire the information about the target indirectly via the informed agents and execute a distributed cooperative guidance for simultaneous target interception. To address the resulting partial observability, a predefined-time distributed observer is leveraged, guaranteeing convergence of the target state estimates for seeker-less agents through information exchange with seeker-equipped neighbors over a directed communication graph. Thereafter, an improved time-to-go estimate accounting for wide launch envelopes is utilized to design the distributed cooperative guidance commands. This estimate is coupled with a predefined-time consensus protocol, ensuring consensus in the agents' time-to-go values. The temporal upper bounds within which both observer error and time-to-go consensus error converge to zero can be prescribed as design parameters. Furthermore, the cooperative guidance commands are realized by means of an autopilot, wherein the interceptor is steered by canard actuation. The corresponding fin deflection commands are generated using a predefined-time convergent sliding mode control law. This enables the autopilot to precisely track the commanded lateral acceleration within a design-specified time, while maintaining non-singularity of the overall design. Theoretical guarantees are supported by numerical simulations across diverse engagement geometries, verifying the estimation accuracy, the cooperative interception performance, and the autopilot response using the proposed scheme.\n\nPredefined-time One-Shot Cooperative Estimation, Guidance, and Control for Simulta",
