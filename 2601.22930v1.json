trajectories\nacross diverse scenarios,\nincluding rare but safety-critical “long-tail” situations\n[\n8\n,\n9\n]\n.\nThese scenarios are underrepresented in training data,\nwhere end-to-end approaches often struggle\ndespite their success in common cases\n[\n10\n]\n.\nTo address this, recent work integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs)\ninto AD pipelines\n[\n11\n,\n34\n,\n38\n]\n,\nleveraging their broad knowledge for better generalization.\nHowever, VLMs still struggle with fine-grained spatial reasoning:\neven state-of-the-art models frequently misjudge ego-vehicle positioning,\nmiss critical obstacles, or miscount lanes\n[\n22\n,\n35\n]\n.\nReinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach\nto improve VLMs for driving tasks\n[\n12\n,\n30\n]\n.\nBeyond the single-turn setting, where the model must succeed on the first attempt,\nRL can be naturally extended to multi-turn interaction:\nthe model proposes a trajectory, receives feedback on potential issues\n(e.g., collision risks or lane violations),\nand iteratively refines the trajectory.\nHowever, directly extending standard algorithms like PPO\n[\n29\n]\nor GRPO\n[\n31\n]\nto multi-turn settings\nintroduces sparse reward challenges:\nrewards are typically assigned only at the final turn,\nleaving intermediate steps without direct supervision.\nAs the number of turns grows,\nthe model must determine which refinements actually contributed to the outcome—\na classic credit assignment problem that makes learning inefficient and unstable.\nMoreover, existing trajectory datasets lack support for multi-turn interactive refinement,\nand there is no established data curation pipeline for multi-turn training scenarios.\nBeyond algorithmic challenges,\ninfrastructure support for multimodal multi-turn RL in autonomous driving remains underdeveloped.\nExisting RL frameworks\n[\n23\n,\n32\n,\n33\n,\n40\n]\nare designed for text-based reasoning tasks,\nlacking optimizations for vision-language driving models—where\nhigh-resolution images and extended multi-turn sequences\ncreate substantial computational and data transfer overhead.\nTo overcome these challenges, we present MTDrive, a comprehensive RL framework\nfor multi-turn trajectory refinement in autonomous driving,\nencompassing data, algorithms, and system infrastructure.\nOur main contributions are summarized as follows:\n•\nInteractive trajectory understanding dataset\n:\nWe curate a multi-turn interactive dataset from a closed-loop driving simulator,\nfiltering scenarios based on key safety metrics\n(collision, drivable area compliance, time-to-collision).\nTrajectory understanding is formulated as a reasoning task,\nwith counterfactual questioning introduced to help the model identify critical obstacles.\nWe also design dedicated SFT data to activate the model’s self-reflection capabilities\nfor iterative trajectory refinement.\n•\nMulti-turn Group Relative Policy Optimization (mtGRPO)\n:\nWe propose mtGRPO, a novel RL algorithm designed to mitigate the sparse reward problem\nin multi-turn environments.\nBuilding upon GRPO, it ensures training stability\nby maintaining token-level advantage consistency within each turn,\nwhile employing turn-level advantages to distinguish contributions across turns.\nThe algorithm also incorporates a progressive reward mechanism\nthat encourages the model to improve its reasoning accuracy as turns increase.\n•\nMultimodal multi-turn RL training system\n:\nWe build a dedicated RL post-training system for vision-language autonomous driving\nbased on the veRL framework\n[\n33\n]\n.\nTo address data transfer bottlenecks caused by large image inputs and multi-turn interactions,\nwe implement targeted optimizations achieving\n2.5\n×\n2.5\\times\nthroughput improvement,\nwhich are also applicable to other multimodal RL tasks.\n•\nComprehensive evaluation on real-world benchmarks\n:\nEvaluated on the NAVSIM benchmark\n[\n3\n]\n, MTDrive achieves a PDMS of 96.2\nwhen using privileged ground-truth perception inputs for planning evaluation,\nand 91.1 under a more realistic setting that relies only on current-frame perception\nwith kinematic modeling for future prediction.\nThis demonstrates the robustness of our multi-turn reasoning framework\nacross different levels of perceptual information availability.\nExtensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework\nin handling complex, long-tail driving scenarios\nthat require iterative trajectory refinement.\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\nVision-Language Models for Autonomous Driving\nVLMs have gained significant traction in AD,\nleveraging cross-modal alignment and zero-shot generalization\nfor high-level decision-making and trajectory prediction.\nExisting VLM-based driving frameworks generally follow two paradigms.\nThe first paradigm utilizes VLMs to generate high-level semantic instructions\nbased on historical trajectories and multi-view images\n[\n34\n,\n35\n]\n.\nThese instructions or latent features then guide a downstream point-to-point planner,\nsuch as a diffusion-based planner or a detection head\n[\n14\n]\n.\nThe second paradigm, which our work follows,\ndirectly employs VLMs to output future driving trajectories\n[\n10\n,\n20\n,\n41\n]\n.\nCompared to the former, this approach is structurally more concise and flexible,\nwhile representing trajectories in natural language\nenhances the model’s task comprehension and provides superior interpretability.\n2.2\nReinforcement Learning in Autonomous Driving\nDevelopments in RL have significantly reshaped\nthe training paradigms of LLMs and VLMs.\nOptimization techniques such as PPO\n[\n29\n]\n,\nREINFORCE-style variants\n[\n1\n]\n,\nand more efficient methods like ReMax\n[\n18\n]\n, REINFORCE++\n[\n7\n]\n, and GRPO\n[\n31\n]\nhave shown remarkable success in aligning large models\nwith human feedback or complex reasoning tasks.\nIn the AD domain, researchers have increasingly integrated RL\nto enhance policy robustness and generalization.\nFor instance, RAD\n[\n5\n]\ntrains agents in photo-realistic 3DGS environments,\nCarPlanner\n[\n39\n]\nlearns an auto-regressive policy for multimodal trajectories,\nand Alpamayo-R1\n[\n25\n]\nemploys RL to enhance reasoning-action consistency in VLAs.\nNotably, recent works like AlphaDrive\n[\n12\n]\n, TrajHF\n[\n16\n]\n,\nand R2SE\n[\n21\n]\nhave introduced GRPO\nto further boost the generalization of driving policies.\n2.3\nInteractive Multi-turn Reasoning in Reinforcement Learning\nMulti-turn interactive reasoning has emerged as a promising direction\nfor enhancing decision-making in complex tasks.\nIn AD,\nDriveAgent-R1\n[\n42\n]\ndemonstrates this potential\nby adaptively switching between linguistic reasoning and tool-assisted inference,\nachieving improvements over state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs.\nFrontier models in general AI (e.g., OpenAI’s o3/o4\n[\n27\n]\n,\nKimi-Researcher\n[\n24\n]\n, and RAGEN\n[\n36\n]\n)\nhave achieved superior intelligence through multi-turn reasoning and iterative refinement.\nHowever, transitioning this capability to AD\npresents challenges in training stability and reward sparsity.\nTo address this, we introduce\nMTDrive\nwith\nmtGRPO\n,\nenabling effective multi-turn policy refinement for autonomous driving.\nFigure 1:\nThe proposed MTDrive framework.\nLeft\n: Multi-turn interaction loop—at each turn\ni\ni\n, the VLM takes front image, ego status, navigation, and historical feedback as input to generate trajectory\nτ\ni\n+\n1\n\\tau_{i+1}\n. The Agent evaluates the trajectory and provides per-metric feedback (e.g., collision, drivable area compliance), which is appended for the next turn.\nRight\n: Actor update with mtGRPO—unlike standard GRPO which uses a single sequence-level reward, mtGRPO computes per-turn rewards\nR\ni\nR_{i}\nand advantages\nA\ni\nA_{i}\nacross multiple rollouts, enabling fine-grained credit assignment for each turn’s contribution.\n3\nMethodology\nIn this section, we propose\nMTDrive\n, as illustrated in Fig.\n1\n,\na comprehensive framework that integrates multi-turn interactive data curation,\na novel RL algorithm (mtGRPO), and an effective multimodal RL training system.\nSection\n3.1\nintroduces the PDM Agent,\nwhich leverages collision-related metrics from the NAVSIM simulator\n[\n3\n]\nto provide interactive feedback for trajectory refinement.\nSection\n3.2\ndescribes the data construction for both SFT and RL stages,\nincluding single-turn, multi-turn, and PDM understanding data.\nSection\n3.3\npresents mtGRPO,\na novel RL algorithm that computes advantages separately for each turn\nto address the sparse reward problem in multi-turn settings.\nSection\n3.4\npresents a multimodal multi-turn RL training system\nbuilt on veRL\n[\n33\n]\n, along with 2 optimization strategies for effective training.\n3.1\nPDM Agent\nOur multi-turn framework is designed to be agent-agnostic—it can integrate with any simulation agent that provides trajectory-level feedback.\nIn this work, we instantiate it with the PDM Agent from the NAVSIM benchmark\n[\n3\n]\n,\nwhich offers standardized metrics and enables direct comparison with existing work.\nThe PDM Agent is developed based on the closed-loop benchmark NAVSIM.\nCentral to this framework is the PDM Score (PDMS),\nintroduced in NAVSIM v1 as the primary metric for assessing driving quality.\nAs formulated in Eq. (\n1\n),\nthe PDMS is a hybrid metric comprising 5 distinct components\nthat strike a balance between safety constraints, driving comfort, and mission progress.\nPDMS\n=\n(\n∏\nm\n∈\n{\nNC, DAC\n}\nScore\nm\n)\n⏟\npenalties\n×\n(\n∑\nw\n∈\n{\nEP, TTC, C\n}\nWeight\nw\n×\nScore\nw\n∑\nw\n∈\n{\nEP, TTC, C\n}\nWeight\nw\n)\n⏟\nweighted average\n\\text{PDMS}=\\underbrace{\\left(\\prod_{m\\in\\{\\text{NC, DAC}\\}}\\text{Score}_{m}\\right)}_{\\text{penalties}}\\times\\underbrace{\\left(\\frac{\\sum_{w\\in\\{\\text{EP, TTC, C}\\}}\\text{Weight}_{w}\\times\\text{Score}_{w}}{\\sum_{w\\in\\{\\text{EP, TTC, C}\\}}\\text{Weight}_{w}}\\right)}_{\\text{weighted average}}\n(1)\nAfter analyzing the distribution of the metrics,\ncollision-related metrics—No Collisions (NC), Time-to-Collision (TTC),\nand Drivable Area Compliance (DAC)—are selected to build the PDM Agent.\nSince the PDM Agent needs to be used in both training and evaluation,\nwe do not include Ego Progress (EP)\nbecause computing EP requires access to ground-truth trajectories.\nThe selected metrics are briefly described below:\n•\nNC\nmeasures whether the autonomous vehicle (AV) collides with other traffic participants or objects.\n•\nDAC\nmeasures whether the AV consistently stays within the designated drivable area.\n•\nTTC\nmeasures whether the AV maintains a sufficient safety margin to other vehicles (typically the lead vehicle) by considering time-to-collision.\nPDM Feedback\nis obtained by summarizing the violated metrics\nidentified by the PDM Agent into textual prompts.\nFor example, with the DAC metric,\ntrajectory points outside the drivable area are extracted and described in text form.\nFor TTC and NC, we similarly extract the coordinates of trajectory points\nthat will result in collisions, as well as the corresponding 3D bounding boxes,\nand present these in textual format.\n3.2\nData Curation\nUnlike traditional multi-turn reasoning SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) in LLMs or VLMs,\npretrained models for autonomous driving tasks exhibit significant limitations\nin both trajectory generation quality and instruction-following ability.\nTherefore, our SFT phase not only serves as a cold start\nto enable multi-turn trajectory generation and PDM feedback understanding,\nbut also ensures sufficient trajectory quality for efficient RL sampling.\nThe SFT training datasets are categorized into three types:\nsingle-turn data, multi-turn data, and PDM understanding data, as illustrated in Fig.\n2\n.\nFigure 2:\nOverview of the SFT Data Generation Pipeline.\nTop-left\n: Single-turn data provides the basic trajectory generation ability which takes front-view image, navigation instruction, historical trajectory (2s), and PDM metric description as input to predict future trajectory (4s).\nTop-right\n: PDM understanding data enables the model to interpret PDM feedback through positive/negative QA pairs.\nBottom\n: Multi-turn data is iteratively bootstrapped from single-turn—train on\ni\ni\n-turn data, run inference, obtain PDM feedback, and stack to form\n(\ni\n+\n1\n)\n(i+1)\n-turn samples, enabling feedback-guided trajectory refinement.\nSingle-turn data.\nInitially, single-turn data is included in the SFT training dataset to enable the model to acquire basic trajectory generation capabilities.\nAs shown on the upper left of Fig.\n2\n, we adopt the trajectory dataset from RecogDrive\n[\n15\n]\n, which is built on NAVSIM.\nThe model receives front-view images, navigation instructions,\n2-second historical trajectory, and PDM metric descriptions,\nthen predicts the 4-second future trajectory.\nMulti-turn data.\nTo activate the model’s multi-turn trajectory reasoning capability,\nwe add multi-turn data to the SFT training dataset.\nAs shown in the second column of Fig.\n2\n,\nthis data is constructed through an iterative bootstrap process.\nStarting from a model trained on last-turn data,\nwe run inference to obtain predicted trajectories, which are then fed to the PDM agent for feedback.\nThe original prompt, model prediction, and PDM feedback are concatenated\nto form the next turn’s input, with the ground-truth trajectory as the target.\nThis process iterates by training on\nk\nk\n-turn data to generate\n(\nk\n+\n1\n)\n(k+1)\n-turn samples.\nSee Appendix\n0.B\nand\n0.A.1\nfor detailed construction steps and examples.\nPDM understanding data.\nTo help the model interpret PDM feedback,\nwe construct question-answering pairs for each PDM metric.\nFor each PDM metric (except Comfort), we design several types of positive and negative samples.\nFor example, regarding the DAC metric,\nthe model is provided with a trajectory point and asked to determine whether it lies within the drivable area, as the examples in the upper right of Fig.\n2\nshow.\nSee Appendix\n0.A.2\nfor detailed examples.\nRL data.\nTo improve training efficiency,\nonly a subset of the NAVSIM training set is used.\nSpecifically, we run evaluations on the training set using the model trained with SFT,\nand categorize the data into three types:\n(1) 2-turn data, where the PDM feedback is not empty after the first inference;\n(2) low-score data, where the PDM score after the first inference\nis below a certain threshold (0.8 in this work);\nand (3) other data.\nTo construct the RL training set, we include all data from categories 1 and 2,\nand randomly sample data from category 3 to balance the distribution.\n3.3\nmtGRPO\nIn RL training for multi-turn reasoning tasks,\ndirectly applying GRPO leads to the sparse reward problem.\nGRPO computes a single reward for each sequence\nand uses this value for advantage calculation across the entire sequence.\nHowever, in multi-turn tasks,\nthe performance may vary significantly across different turns within a sequence.\nFor example, if the first turn performs poorly while the second turn performs well,\nbut the overall sequence reward is positive,\nthe poorly-performing first turn would still be rewarded,\nand the advantage of the well-performing second turn\nwould be diluted by the negative influence of the first turn.\nTo address this issue, we propose a novel reward design\nand the corresponding advantage calculation method for multi-turn reasoning, named mtGRPO.\nDuring a single RL rollout episode,\nthe PDM scorer independently scores the output of each turn\nand provides multiple rewards corresponding to the number of turns in the current rollout.\nUnlike GRPO, where a single reward value is assigned to the whole sequence,\nmtGRPO assigns the reward for each turn to the corresponding tokens of that turn,\ni.e., the reward from the first turn is assigned to the tokens of the first turn,\nthe second turn reward to the tokens of the second turn, and so on.\nWe also incorporate a format score for each turn\nto prevent degradation of format capability during RL training.\nWe provide the detailed reward calculation in Eq. (\n2\n),\nwhere\np\ni\n,\nj\np_{i,j}\ndenotes the PDM score of the\nj\nj\n-th turn in the\ni\ni\n-th rollout,\nand\nf\ni\n,\nj\nf_{i,j}\ndenotes the format score of the\nj\nj\n-th turn in the\ni\ni\n-th rollout.\nw\np\n=\n0.8\nw_{p}=0.8\nindicates the weight of the PDM score,\nand\nw\nf\n=\n0.2\nw_{f}=0.2\nindicates the weight of the format score.\nr\ni\n,\nj\n=\nw\np\n⋅\np\ni\n,\nj\n+\nw\nf\n⋅\nf\ni\n,\nj\nr_{i,j}=w_{p}\\cdot p_{i,j}+w_{f}\\cdot f_{i,j}\n(2)\nAfter the reward assignment,\nadvantage estimation is performed within each turn across the rollout batch,\nfollowing the same normalization method as GRPO.\nThe detailed advantage calculation is provided in Eq. (\n3\n),\nwhere\nG\nG\ndenotes the rollout number\nand\nA\n~\ni\n,\nt\n\\tilde{A}_{i,t}\ndenotes the advantage of the\nt\nt\n-th token in the\ni\ni\n-th rollout.\nThe indices\ni\ni\nand\nt\nt\nidentify which turn\nj\nj\nthe current token

veRL\n[\n33\n]\n,\na flexible RL post-training framework that supports rollout generation,\nactor and reference model inference, and policy optimization.\nIts wide adoption and active community make it well-suited for extension to multimodal AD tasks.\nWe extend veRL to support multi-turn interactions with a PDM-based environment\nfor vision-language autonomous driving.\nThe training pipeline operates iteratively, with each step consisting of:\n(1)\nRollout generation\n:\nthe policy interacts with the PDM agent across multiple turns\nto iteratively refine trajectories and receive PDMS-based rewards;\n(2)\nLog probability recomputation\n:\nforward pass through the actor model to obtain log probabilities;\n(3)\nReference model inference\n:\nforward pass through the reference model for KL regularization;\n(4)\nActor update\n:\nadvantage calculation and actor update via backpropagation.\nThis iterative process introduces data transfer bottlenecks in the multimodal setting.\nIn veRL’s architecture, the rollout generation runs as an independent process,\nrequiring all generated data including image tensors\nto be serialized and transferred through an object store.\nThis leads to two sources of overhead:\n(1)\ninter-process\n: rollout results must wait until the entire batch finishes\nbefore being serialized and dispatched to training workers;\n(2)\nintra-process\n: even when actor and reference model are co-located,\nthe controller dispatches data to each module separately,\ncausing redundant deserialization of the same inputs.\nWe address these challenges with two complementary optimizations,\nas illustrated in Fig.\n3\n.\nInter-Process Streaming Serialization (IPSS).\nIn multi-turn rollout, different samples complete at varying times\ndue to differences in response length.\nThe naive approach waits for all rollouts to finish before serializing the entire batch,\nleaving serialization time as pure overhead.\nWe observe that this serialization can be overlapped with generation:\nas each rollout completes, we immediately offload its multimodal data serialization\nto a dedicated thread pool, overlapping with the generation of remaining rollouts.\nIntra-Process Tensor Cache (IPTC).\nWhen log probability recomputation, reference model inference,\nand actor training are co-located in the same process,\nthe controller still dispatches data to each module separately,\ncausing redundant deserialization.\nTo eliminate this overhead, we implement a simple caching mechanism.\nUpon the first module’s execution, IPTC caches shared inputs\n(e.g., tokenized sequences, attention masks, and visual embeddings)\ndirectly in GPU memory.\nTogether, these optimizations reduce per-step training time\nfrom\n∼\n1250\n{\\sim}1250\ns to\n∼\n490\n{\\sim}490\ns (\n2.5\n×\n2.5\\times\nspeedup),\nwith IPSS contributing\n∼\n1.5\n×\n{\\sim}1.5\\times\nand IPTC\ncontributing an

Results\nTable\n1\npresents the performance of MTDrive and other models\non the NAVSIM dataset.\nWe report results under two perception settings:\n(1)\nKinematic model\n(\n∗\n),\nwhere surrounding agents are assumed to move at constant velocity—a practical setting for deployment;\n(2)\nGT Oracle\n(\n∗∗\n),\nusing privileged ground-truth boxes—suitable for auto-labeling applications.\nEven with SFT training alone, we achieve a performance of 88.1,\nimproving by 4.4 points compared to the single-turn baseline of 83.7,\nwhich demonstrates the strong capability of the multi-turn reasoning paradigm.\nWith RL training, MTDrive achieves a PDMS of 96.2 when using ground-truth perception inputs,\neven surpassing the human driving benchmark of 94.8.\nSpecifically, under the kinematic setting, MTDrive\n∗\nachieves 91.1,\ndemonstrating strong performance compared to traditional end-to-end methods.\nWith the GT oracle, MTDrive\n∗∗\nachieves 96.2,\ndemonstrating the potential of multi-turn reasoning for high-quality trajectory annotation.\nNotably, for the EP metric, we don’t provide EP information in the multi-turn prompts\n(as supplying EP information would reveal the ground truth trajectory).\nThe model attains this high EP score purely based on reward feedback during RL training.\n4.3\nAblation Study\nTable 2:\nAblation Study of SFT Training\nID\nOne Stage\nPDM

of each component in our method.\nThe ablation studies are structured along two dimensions: SFT vs. RL, and data vs. algorithm.\nFor all SFT experiments, we train for a total of 6 epochs\nand select the epoch with the highest score as the final result.\nTable\n2\nshows the impact of dataset volume\nand training methods on SFT training.\nIn Experiment 1, we follow RecogDrive by using only 80,000 single-turn samples\nfor SFT training, serving as our baseline.\nIn Experiment 2, we attempted two-stage SFT training:\nthe first stage uses 80,000 single-turn samples,\nand the second stage uses 50,000 2-turn samples.\nThe results show that 2-turn reasoning improves by 1.2 points\ncompared to the single-turn baseline.\nIn Experiment 3, we performed single-stage training\nwith 80,000 single-turn samples and 50,000 2-turn samples\nand observed an increase of 3.6 points in 2-turn performance\nover single-turn performance.\nIn Experiment 4, we introduced PDM understanding data,\nwhich led to improvements in 2-turn results with 0.4.\nFinally, in Experiment 5, we incorporated multi-turn data\nand increased the number of reasoning turns to 6,\nresulting in further gains in multi-turn PDMS scores with 88.1.\nThe highest score of our best-performing 6-turn SFT model was achieved at epoch 4.\nTable 3:\nAblation Study of RL

13,000-sample dataset\ndescribed in Section\n3.2\nand set the format weight to 0.2, as mentioned in Section\n3.3\n.\nIn Experiment 1, we adopt the GRPO,\nby averaging multi-turn rewards to obtain a sequence-level reward.\nExperimental results show that, compared to the baseline SFT model,\nthe PDMS score increased by 6.1 points.\nIn Experiment 2, we employ mtGRPO with intra-group normalization\nfor advantage calculation.\nThis further increases the PDMS score by 1 point.\nFinally, when we further modify mtGRPO to use cross-turn normalization\nwithin the group for advantage calculation,\nthe multi-turn score increases to 96.2 points.\n(a) Front-view images  (b) Multi-turn trajectory\nFigure 4:\nMulti-turn reasoning visualization.\nThe left figures represent images from the left, center, and right front-facing cameras,\nwhile the right figures display the results of one to multi turns of reasoning.\nIn the right images, red crosses indicate trajectory points that violate the DAC metric,\nsolid blue dots indicate obstacles where potential collisions may occur according to the TTC metric,\nand solid yellow dots indicate obstacles where collisions may occur according to the NC metric.\n4.4\nQualitative Results\nTo further demonstrate the ability of multi-turn reasoning to improve trajectory quality,\nFig.\n4\npresents 7 scenarios.\nIt can be observed that, during the first round of reasoning,\nthe model tends to aggressively explore forward trajectories.\nSubsequently, problematic trajectory points are progressively refined based on PDM feedback,\nwhile non-problematic points are preserved.\nIn the first 2 scenarios, the model initially generates trajectory points\noutside the drivable area which violates the DAC metric.\nIn subsequent reasoning turns, the model progressively corrects the problematic trajectories\nwhile preserving valid points near the ego vehicle.\nIn the 4th scenario, the initial trajectory generated in the first reasoning\npasses through the crosswalk, resulting in a potential collision risk with pedestrians.\nAfter receiving PDM feedback indicating potential pedestrian activity,\nit gradually adjusts the trajectory to stop before the crosswalk to avoid the collision.\nIn the 5th and 6th queueing scenarios at intersections,\nthe model first triggers NC and then TTC violations,\nand ultimately maintains a safe distance from the front vehicle by the 3rd turn.\nIn the last scenario, the model encounters a situation\nwhere the following vehicle is approaching at high speed, posing a rear-end collision risk.\nAfter 3 reasoning rounds, the model avoids the risk by accelerating its own speed.\nThese scenarios fully showcase the rationality and superiority\nof the multi-turn reasoning approach in autonomous driving.\n5\nConclusion\nIn this work, we propose MTDrive, a multi-turn VLM framework for autonomous driving.\nA multi-turn data generation pipeline is introduced to elicit the model’s reflective capabilities.\nBuilding on this foundation,\nmtGRPO is designed to address the sparse-reward challenge in multi-turn environments.\nFinally, for multimodal multi-turn RL training,\nwe implement two effective optimization techniques, IPSS and IPTC,\nto improve training throughput.\n6\nLimitations and Future Work\nPerception Dependency.\nOur current approach is a VLM-based planner that relies on perception ground truth\nor an additional perception module to provide PDM feedback.\nA promising direction for future work is to integrate perception data into the VLM,\nenabling the model to generate PDM feedback solely based on its own reasoning.\nSuch perception tasks are also expected to enhance the model’s understanding of the environment.\nAuto-Labeling.\nSince our current metrics even surpass those of human drivers,\nwe believe that the multi-turn reasoning framework holds promise for trajectory annotation,\noffering a high-quality alternative to human-driver data.\nThis could help address the lack of multimodal data in imitation learning for autonomous driving.\nGeneralization to Other Agents.\nWhile we instantiate our framework with the rule-based PDM Agent,\nthe multi-turn interaction paradigm can work with any agent that provides trajectory-level feedback.\nFuture work could explore learned reward agents or\nadapt the framework to agents in other simulation environments\n(e.g., CARLA\n[\n4\n]\n, Waymax\n[\n6\n]\n, AlpaSim\n[\n26\n]\n).\nReferences\n[1]\nA.

Where x, y, z are the center coordinates of the object in ego-coordinate system, l, w, h are length, width, height of the bounding box, heading is the object heading, and name is the object class name. The specific trajectory points and their corresponding objects are as follows:\\nTrajectory Point 1: (+21.73, 0.0, 0.0) with Objects: (34.14, -0.85, 1.59, 10.26, 2.95, 4.39, -0.02, vehicle).\\nBased on these issues, provide an improved trajectory prediction.\nAnswer\n: Here is the planning trajectory [PT, (+2.97, +0.02, 0.0), (+5.82, +0.02, 0.0), (+8.54, 0.0, -0.03), (+11.17, -0.07, -0.05), (+13.73, -0.22, -0.09), (+16.21, -0.56, -0.16), (+18.62, -1.10, -0.24), (+20.94, -1.77, -0.28)].\n0.A.2\npdm understanding data\nQuestion\n: <image>\\nYou are a vehicle trajectory prediction model for an autonomous driving system. One of your key metrics is Drivable Area Compliance (DAC), which assesses whether trajectory points remain within the drivable area. Given a trajectory prediction point and a front-view image, where trajectory point is formatted as (x: float, y: float, heading: float), your task is to identify if the given trajectory point stays within the drivable area.\\nTrajectory point is (+24.87, 0.0, 0.0).\\nOutput Requirements:\\nFormat: Yes or No\\nMaintain numerical precision to two decimal places.\nAnswer\n: No.\nAppendix 0.B\nMulti-turn Data Curation\nWe first train Qwen2.5VL on single-turn data,\nthis model is referred to as\nQwen2.5VL_sft1\n,\nto obtain a model with basic trajectory generation abilities.\nWe then use\nQwen2.5VL_sft1\nto perform inference on the single-turn dataset,\nobtaining sequences of predicted trajectories.\nBy feeding the generated trajectories into the PDM agent,\nwe obtain the corresponding PDM feedback.\nThen we concatenate the prompts from the single-turn data,\nthe model-generated trajectories, and the corresponding PDM feedback,\nto construct the prompt for the second turn data,\nusing the same ground-truth from the single-turn data as the second turn’s ground-truth.\nWe further employ the constant velocity model provided by NAVSIM to follow the above steps and generate additional 2-turn data, because 2-turn samples from\nQwen2.5VL_sft1\nare far fewer than single-turn ones.\nThen we follow the above steps with 2-turn data to get\nQwen2.5VL_sft2\nand 3-turn data. For the subsequent turn data, we did not continue the above process due to computational resource constraints. Instead, we directly use the three-turn model to construct data for subsequent turns.\nSpecifically, we run the\nQwen2.5VL_sft2\nmodel multiple times on the same data\nto produce different 3-turn sequences, and stack these sequences together,\nwhich we refer to as mock multi-turn data.\nSince our mock multi-turn data is not entirely derived from real agent inference results,\nits distribution does not match real multi-turn reasoning,\nwe only use a subset of it to stimulate the model’s multi-turn trajectory reasoning capability.\nNow we have obtained all multi-turn data,\nincluding 2-turn, 3-turn, and mock multi-turn data.\nAppendix 0.C\nAdditional Ablation\nWe also study the impact of dataset size on RL performance.\nThis ablation was performed using an earlier version of our approach; due to resource constraints, we are unable to rerun it with the latest version.\nTherefore, we present indicative conclusions instead of reporting precise quantitative results.\nWhen training with only 7,000 hard samples described in Section\n3.2\n, the PDM score exhibits a minor increase within the first 30 steps, but then quickly declines.\nEvaluation on the 7,000 training set reveals clear signs of overfitting.\nThen we increase the dataset size to 13,000, 26,000, and 39,000 samples; the overall trend remains similar to that observed with 13,000 samples: convergence is slightly slower, but the performance metrics at 300 steps are very close.",

Integrating Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in addressing \"long-tail\" scenarios. However, existing methods are constrained to single-turn reasoning, limiting their ability to handle complex tasks requiring iterative refinement. To overcome this limitation, we present MTDrive, a multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to iteratively refine trajectories based on environmental feedback. MTDrive introduces Multi-Turn Group Relative Policy Optimization (mtGRPO), which mitigates reward sparsity by computing relative advantages across turns. We further construct an interactive trajectory understanding dataset from closed-loop simulation to support multi-turn training. Experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our multi-turn reasoning paradigm. Additionally, we implement system-level optimizations to reduce data transfer overhead caused by high-resolution images and multi-turn sequences, achieving 2.5x training throughput.
