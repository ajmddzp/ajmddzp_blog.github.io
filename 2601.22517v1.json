While Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a principled framework for strategic interaction, its direct application to humanoid control is hindered by high-dimensional contact dynamics and the absence of strong physical motion priors. We propose RoboStriker, a hierarchical three-stage framework that enables fully autonomous humanoid boxing by decoupling high-level strategic reasoning from low-level physical execution. The framework first learns a comprehensive repertoire of boxing skills by training a single-agent motion tracker on human motion capture data. These skills are subsequently distilled into a structured latent manifold, regularized by projecting the Gaussian-parameterized distribution onto a unit hypersphere. This topological constraint effectively confines exploration to the subspace of physically plausible motions. In the final stage, we introduce Latent-Space Neural Fictitious Self-Play (LS-NFSP), where competing agents learn competitive tactics by interacting within the latent action space rather than the raw motor space, significantly stabilizing multi-agent training. Experimental results demonstrate that RoboStriker achieves superior competitive performance in simulation and exhibits sim-to-real transfer. Our website is available at\nRoboStriker\n.\nMachine Learning, ICML\nFigure 1\n:\nReal-world clips of humanoid boxing using RoboStriker, showcasing agile, contact-rich punches and defenses under physical constraints.\n1\nIntroduction\nHumanoid robots serve as a critical frontier for embodied intelligence, with recent breakthroughs demonstrating exceptional capabilities in locomotion and agile maneuvers\n(Liao\net al.\n,\n2025\n; Yin\net al.\n,\n2025\n; Zeng\net al.\n,\n2025\n; Zhang\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\n. These successes, however, have largely focused on single-agent execution, where the environment is passive and predefined. Once other agents are introduced, as in competitive physical interactions such as boxing, the problem fundamentally shifts from motion-generation to strategic co-adaptation under physical constraints.\nThis shift naturally situates humanoid competition within the scope of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL).\nYet, unlike symbolic or abstract domains where MARL has achieved grandmaster-level success\n(Silver\net al.\n,\n2017\n; Vinyals\net al.\n,\n2019\n)\n, embodied humanoid competition requires reasoning through high-dimensional, contact-rich dynamics, where every strategic decision is physically bound by balance stability and actuation limits. At this frontier of multi-agent embodiment, we argue that there lie two intrinsic and domain-agnostic contradictions that characterize the competitive humanoid systems.\nPhysical Feasibility vs. Non-stationary Learning.\nHumanoid control operates in a high-dimensional continuous action space, which is subject to strict physical constraints, including contact stability, joint limits and underactuated dynamics. Effective strategy exploration, however, requires diverse and sometimes aggressive behaviors. As a result, such unconstrained policy exploration often leads to physically invalid motions and fails to keep balance\n(Peng\net al.\n,\n2018\n,\n2021\n)\n, while overly restrictive controllers collapse strategy learning. This further creates an embodied cold-start problem: agents cannot evolve competitive strategies without first maintaining a stable physical stance\n(Luo\net al.\n,\n2023\n)\n.\nStrategy Evolution vs. System Stability.\nMARL via self-play\n(Samuel,\n1959\n; Hernandez\net al.\n,\n2019\n)\nrelies on continuously evolving opponent policies, which introduces severe non-stationarity during training. While such dynamics are essential for discovering competitive strategies, humanoid systems are dynamically fragile: small distributional shifts in opponent behavior can destabilize balance and contact, leading to training collapse. This results in another tension between competitive strategy evolution and stable embodied interaction.\nExisting approaches address these challenges in an isolated manner. Game-theoretic MARL methods such as Neural Fictitious Self-Play (NFSP)\n(Heinrich and Silver,\n2016\n)\nare designed for abstract or weakly grounded environments, lacking inductive biases for physical feasibility. Conversely, embodied control frameworks such as Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP)\n(Peng\net al.\n,\n2021\n)\nand DeepMimic\n(Peng\net al.\n,\n2018\n)\nexcel at learning robust single-agent motor skills via imitation, but do not support strategic co-evolution or opponent-aware adaptation. As a result, neither line of work alone can resolve the dual contradictions inherent to embodied competitive tasks.\nIn this work, we argue that resolving these challenges requires a structured decoupling of physical control and strategic reasoning, coupled with a training mechanism that stabilizes competitive evolution. To this end, we propose a hierarchical framework that decomposes embodied MARL into three coupled layers: (1) physically grounded motion library, (2) structured latent motion space for strategy representation and (3) multi-agent strategy evolution over this latent space.\nConcretely, in the first layer, we establish a DeepMimic-based tracking policy\n(Peng\net al.\n,\n2018\n)\nto faithfully reproduce diverse human motion primitives, ensuring the agent masters a repertoire of physically feasible kinematic skills. In the second layer, we construct a bounded latent motion space that supports diverse motion generation and serves as the effective strategy space. In the third layer, we perform competitive strategy learning via NFSP, namely Latent Space NFSP (LS-NFSP), which enables latent multi-agent co-evolution within the bounded latent manifold.\nCrucially, the bounded latent motion space is not merely a representational choice, it defines a compact, physically safe strategy search space that allows LS-NFSP to operate without inducing motor-level instability. Meanwhile, AMP-based\n(Peng\net al.\n,\n2021\n)\ncurriculum warmup initializes the policy within this manifold, mitigating the competitive cold-start problem and substantially reducing the non-stationarity during fictitious self-play. Together, these mechanisms resolve the aforementioned contradictions of embodied MARL by reconciling physical stability with strategic diversity, and stabilizing strategy evolution under continuous competition.\nWe evaluate our framework on a humanoid boxing task using Unitree G1 robots with 29 degrees of freedom\n(Unitree,\n2024\n)\n, demonstrating that the proposed method achieves substantially improved performance, robustness, and convergence stability compared to existing baselines. Beyond this specific task, our framework provides a general recipe for embodied multi-agent competition, offering a principled pathway to scale MARL from abstract games to physically grounded robotic systems. Our contributions are summarized as follows:\n•\nTo the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to formally characterize the intrinsic contradictions in embodied MARL, specifically the trade-off between physical feasibility and non-stationary learning, and the conflict between strategy evolution and system stability, using humanoid competition as a prime instantiation.\n•\nWe propose a hierarchical framework that decouples high-level strategic reasoning from low-level physical execution, providing a stable pathway for evolving dynamic combat behaviors.\n•\nWe demonstrate the robustness of our framework through the emergence of tactical boxing in simulation and its zero-shot transfer to physical humanoid robots (\nFigure 1\n).\nFigure 2\n:\nOverview of RoboStriker.\nStage I\npretrains a motion tracker to produce physically plausible humanoid behaviors;\nStage II\ncompresses these behaviors into a bounded latent space for high-level control;\nStage III(a)\nruns warm-up training on top of Stage II, then followed with\nStage III(b)\n, a NFSP over latent-space to solve the humanoid boxing task as a two-player zero-sum game.\n2\nRelated Work\nHumanoid Motion Synthesis and Control.\nThe generation of lifelike humanoid movement has evolved from purely kinematic trajectory synthesis to physics-aware control policies.\nKinematic Motion Synthesis historically relied on Inverse Kinematics (IK) and space-time optimization to retarget motion capture data onto robotic morphologies while satisfying joint and geometric constraints\n(Gleicher,\n1998\n; Yamane\net al.\n,\n2004\n)\n. While deep generative models have significantly improved the diversity of synthesized trajectories\n(Holden\net al.\n,\n2016\n; Zhang\net al.\n,\n2023\n; Petrovich\net al.\n,\n2023\n; Yin\net al.\n,\n2024\n)\n, these purely kinematic approaches lack dynamical awareness, often resulting in physical violations like \"foot sliding\" when transferred to simulators.\nPhysics-based control addresses the challenge of executing motions within a dynamical environment by accounting for gravity, inertia, and contact forces. Classical robot learning methods utilize Zero Moment Point (ZMP) stability and Model Predictive Control (MPC) to ensure bipedal balance\n(Kajita\net al.\n,\n2003\n; Kuindersma\net al.\n,\n2016\n)\n. Modern reinforcement learning (RL)\n(Sutton\net al.\n,\n1998\n)\nhas advanced this through tracking-based imitation\n(Peng\net al.\n,\n2018\n)\nand adversarial stylistic regularization\n(Peng\net al.\n,\n2021\n)\n. Crucially, the development of universal motion trackers\n(Chen\net al.\n,\n2025\n; Yin\net al.\n,\n2025\n; Zhang\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\nhas enabled the learning of unified policies capable of tracking a diverse repertoire of human motions. While these universal trackers provide a robust foundation for executing a vast library of skills, they primarily focus on high-fidelity imitation of pre-defined trajectories. In contrast, our work builds upon universal tracking but extends it to a reactive, multi-agent setting, where the controller must maintain physical stability while simultaneously adapting to the non-stationary perturbations of an opponent.\nSkill-based Latent Representation Learning.\nTo manage the complexity of humanoid action spaces, recent research has shifted toward learning low-level skills in latent manifolds. PULSE\n(Luo\net al.\n,\n2023\n)\nestablishes that distilling vast motion capture datasets into latent embeddings allows high-level policies to invoke complex behaviors via a simplified behavioral interface. Further refinements like CALM\n(Tessler\net al.\n,\n2023\n)\nhave improved the semantic diversity and controllability of these latent spaces. However, these manifolds are typically treated as unbounded Euclidean spaces where unconstrained exploration can still lead to out-of-distribution actions that cause physical collapse. We depart from this by imposing topological regularization—projecting the latent space onto a unit hypersphere\n(Peng\net al.\n,\n2022\n; Davidson\net al.\n,\n2018\n)\n. This geometric constraint ensures that the strategic search remains bounded within a manifold of physically plausible maneuvers, effectively isolating the high-level policy from the dynamical instabilities of the robot’s joints.\nIn this work, we leverage this topologically constrained manifold to decouple strategic reasoning from dynamics control, enabling the efficient evolution of complex competitive behaviors that would be intractable in raw observation spaces\nMulti-Agent RL and Fictitious Self-Play.\nSelf-play has emerged as a principled paradigm for learning robust policies in competitive settings by framing training as an implicit game-solving process. Classical fictitious play\n(Brown,\n1951\n)\niteratively best-responds to the empirical distribution of past opponents and is known to converge to a Nash equilibrium in certain classes of games. Modern adaptations of fictitious self-play (FSP) integrate reinforcement learning with historical policy averaging, achieving strong empirical performance in large-scale imperfect-information games such as poker\n(Heinrich and Silver,\n2016\n)\n. Subsequent extensions have explored continuous control and function approximation, showing that approximate best-response dynamics can converge to approximate Nash equilibria under bounded strategy spaces and smoothness assumptions\n(Mertikopoulos and Zhou,\n2019\n)\n. Despite these advances, applying self-play directly in high-dimensional MARL often leads to cyclic strategic oscillations and training instabilities, particularly when policies operate in unconstrained continuous action spaces\n(Lanctot\net al.\n,\n2017\n)\n. Recent works have highlighted that constraining the effective strategy space—through regularization, policy parameterization, or latent abstractions—can significantly improve convergence behavior and stability in competitive learning\n(Balduzzi and Racaniere,\n2018\n)\n. From a game-theoretic perspective, restricting policies to a compact, continuous strategy set ensures the existence of mixed-strategy Nash equilibria and supports convergence guarantees for no-regret and fictitious-play-style dynamics\n(Rosen,\n1965\n; Ramazi and Cao,\n2020\n)\n.\nOur work builds on this line of research by situating fictitious self-play within a bounded latent strategy manifold. By conducting the competitive learning process in a compact hyperspherical latent space rather than the raw motor command space, we effectively limit the strategic degrees of freedom available to each agent. This design mitigates non-stationarity arising from unbounded policy updates and aligns the training dynamics with theoretical convergence results for approximate Nash equilibria in continuous games with compact strategy sets.\n3\nMethod\nWe propose a hierarchical competitive learning framework that enables fully autonomous humanoid boxing through structured decision making in a continuous latent strategy space. The interaction between two humanoid agents is formalized as a two-player zero-sum Markov game, where each agent selects high-level motion intents rather than direct motor commands. A shared expert motion decoder executes these intents while preserving physical feasibility and human-like behaviors. Training proceeds through a three-stage pipeline: learning a robust low-level motion tracker from human demonstrations (Section\n3.2\n), distilling motion primitives into a bounded continuous latent space that serves as the strategic action space (Section\n3.3\n), and progressively introducing competition via behavioral warmup (Section\n3.4\n) and Latent-Space Neural Fictitious Self-Play (LS-NFSP) (Section\n3.5\n). This design decouples strategic reasoning from low-level control, stabilizes multi-agent learning and facilitates convergence toward approximate Nash equilibria in high-dimensional humanoid combat scenarios.\n3.1\nTwo-player Zero-sum Markov Games\nWe define a two-player zero-sum Markov Game as\nℳ\n=\n⟨\nℐ\n,\n𝒮\n,\n{\n𝒪\n}\ni\n∈\nℐ\n,\n{\n𝒵\n}\ni\n∈\nℐ\n,\n𝒫\n,\n{\n𝒰\n}\ni\n∈\nℐ\n,\nγ\n⟩\n\\mathcal{M}=\\langle\\mathcal{I},\\mathcal{S},\\{\\mathcal{O}\\}^{i\\in\\mathcal{I}},\\{\\mathcal{Z}\\}^{i\\in\\mathcal{I}},\\mathcal{P},\\{\\mathcal{U}\\}^{i\\in\\mathcal{I}},\\gamma\\rangle\n.\nℐ\n=\n{\n1\n,\n2\n}\n\\mathcal{I}=\\{1,2\\}\nthe set of players,\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\nthe state space,\n{\n𝒪\n}\ni\n∈\nℐ\n\\{\\mathcal{O}\\}^{i\\in\\mathcal{I}}\nthe set of player observation spaces.

To this end, rather than allowing unconstrained latent representations, we normalize latent codes onto a compact manifold, which restricts motion commands to a physically plausible set and prevents out-of-distribution execution by the decoder. Under this formulation, each latent action\nz\n∈\n𝒵\nz\\in\\mathcal{Z}\nfully specifies an motion decision, and we therefore model\n𝒵\n\\mathcal{Z}\nas the effective strategy space of the induced two-player game in Section\n3.1\n. In implementation, we let\nz\nz\nsatisfies the requirements with normalization as\nz\n^\n=\nNormalize\n​\n(\nz\n)\n=\nE\nϕ\n​\n(\no\n)\n‖\nE\nϕ\n​\n(\no\n)\n‖\n2\n,\n\\hat{z}=\\mathrm{Normalize}(z)=\\frac{E_{\\phi}(o)}{\\|E_{\\phi}(o)\\|_{2}},\n(8)\nthereby constraining the latent representation of\nz\nz\nto lie on the unit hypersphere. The total training objective is detailed in Appendix\nB\n.\n3.4\nBehavioral Warmup with Adversarial Priors\nConsidering direct competitive self-play from scratch is unstable due to the lack of basic tactical competence. We therefore introduce a behavioral warmup stage, where agents learn effective striking behaviors against a stationary opponent that strictly maintains a stable standing stance. A learnable residual policy\nπ\nθ\n(\n⋅\n∣\ns\nt\ngoal\n)\n\\pi_{\\theta}(\\cdot\\mid s^{\\mathrm{goal}}_{t})\nis defined as outputs residual latent commands\nΔ\n​\nz\nt\n\\Delta z_{t}\nover a fixed behavioral prior\nP\nξ\n⟂\nP^{\\perp}_{\\xi}\nfrom the second stage, ensuring stable and human-like motions.\nThen, the complete form of\nπ\nz\n\\pi_{z}\nis\nπ\nz\n(\n⋅\n∣\ns\nprop\n,\ns\ngoal\n)\n=\nπ\nθ\n(\n⋅\n∣\ns\ngoal\n)\n⊕\nP\nξ\n⟂\n(\n⋅\n∣\ns\nt\nprop\n)\n,\n\\pi_{z}(\\cdot\\mid s^{\\mathrm{prop}},s^{\\mathrm{goal}})=\\pi_{\\theta}(\\cdot\\mid s^{\\mathrm{goal}})\\oplus P^{\\perp}_{\\xi}(\\cdot\\mid s^{\\mathrm{prop}}_{t}),\n(9)\nand the corresponding generation of\nz\nt\nz_{t}\nis formulated as\nz\nt\n=\nNormalize\n​\n(\nΔ\n​\nz\nt\n+\nz\nt\np\n)\n,\nz_{t}=\\mathrm{Normalize}(\\Delta z_{t}+z^{p}_{t}),\n(10)\nwhere\nΔ\nz\nt\n∼\nπ\nθ\n(\n⋅\n∣\ns\ngoal\n)\n\\Delta z_{t}\\sim\\pi_{\\theta}(\\cdot\\mid s^{\\mathrm{goal}})\nand\nz\nt\np\n∼\nP\nξ\n⟂\n(\n⋅\n∣\ns\nprop\n)\nz^{p}_{t}\\sim P^{\\perp}_{\\xi}(\\cdot\\mid s^{\\mathrm{prop}})\n.\nTo prevent degeneration of motion quality, we regularize the warmup training with AMP\n(Peng\net al.\n,\n2021\n)\n. Specifically, a discriminator\nC\nC\nis trained to distinguish motion transitions generated by the agent operating via the frozen decoder\nD\nψ\nD_{\\psi}\nfrom reference motion data, providing a style-consistency reward\nr\nstyle\nr_{\\mathrm{style}}\n.

The detail of the task observation\ns\nt\ngoal\ns_{t}^{\\mathrm{goal}}\n, the task reward definition and the AMP practice is illustrated in the Appendix\nC\n.\n3.5\nLatent-Space Neural Fictitious Self-Play\nBuilding on the behavioral warmup stage, we adopt Latent-Space Neural Fictitious Self-Play (LS-NFSP) to enable competitive co-evolution. Our approach inherit the core principles of Neural Fictitious Self-Play (NFSP)\n(Heinrich and Silver,\n2016\n)\n, while implementing them over a structured latent action space\n𝒵\n\\mathcal{Z}\nrather than the raw motor space. In LS-NFSP, each player is controlled by an independent LS-NFSP agent that learns through simultaneous self-play interactions with its opponents. An LS-NFSP agent interacts with its opponents and records its experience into two buffers, a reinforcement learning dataset\n𝒟\nR\n​\nL\n\\mathcal{D}_{RL}\nthat stores transitions and a supervised learning dataset\n𝒟\nS\n​\nL\n\\mathcal{D}_{SL}\nthat stores its own best-response behaviors. These two datasets are treated distinctly, corresponding to reinforcement learning and supervised learning objectives, respectively. For each agent, we train an RL policy\nπ\nz\nR\n​\nL\n\\pi^{RL}_{z}\nvia PPO\n(Schulman\net al.\n,\n2017\n)\non samples from\n𝒟\nR\n​\nL\n\\mathcal{D}_{RL}\n. In parallel, we train an average policy\nπ\n¯\nz\n\\bar{\\pi}_{z}\nfrom\n𝒟\nS\n​\nL\n\\mathcal{D}_{SL}\nwith supervised learning, to imitate the agent’s historical best-response behaviors. Concretely, over learning iterations\nk\n=\n1\n,\n…\n,\nK\nk=1,\\dots,K\n, the supervised dataset is incrementally updated as\n𝒟\nS\n​\nL\nk\n=\n𝒟\nS\n​\nL\nk\n−\n1\n∪\n𝒟\nR\n​\nL\nk\n,\n∀\nk\n=\n1\n,\n…\n,\nK\n.\n\\mathcal{D}^{k}_{SL}=\\mathcal{D}^{k-1}_{SL}\\cup\\mathcal{D}^{k}_{RL},\\forall k=1,\\dots,K.\n(12)\nAction selection over latent space\n𝒵\n\\mathcal{Z}\nfollows an mixture strategy with\nη\n∈\n[\n0\n,\n1\n)\n\\eta\\in[0,1)\n.\nFormally, the mixed strategy is defined as\nσ\n=\nη\n⋅\nπ\n¯\nz\n+\n(\n1\n−\nη\n)\n⋅\nπ\nz\nR\n​\nL\n,\n\\sigma=\\eta\\cdot\\bar{\\pi}_{z}+(1-\\eta)\\cdot\\pi^{RL}_{z},\n(13)\nand latent actions are sampled as\nz\nt\n∼\nσ\n(\n⋅\n∣\ns\nt\nprop\n,\ns\nt\ngoal\n)\nz_{t}\\sim\\sigma(\\cdot\\mid s^{\\mathrm{prop}}_{t},s^{\\mathrm{goal}}_{t})\n. Under this formulation,\nπ\nz\nR\n​\nL\n\\pi^{RL}_{z}\nrepresents an approximate best response to the opponents’ mixed strategies\nσ\n−\ni\n\\sigma^{-i}\n, while\nπ\n¯\nz\n\\bar{\\pi}_{z}\napproximates the agent’s long-run average strategy. We summarize the pseudo algorithm of LS-NFSP in Appendix\nD\n.\n3.6\nTheoretical Analysis\nTo analyze learning dynamics in our induced latent game, we first explicitly state a set of modeling assumptions that reflect both our hierarchical motion abstraction and the mathematical requirements for grounding equilibrium analysis in continuous strategy domains.\nAssumption 3.2\n(Bounded Continuous Latent Space)\n.\nEach agent’s high-level policy\nπ\nz\n\\pi_{z}\nis built on latent space\n𝒵\n\\mathcal{Z}\n, where\n𝒵\n⊂\nℝ\nd\n\\mathcal{Z}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{d}\nis a compact continuous set. In our implementation,\n𝒵\n\\mathcal{Z}\nis the unit hypersphere\n𝕊\nd\n−\n1\n\\mathbb{S}^{d-1}\n, ensuring boundedness of the latent space.\nAssumption 3.3\n(Well-Defined and Bounded Payoffs)\n.\nThe interaction between agents induces an effective two-player zero-sum game with payoff functions\nu\ni\n​\n(\nz\ni\n,\nz\n−\ni\n)\nu_{i}(z_{i},z_{-i})\nfor arbitrary\ns\n∈\n𝒮\ns\\in\\mathcal{S}\n, where the expectation is taken over environment stochasticity and low-level policy execution. We assume the payoff functions are bounded and measurable over\n𝒮\n×\n𝒵\n×\n𝒵\n\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{Z}\\times\\mathcal{Z}\n.\nAssumption 3.4\n(Approximate Best-Response Updates)\n.\nAt each iteration, each agent updates its latent strategy by approximately best-responding to the empirical distribution of its opponent’s past strategies. The approximation error introduced by finite-horizon rollouts and stochastic optimization is assumed to be bounded.\nAssumption\n3.2\nand\n3.3\nare motivated by Glicksberg’s existence theorem\n(Glicksberg,\n1952\n)\n, which ensures that a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium exists when each player’s strategy set is non-empty and compact, and the payoff functions are continuous. Beyond these structural conditions on the strategy space, the analysis of self-play dynamics further requires assumptions on the learning process itself. In our framework, high-level policies are optimized via NFSP, which alternates between computing approximate best responses and updating average strategies. We therefore abstract this optimization procedure as an approximate best-response dynamic in the induced latent game (Assumption\n3.4\n). Together, these assumptions establish a coherent analytical setting in which the latent game admits an equilibrium and we can derive approximate convergence results presented below.\nProposition 3.5\n.\nUnder Assumptions\n3.2\nto\n3.4\n, the induced latent interaction admits the standard regularity conditions under which FSP dynamics in continuous zero-sum game are known to approach approximate Nash Equilibrium. Consequently, LS-NFSP will converge to an\nϵ\n\\epsilon\n-Nash Equilibrium of the induced game, up to bounded approximation error.\nProof.\nSee\nAppendix E\n.\n∎\n4\nExperiment\nPolicy training is performed in Isaac Lab\n(NVIDIA\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\non the NVIDIA Omniverse platform, leveraging large-scale parallel simulation for efficient data collection. The simulated platform is the Unitree G1 humanoid\n(Unitree,\n2024\n)\n, featuring 29 degrees of freedom. All experiments are trained on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU. To improve robustness and encourage the emergence of transferable tactical behaviors, we apply domain randomization\n(Tobin\net al.\n,\n2017\n)\nto contact friction, link masses, and actuator gains. Our evaluation is designed to answer the following questions:\n(i) does the proposed method achieve superior converged performance compared to relevant baselines?\nand\n(ii) do the introduced components—including the behavioral warm-up, and AMP—contribute positively to overall performance?\nTable 1\n:\nWin Rate (%) of Cross-Playing.

Thus, we introduces two metrics as\nOffensive Landing Rate\n(\nη\nhit\n\\eta_{\\mathrm{hit}}\n) and\nEngagement Rate\n(\nE\n​\nR\nER\n).\nη\nhit\n\\eta_{\\mathrm{hit}}\nis identified by the proportion of contacts exceeding the force threshold to the total number of offensive attempts.\nE\n​\nR\nER\nacts as a rigorous measure of an agent’s ability to maintain a viable combat posture, effectively penalizing tactical avoidance or non-confrontational movement patterns, the higher the better, and it is calculated as the proportion of the episode duration in which the agent concurrently satisfies two spatial conditions: (1) keep a distance within an effective striking range and (2) ensuring a facing alignment that exceeds a predefined threshold.\nPhysical Stability.\nPhysical stability is assessed through\nBase Orientation Stability\n(\nB\n​\nO\n​\nS\nBOS\n) and\nTorque Smoothness\n(\nT\n​\nS\nτ\nTS_{\\tau}\n). To ensure a positive correlation with control quality,\nB\n​\nO\n​\nS\nBOS\nis defined using an exponential kernels on the angular deviation:\nB\n​\nO\n​\nS\n=\n𝔼\n​\n[\nexp\n⁡\n(\n−\n‖\n𝐠\nbase\n−\n𝐠\nworld\n‖\n2\n)\n]\nBOS=\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\exp(-\\|\\mathbf{g}_{\\mathrm{base}}-\\mathbf{g}_{\\mathrm{world}}\\|^{2})\\right]\n, where\n𝐠\nbase\n\\mathbf{g}_{\\mathrm{base}}\nand\n𝐠\nworld\n\\mathbf{g}_{\\mathrm{world}}\nthe gravity vector in the robot’s local frame and the global frame, respectively.

A lower\nT\n​\nS\nτ\nTS_{\\tau}\nvalue represents more hardware-friendly execution and reduced mechanical wear.\nStylistic Authenticity.\nThe Stylistic Authenticity of the emergent behaviors is evaluated via qualitative visual inspection. Instead of relying on a singular numerical score, we provide a comparative analysis of simulation snapshots to assess the human-likeness of the motions. This includes identifying key boxing maneuvers such as slips, counters, and rhythmic footwork, while ensuring the absence of unnatural joint configurations or physically unsustainable postures that often characterize non-constrained reinforcement learning policies.\nTable 3\n:\nTactical performance comparison focusing on Offensive Landing Rate and Engagement Rate.

The most critical insight is the superiority of performing competitive self-play within a structured latent manifold. We notice that the LS-NFSP agent dominates 29Dof Action-Space SP agent with a 100.00% win rate and also performs superior tactical and physical proficiency (\nTable 2\n), proving that decoupling balance maintenance from tactical exploration is a fundamental prerequisite for competitive learning in high-dimensional humanoid combat. And for the comparison between self-play methods with latent space, LS-NFSP also outperforms the other methods, in the result of Fictitious SP of 68.52% and Naive SP of 76.24%, confirming that the integration of NFSP effectively mitigates policy cycling to produce a more robust best response. The necessity of each training stage is further validated by the substantial performance gaps against Direct-SP of 98.50% and Static-Target Specialist of 95.38%, which fail to respectively overcome reward sparsity and reactive dynamic opponents. Additionally, the No-AMP variant exhibits reduced tactical efficiency of 82.41% win rate against Ours due to its non-standardized movement patterns. Finally, the significant win rate against the PPO-Only baseline of 84.47% underscores that competitive interaction is the indispensable driver of emergent combat behaviors.\n4.3\nAblation Study\nTo answer the second question, we conduct ablation study from two perspectives, i.e., whether the strategy prior, warm-up and AMP can benefit the policy training.\nFigure 3\n:\nt-SNE visualization of the 32-dimensional latent manifold, illustrating the structured semantic clustering of combat primitives and their topological relationships that facilitate stable, compositional behavioral transitions in the hierarchical LS-NFSP framework.\nStrategy Priors.\nTable 3\n(a) underscores the necessity of both competitive strategy priors in achieving elite boxing proficiency. LS-NFSP demonstrates superior tactical performance by achieving\nη\nhit\n=\n0.685\n\\eta_{\\mathrm{hit}}=0.685\nand\nE\n​\nR\n=\n0.824\nER=0.824\n, which significantly outperforms baselines.\nWarm-Up Training.\nAs shown in\nTable 3\n(c), the necessity of leveraging warm-up is further evidenced by the collapse of the Direct-SP variant. Despite competitive access, it achieves a negligible\nη\nhit\n=\n0.050\n\\eta_{\\mathrm{hit}}=0.050\n, proving its inability to overcome the inefficiency due to reward sparsity settings.\nAdversarial Motion Prior.\nWe further evaluate the impact of stylistic constraints rigorously as in\nTable 3\n(d). While the variant achieves\nE\n​\nR\n=\n0.720\nER=0.720\n, its\nη\nhit\n\\eta_{\\mathrm{hit}}\ndrops sharply to 0.490. This discrepancy reveals that, without AMP, the agent can approach the opponent but executes erratic strikes that difficult to contact opponent effectively, as\nFigure 4\ndemonstrates that the policy trained without AMP lacks physical authenticity. Ultimately, these results prove that the synergy of NFSP-driven exploration and AMP-guided movement is essential for producing a controller that is both strategically dominant and physically authentic.\nFigure 4\n:\nMujoco visualization of the LS-NFSP and the one without AMP.\n4.4\nAnalysis of the Learned Latent Space\nTo investigate the underlying structure of the latent skills, we perform a joint t-SNE\n(Maaten and Hinton,\n2008\n)\nanalysis on the generated embeddings, as illustrated in\nFigure 3\n. The visualization reveals a highly structured manifold with a distinct topological arrangement: there is a clear separation between the pure\nMove\n(purple) and pure\nStrike\n(pink) clusters. This demarcation indicates that the latent space successfully disentangles stable locomotion dynamics from high-momentum offensive maneuvers. Crucially,\nMove+Strike\n(blue) embeddings occupy the intermediate space, exhibiting significant overlap with both\nMove\nand\nStrike\nregions. This dual overlap suggests that the\nMove+Strike\nmode functions as a topological bridge, seamlessly connecting the two distinct primitives. Such a structure provides empirical evidence of the latent space’s compositional nature, enabling the LS-NFSP framework to smoothly interpolate between navigation and combat. This allows the agent to initiate attacks dynamically while moving, without suffering from the discontinuity or instability typically associated with switching between disjoint control modes.\n5\nConclusion\nWe propose a hierarchical competitive framework for humanoid interaction that integrates latent-space control with Neural Fictitious Self-Play (LS-NFSP). By decoupling high-level tactical strategy from low-level balance control via a pre-trained latent manifold, our approach ensures physical stability while enabling the emergence of sophisticated boxing maneuvers like slip-and-counter tactics. Experimental results from an\n8\n×\n8\n8\\times 8\ncross-play tournament, supported by qualitative snapshots and t-SNE analysis, demonstrate that LS-NFSP consistently outperforms baselines in both competitive win rate and stylistic authenticity. Ultimately, this work proves that the synergy of hierarchical latent representations and competitive self-play provides a robust and scalable solution for achieving tactical intelligence in high-dimensional humanoid robotics.\nReferences\nJ.

The dataset consists of 46 original motion clips with a total duration of approximately 14 minutes, captured at a frequency of 50 Hz. These clips cover a wide range of boxing behaviors, including offensive strikes, defensive maneuvers, footwork, and transitional movements.\nTo increase data diversity and improve generalization, we augment the dataset through left-right mirroring, effectively doubling the number of available motion sequences.\nThe captured human motions are retargeted to the Unitree G1 humanoid\n(Unitree,\n2024\n)\nmorphology following the Generalized Motion Retargeting (GMR) framework\n(Araujo\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\n. Through this retargeting process, we obtain physically realizable reference trajectories dataset\n𝒟\nmotion\n\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{motion}}\nthat preserve the stylistic characteristics and temporal structure of the original boxing motions.\nA.2\nReinforcement Learning Settings and Training Details\nState, Observation and Action Spaces.\nThe state of the tracking policy is defined as\ns\nt\nself\n=\n(\ns\nt\nprop\n,\ns\nt\npriv\n)\ns_{t}^{\\mathrm{self}}=(s_{t}^{\\mathrm{prop}},s_{t}^{\\mathrm{priv}})\n,\nwhere\ns\nt\nprop\ns_{t}^{\\mathrm{prop}}\ndenotes the proprioceptive state, including base angular velocities, relative joint positions, and joint velocities, and\ns\nt\npriv\ns_{t}^{\\mathrm{priv}}\ndenotes privileged information, including base linear velocities, global base position and orientation, body link poses, and contact states.\nThe observation\n𝐨\ntrk\n∈\n𝒪\n\\mathbf{o}_{\\mathrm{trk}}\\in\\mathcal{O}\nconsists of three components:\n(i) the proprioceptive state\ns\nt\nprop\ns_{t}^{\\mathrm{prop}}\n;\n(ii) the reference motion state\ns\nt\nref\n∼\nτ\nref\ns_{t}^{\\mathrm{ref}}\\sim\\tau^{\\mathrm{ref}}\n, which provides target full-body poses and base velocities over the current and the next\nK\n=\n3\nK=3\ntimesteps; and\n(iii) the previous action\na\nt\n−\n1\na_{t-1}\nto promote temporal smoothness.\nThe action\na\nt\n∈\n𝒜\na_{t}\\in\\mathcal{A}\ncorresponds to target joint positions for the 29-degree-of-freedom Unitree G1 humanoid\n(Unitree,\n2024\n)\n, which are tracked by a low-level PD controller.\nReward Function.\nThe tracking reward\nr\ntrk\nr_{\\mathrm{trk}}\nis designed to encourage accurate imitation of reference boxing motions and is defined as a weighted sum of exponential tracking terms:\nr\ntrk\n​\n(\ns\nt\nself\n,\na\nt\n;\ns\nt\nref\n)\n\\displaystyle r_{\\mathrm{trk}}(s_{t}^{\\mathrm{self}},a_{t};s_{t}^{\\mathrm{ref}})\n=\nw\np\n⋅\nr\np\n​\n(\ns\nt\nself\n,\ns\nt\nref\n)\n+\nw\no\n⋅\nr\no\n​\n(\ns\nt\nself\n,\ns\nt\nref\n)\n+\nw\nbp\n⋅\nr\nbp\n​\n(\ns\nt\nself\n,\ns\nt\nref\n)\n\\displaystyle=w_{\\mathrm{p}}\\cdot r_{\\mathrm{p}}(s^{\\mathrm{self}}_{t},s^{\\mathrm{ref}}_{t})+w_{\\mathrm{o}}\\cdot r_{\\mathrm{o}}(s^{\\mathrm{self}}_{t},s^{\\mathrm{ref}}_{t})+w_{\\mathrm{bp}}\\cdot r_{\\mathrm{bp}}(s^{\\mathrm{self}}_{t},s^{\\mathrm{ref}}_{t})\n+\nw\nbo\n⋅\nr\nbo\n​\n(\ns\nt\nself\n,\ns\nt\nref\n)\n+\nw\nlv\n⋅\nr\nlv\n​\n(\ns\nt\nself\n,\ns\nt\nref\n)\n+\nw\nav\n⋅\nr\nav\n​\n(\ns\nt\nself\n,\ns\nt\nref\n)\n−\nr\nreg\n​\n(\ns\nt\nself\n,\na\nt\n)\n,\n\\displaystyle+w_{\\mathrm{bo}}\\cdot r_{\\mathrm{bo}}(s^{\\mathrm{self}}_{t},s^{\\mathrm{ref}}_{t})+w_{\\mathrm{lv}}\\cdot r_{\\mathrm{lv}}(s^{\\mathrm{self}}_{t},s^{\\mathrm{ref}}_{t})+w_{\\mathrm{av}}\\cdot r_{\\mathrm{av}}(s^{\\mathrm{self}}_{t},s^{\\mathrm{ref}}_{t})-r_{\\mathrm{reg}}(s^{\\mathrm{self}}_{t},a_{t}),\nwhere\n𝒳\n=\np\n,\no\n,\nbp\n,\nbo\n,\nlv\n,\nav\n\\mathcal{X}={\\mathrm{p,o,bp,bo,lv,av}}\nand each term is defined as\nr\nx\n=\nexp\n⁡\n(\n−\n‖\nerr\nx\n‖\n2\n/\nσ\nx\n2\n)\n.\nr_{x}=\\exp(-\\|\\mathrm{err}_{x}\\|^{2}/\\sigma_{x}^{2}).\nHere,\nr\np\nr_{\\mathrm{p}}\nand\nr\no\nr_{\\mathrm{o}}\nmeasure global root position and orientation tracking errors,\nr\nbp\nr_{\\mathrm{bp}}\nand\nr\nbo\nr_{\\mathrm{bo}}\nmeasure relative body link pose errors, and\nr\nlv\nr_{\\mathrm{lv}}\nand\nr\nav\nr_{\\mathrm{av}}\npenalize deviations in linear and angular velocities.

An episode is terminated if any of the following conditions are met: 1).\nPose Collapse:\nThe vertical distance between the robot’s base and its reference height falls below a threshold of\n0.25\n​\nm\n0.25\\,\\text{m}\n, or the base orientation deviation exceeds\n0.8\n0.8\nrad. 2).\nEnd-Effector Violation:\nThe vertical position of key end-effectors, specifically the ankles and wrists, deviates from the reference height by more than\n0.25\n​\nm\n0.25\\,\\text{m}\n. 3).\nTemporal Limit:\nThe maximum episode duration of\n10.0\n10.0\nseconds is reached.\nBy combining structured reward shaping, early termination, and massive-scale parallel simulation in Isaac Lab\n(NVIDIA\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\n, the low-level tracking policy\nπ\ntrk\n\\pi_{\\mathrm{trk}}\nlearns robust and physically consistent motor skills, which form the foundation for subsequent latent skill distillation.\nAppendix B\nEncoding Motion via Topological Latent Distillation\nThis section provides implementation details for the latent motion distillation framework introduced in Section\n3.3\nDistillation Architecture.\nWe adopt a student–teacher paradigm to distill the low-level tracking policy\nπ\ntrk\n\\pi_{\\mathrm{trk}}\ninto a compact latent interface. During training, the teacher policy is fixed, and a student model consisting of an encoder\nE\nϕ\nE_{\\phi}\n, a decoder\nD\nψ\nD_{\\psi}\n, and a state-conditioned prior network\nP\nξ\nP_{\\xi}\nis jointly optimized.\nAt each timestep, the encoder maps privileged observations\no\nt\n=\n(\ns\nt\nself\n,\ns\nt\nref\n)\no_{t}=(s_{t}^{\\mathrm{self}},s_{t}^{\\mathrm{ref}})\nto a latent distribution\nq\nϕ\n​\n(\nz\nt\n∣\no\nt\n)\nq_{\\phi}(z_{t}\\mid o_{t})\n. A latent code\nz\nt\nz_{t}\nis sampled and provided to the decoder, which predicts target joint actions conditioned on the proprioceptive state.\nTraining Objective.\nThe student is trained to reconstruct the teacher’s actions while learning a structured latent distribution. The reconstruction loss is defined as\nℒ\nrec\n=\n𝔼\ns\nt\nref\n∼\nτ\nref\n,\nτ\nref\n∼\n𝒟\nmotion\n​\n[\n‖\na\nt\n−\na\n^\nt\n‖\n2\n]\n,\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{rec}}=\\mathbb{E}_{s^{\\mathrm{ref}}_{t}\\sim\\tau^{\\mathrm{ref}},\\tau^{\\mathrm{ref}}\\sim\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{motion}}}\\left[\\|a_{t}-\\hat{a}_{t}\\|^{2}\\right],\nwhere\na\nt\n∼\nπ\ntrk\n(\n⋅\n∣\no\nt\n)\na_{t}\\sim\\pi_{\\mathrm{trk}}(\\cdot\\mid o_{t})\n,\nz\nt\n∼\nE\nϕ\n(\n⋅\n∣\no\nt\n)\nz_{t}\\sim E_{\\phi}(\\cdot\\mid o_{t})\n,\na\n^\nt\n∼\nD\nψ\n​\n(\ns\nt\nprop\n,\nz\nt\n)\n\\hat{a}_{t}\\sim D_{\\psi}(s_{t}^{\\mathrm{prop}},z_{t})\n. To regularize the latent space, we impose a KL divergence between the encoder posterior and the state-conditioned prior:\nℒ\nprior\n=\n𝔼\ns\nt\nref\n∼\nτ\nref\n,\nτ\nref\n∼\n𝒟\nmotion\n[\nD\nKL\n(\nE\nϕ\n(\nz\nt\n∣\no\nt\n)\n∥\nP\nξ\n(\nz\nt\n∣\ns\nt\nprop\n)\n)\n]\n.\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{prior}}=\\mathbb{E}_{s^{\\mathrm{ref}}_{t}\\sim\\tau^{\\mathrm{ref}},\\tau^{\\mathrm{ref}}\\sim\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{motion}}}\\left[D_{\\mathrm{KL}}\\left(E_{\\phi}(z_{t}\\mid o_{t})\\|P_{\\xi}(z_{t}\\mid s_{t}^{\\mathrm{prop}})\\right)\\right].\nThe prior loss ensures that the prior network captures the semantic structure of the motion primitives. During the competitive stage in self-play, this learned prior provides a critical reference for the high-level policy, where a KL penalty is applied to prevent the strategy from deviating into physically unstable regions of the action space.\nThe total loss is given by\nℒ\ndistill\n=\nℒ\nrec\n+\nλ\nprior\n​\nℒ\nprior\n.\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{distill}}=\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{rec}}+\\lambda_{\\mathrm{prior}}\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{prior}}.\nwhere\nλ\np\n​\nr\n​\ni\n​\no\n​\nr\n=\n0.001\n\\lambda_{prior}=0.001\n. This dual optimization ensures that the student not only recovers the motor control expertise of the teacher but also constructs a structured, prior-conditioned manifold ready for competitive co-evolution.\nAppendix C\nBehavioral Warmup with Adversarial Priors\nThis section gives implementation details for the behavioral wamup training. We also describe how Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP) are incorporated to regularize behaviors toward the motion-capture distribution and preserve human-like boxing style.\nC.1\nGoal-Oriented Observation for Autonomous Boxing\nDifferent from previous tracking-based task settings, the observation of the autonomous boxing task does not contain any explicit motion commands. Instead, the residual policy\nπ\nθ\n\\pi_{\\theta}\nrelies on goal-oriented spatial information to guide decision-making. The task observation\ns\ngoal\ns^{\\mathrm{goal}}\nconsists of two complementary components: (1) offensive target information and (2) defensive threat information.\nOffensive Target Observation.\nThe offensive target observation encodes the relative positions of the ego agent’s left and right fists with respect to the opponent’s torso, represented in the ego-centric coordinate frame. Let\n𝐩\nl\nego\n,\n𝐩\nr\nego\n∈\nℝ\n3\n\\mathbf{p}_{l}^{\\mathrm{ego}},\\mathbf{p}_{r}^{\\mathrm{ego}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}\ndenote the world-frame positions of the ego agent’s wrists,\n𝐩\nt\nopp\n∈\nℝ\n3\n\\mathbf{p}_{t}^{\\mathrm{opp}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}\nthe position of the opponent’s torso, and\n𝐪\nego\n\\mathbf{q}^{\\mathrm{ego}}\nthe ego root orientation. The relative vectors are defined as\n𝐯\nl\noff\n=\n𝐩\nl\nego\n−\n𝐩\nt\nopp\n,\n𝐯\nr\noff\n=\n𝐩\nr\nego\n−\n𝐩\nt\nopp\n,\n\\mathbf{v}_{l}^{\\mathrm{off}}=\\mathbf{p}_{l}^{\\mathrm{ego}}-\\mathbf{p}_{t}^{\\mathrm{opp}},\\quad\\mathbf{v}_{r}^{\\mathrm{off}}=\\mathbf{p}_{r}^{\\mathrm{ego}}-\\mathbf{p}_{t}^{\\mathrm{opp}},\n(14)\nwhich are further transformed into the ego-centric frame via\n𝐯\n~\noff\n=\n𝐑\n​\n(\n𝐪\nego\n)\n−\n1\n​\n𝐫\noff\n,\n\\tilde{\\mathbf{v}}^{\\mathrm{off}}=\\mathbf{R}(\\mathbf{q}^{\\mathrm{ego}})^{-1}\\mathbf{r}^{\\mathrm{off}},\n(15)\nwhere\n𝐑\n​\n(\n⋅\n)\n\\mathbf{R}(\\cdot)\ndenotes the rotation matrix induced by the quaternion.\nThis transformation removes global orientation dependency and ensures rotational invariance of the observation. As a result, the offensive component provides direct and physically interpretable geometric information for guiding accurate, distance-aware striking behaviors.\nDefensive Target Observation.\nThe defensive target observation characterizes the relative positions of the opponent’s left and right fists with respect to the ego agent’s torso, also expressed in the ego-centric frame. Let\n𝐩\nl\nopp\n,\n𝐩\nr\nopp\n∈\nℝ\n3\n\\mathbf{p}_{l}^{\\mathrm{opp}},\\mathbf{p}_{r}^{\\mathrm{opp}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}\ndenote the opponent’s wrist positions and\n𝐩\nt\nego\n∈\nℝ\n3\n\\mathbf{p}_{t}^{\\mathrm{ego}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}\nthe ego torso position. The defensive vectors are computed as\n𝐯\nl\ndef\n=\n𝐩\nl\nopp\n−\n𝐩\nt\nego\n,\n𝐯\nr\ndef\n=\n𝐩\nr\nopp\n−\n𝐩\nt\nego\n,\n\\mathbf{v}_{l}^{\\mathrm{def}}=\\mathbf{p}_{l}^{\\mathrm{opp}}-\\mathbf{p}_{t}^{\\mathrm{ego}},\\quad\\mathbf{v}_{r}^{\\mathrm{def}}=\\mathbf{p}_{r}^{\\mathrm{opp}}-\\mathbf{p}_{t}^{\\mathrm{ego}},\n(16)\nand rotated into the local frame in the same manner:\n𝐯\n~\ndef\n=\n𝐑\n​\n(\n𝐪\nego\n)\n−\n1\n​\n𝐯\ndef\n.\n\\tilde{\\mathbf{v}}^{\\mathrm{def}}=\\mathbf{R}(\\mathbf{q}^{\\mathrm{ego}})^{-1}\\mathbf{v}^{\\mathrm{def}}.\n(17)\nThis component enables the policy to perceive incoming attack trajectories independently of global pose, facilitating anticipatory defense, evasive maneuvers, and counter-attacking strategies.\nTogether, the offensive and defensive observations form a compact yet expressive goal representation\ns\ngoal\n=\n(\n𝐯\n~\nl\noff\n,\n𝐯\n~\nr\noff\n,\n𝐯\n~\nl\ndef\n,\n𝐯\n~\nr\ndef\n)\ns^{\\mathrm{goal}}=(\\tilde{\\mathbf{v}}^{\\mathrm{off}}_{l},\\tilde{\\mathbf{v}}^{\\mathrm{off}}_{r},\\tilde{\\mathbf{v}}^{\\mathrm{def}}_{l},\\tilde{\\mathbf{v}}^{\\mathrm{def}}_{r})\nthat supports coordinated attack–defense behaviors in autonomous humanoid boxing.\nC.2\nAdversarial Motion Prior\nTo preserve human-like motion quality, we follow\n(Peng\net al.\n,\n2018\n)\nto use a discriminator\nC\nC\nto distinguish whether the state originates from mocap dataset\n𝒟\nmotion\n\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{motion}}\nor the agent formed by the policy\nπ\nz\n\\pi_{z}\nand the frozen decoder\nD\nψ\nD_{\\psi}\n. Specifically, we first construct the AMP observation\no\nt\ndisc\n{o_{t}}^{\\mathrm{disc}}\nto better capture the style of the mocap data. The observation\no\nt\ndisc\n{o_{t}}^{{\\mathrm{disc}}}\nincludes the local rotation and velocity of each joint, along with the angular velocities of the base. Observation transitions from the agent and those sampled from the mocap data are fed separately to the discriminator. We label the transitions from the mocap data as\nreal\nand those from the agent as\nfake\n. The goal of the discriminator is to classify these inputs correctly: when mocap transitions are provided, the output should approach 1, whereas transitions from the agent should produce outputs closer to -1. As a result, the objective function can be formulated as follows:\narg\n⁡\nmin\nC\n\\displaystyle\\arg\\min_{C}\n𝔼\nd\n𝒟\nmotion\n​\n(\no\nt\ndisc\n,\no\nt\n+\n1\ndisc\n)\n​\n[\n(\nC\n​\n(\no\nt\ndisc\n,\no\nt\n+\n1\ndisc\n)\n−\n1\n)\n2\n]\n\\displaystyle\\ \\mathbb{E}_{d^{\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{motion}}}({o_{t}}^{\\mathrm{disc}},{o_{t+1}^{\\mathrm{disc}}})}\\left[\\left(C({o_{t}}^{\\mathrm{disc}},{o_{t+1}^{\\mathrm{disc}}})-1\\right)^{2}\\right]\n+\n𝔼\nd\nπ\nz\n,\nD\nψ\n​\n(\no\nt\ndisc\n,\no\nt\n+\n1\ndisc\n)\n​\n[\n(\nC\n​\n(\no\nt\ndisc\n,\no\nt\n+\n1\ndisc\n)\n+\n1\n)\n2\n]\n.\n\\displaystyle+\\mathbb{E}_{d^{\\pi_{z},D_{\\psi}}({o_{t}}^{\\mathrm{disc}},{o_{t+1}^{\\mathrm{disc}}})}\\left[\\left(C({o_{t}}^{\\mathrm{disc}},{o_{t+1}^{\\mathrm{disc}}})+1\\right)^{2}\\right].\nSince discriminators often suffer from mode collapse, we follow AMP\n(Peng\net al.\n,\n2018\n)\nby applying a gradient penalty to the mocap data transitions to ensure stability.

To address this issue, we design an offensive punch hit reward that jointly considers kinematic intent, geometric alignment, and physical contact.\nLet\n𝐯\nw\ni\n\\mathbf{v}_{w_{i}}\nbe the velocity of wrist\ni\ni\nand\n𝐯\nt\n\\mathbf{v}_{t}\nbe the velocity of the torso link.

Subsequently, the task reward weight\nw\ntask\nw_{\\mathrm{task}}\nis phased in, allowing the agent to optimize strike precision while adhering to the geometric and stylistic constraints imposed by the learned manifold and the AMP prior.\nAppendix D\nLatent-Space Neural Fictitious Self-Play\nThis section includes the pseudo code in Algorithm\n1\nand the training details of LS-NFSP.\nAlgorithm 1\nLatent-Space Neural Fictitious Self-Play (LS-NFSP)\n0:\nTwo-player zero-sum game environment\nℳ\n\\mathcal{M}\n, anticipatory parameter\nη\n∈\n[\n0\n,\n1\n]\n\\eta\\in[0,1]\n, horizon\nT\nT\n0:\nBest-response (RL) policies\n{\nπ\nz\n,\nθ\ni\nRL\n}\ni\n∈\n{\n1\n,\n2\n}\n\\{\\pi^{\\mathrm{RL}}_{z,\\theta_{i}}\\}_{i\\in\\{1,2\\}}\n, average policies\n{\nπ\n¯\nz\n,\nϕ\ni\n}\ni\n∈\n{\n1\n,\n2\n}\n\\{\\bar{\\pi}_{z,\\phi_{i}}\\}_{i\\in\\{1,2\\}}\n0:\nOn-policy rollout buffers\n{\n𝒟\nRL\ni\n}\ni\n∈\n{\n1\n,\n2\n}\n\\{\\mathcal{D}^{i}_{\\mathrm{RL}}\\}_{i\\in\\{1,2\\}}\n, reservoir buffers\n{\n𝒟\nSL\ni\n}\ni\n∈\n{\n1\n,\n2\n}\n\\{\\mathcal{D}^{i}_{\\mathrm{SL}}\\}_{i\\in\\{1,2\\}}\n1:\nfor\niteration\nk\n=\n1\n,\n2\n,\n…\nk=1,2,\\dots\ndo\n2:\nReset\nℳ\n\\mathcal{M}\nand observe\no\n1\n1\n,\no\n1\n2\no_{1}^{1},o_{1}^{2}\n{\no\nt\ni\no_{t}^{i}\ncan include\n(\ns\nt\nprop\n,\ni\n,\ns\nt\ngoal\n,\ni\n)\n(s_{t}^{\\mathrm{prop},i},s_{t}^{\\mathrm{goal},i})\n}\n3:\nfor\nt\n=\n1\n,\n2\n,\n…\n,\nT\nt=1,2,\\dots,T\ndo\n4:\nfor all\nplayers\ni\n∈\n{\n1\n,\n2\n}\ni\\in\\{1,2\\}\ndo\n5:\nSample mode\nm\ni\n∼\nBernoulli\n​\n(\nη\n)\nm_{i}\\sim\\mathrm{Bernoulli}(\\eta)\n{\nm\ni\n=\n1\nm_{i}{=}1\n: best-response;\nm\ni\n=\n0\nm_{i}{=}0\n: average}\n6:\nif\nm\ni\n=\n1\nm_{i}=1\nthen\n7:\nSample latent action\nz\nt\ni\n∼\nπ\nz\n,\nθ\ni\nRL\n(\n⋅\n∣\no\nt\ni\n)\nz_{t}^{i}\\sim\\pi^{\\mathrm{RL}}_{z,\\theta_{i}}(\\cdot\\mid o_{t}^{i})\n8:\nInsert\n(\no\nt\ni\n,\nz\nt\ni\n)\n(o_{t}^{i},z_{t}^{i})\ninto\n𝒟\nSL\ni\n\\mathcal{D}^{i}_{\\mathrm{SL}}\nvia reservoir sampling\n9:\nelse\n10:\nSample latent action\nz\nt\ni\n∼\nπ\n¯\nz\n,\nϕ\ni\n(\n⋅\n∣\no\nt\ni\n)\nz_{t}^{i}\\sim\\bar{\\pi}_{z,\\phi_{i}}(\\cdot\\mid o_{t}^{i})\n11:\nend\nif\n12:\nend\nfor\n13:\nStep environment with joint latent action\n(\nz\nt\n1\n,\nz\nt\n2\n)\n(z_{t}^{1},z_{t}^{2})\n; receive rewards\n(\nr\nt\n1\n,\nr\nt\n2\n)\n(r_{t}^{1},r_{t}^{2})\nand next obs\n(\no\nt\n+\n1\n1\n,\no\nt\n+\n1\n2\n)\n(o_{t+1}^{1},o_{t+1}^{2})\n14:\nfor all\nplayers\ni\n∈\n{\n1\n,\n2\n}\ni\\in\\{1,2\\}\ndo\n15:\nAppend transition\n(\no\nt\ni\n,\nz\nt\ni\n,\nr\nt\ni\n,\no\nt\n+\n1\ni\n)\n(o_{t}^{i},z_{t}^{i},r_{t}^{i},o_{t+1}^{i})\nto\n𝒟\nRL\ni\n\\mathcal{D}^{i}_{\\mathrm{RL}}\n16:\nend\nfor\n17:\nend\nfor\n18:\nfor all\nplayers\ni\n∈\n{\n1\n,\n2\n}\ni\\in\\{1,2\\}\ndo\n19:\nUpdate\nθ\ni\n\\theta_{i}\nwith PPO on\n𝒟\nRL\ni\n\\mathcal{D}^{i}_{\\mathrm{RL}}\n20:\nUpdate\nϕ\ni\n\\phi_{i}\nby minimizing\nℒ\nSL\n=\n𝔼\n(\no\n,\nz\n)\n∼\n𝒟\nSL\ni\n​\n[\n‖\nπ\n¯\nz\n,\nϕ\ni\n​\n(\no\n)\n−\nz\n‖\n2\n]\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{SL}}=\\mathbb{E}_{(o,z)\\sim\\mathcal{D}^{i}_{\\mathrm{SL}}}\\big[\\|\\bar{\\pi}_{z,\\phi_{i}}(o)-z\\|^{2}\\big]\n21:\nend\nfor\n22:\nend\nfor\n23:\nreturn\nAverage policies\n{\nπ\n¯\nz\n,\nϕ\ni\n}\ni\n∈\n{\n1\n,\n2\n}\n\\{\\bar{\\pi}_{z,\\phi_{i}}\\}_{i\\in\\{1,2\\}}\nD.1\nDual-Policy Architecture.\nTo implement fictitious play, each agent maintains a dual-policy system. This system includes a best response policy (\nπ\nz\nR\n​\nL\n\\pi_{z}^{RL}\n) and a average policy (\nπ\n¯\nz\n\\bar{\\pi}_{z}\n). The best response policy (\nπ\nz\nR\n​\nL\n\\pi_{z}^{RL}\n) is an on-policy actor optimized via PPO\n(Schulman\net al.\n,\n2017\n)\nto exploit the opponent’s current average strategy. The average policy (\nπ\n¯\nz\n\\bar{\\pi}_{z}\n) is a supervised learning network that approximates the agent’s historical distribution of best-response behaviors, acting as a stable strategic anchor.\nD.2\nReservoir-Based Strategy Buffer.\nTo ensure that the average policy represents a uniform sampling of the agent’s behavioral history, we utilize a reservoir sampling mechanism. Each agent stores its latent-space trajectories\n(\ns\nt\nprop\n,\ns\nt\ngoal\n,\nz\nt\n)\n(s_{t}^{\\mathrm{prop}},s_{t}^{\\mathrm{goal}},z_{t})\nin a buffer\n𝒟\nS\n​\nL\n\\mathcal{D}_{SL}\nof capacity\nK\nK\n.

The simulated Unitree G1 humanoid\n(Unitree,\n2024\n)\nutilizes 29 degrees of freedom, with the physics engine operating at 200 Hz and the control policy at 50 Hz. Strategic co-evolution is conducted over a 32-dimensional latent manifold.\nMulti-agent Training.\nIn the final self-play stage, the LS-NFSP is configured with an exploration parameter\nη\n=\n0.1\n\\eta=0.1\nand a strategy reservoir capacity of\nK\n=\n10\n6\nK=10^{6}\nsamples per agent. The reward function balances performance and style with a task reward weight\nw\ntask\nw_{\\text{task}}\nof\n0.8\n0.8\nand an AMP style reward weight\nw\nstyle\nw_{\\text{style}}\nof\n0.2\n0.2\n, while the prior loss coefficient\nλ\nprior\n\\lambda_{\\text{prior}}\nis set to\n0.001\n0.001\n. Training is executed on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU, incorporating domain randomization across friction, mass, and actuator gains to ensure robust tactical emergence.\nTo evaluate the tactical progression and physical performance of the LS-NFSP framework, we define a comprehensive set of metrics across three primary dimensions: tactical proficiency, physical stability, and stylistic authenticity. Win Rate (\nW\n​\nR\nWR\n) is defined as the percentage of matches won over a series of 20 evaluation bouts, where a match is lost by the agent that first contacts the ground with any body part other than the feet, thereby triggering a fall-based termination. To quantify offensive precision, we define Hit Efficiency (\nη\nh\n​\ni\n​\nt\n\\eta_{hit}\n) as the ratio of successful strikes, which is identified by the proportion of contacts exceeding the force threshold\nF\nt\n​\nh\n=\n10\n​\nN\nF_{th}=10N\nto the total number of offensive attempts. Furthermore, the Engagement Rate (\nE\n​\nR\nER\n) evaluates the strategic positioning and operational persistence of an agent. It is calculated as the proportion of the episode duration in which the agent concurrently satisfies two spatial conditions: maintaining a distance\nd\nt\nd_{t}\nwithin the effective striking range\n[\n0.5\n,\n1.2\n]\n[0.5,1.2]\nand ensuring a facing alignment\ncos\n⁡\n(\nθ\nt\n)\n\\cos(\\theta_{t})\nthat exceeds a predefined threshold\nτ\nf\n​\na\n​\nc\n​\ne\n=\n0.9\n\\tau_{face}=0.9\n. This metric provides a rigorous measure of an agent’s ability to maintain a viable combat posture, effectively penalizing tactical avoidance or non-confrontational movement\npatterns.\nPhysical stability is assessed through Base Orientation Stability (\n𝒪\nb\n​\na\n​\ns\n​\ne\n\\mathcal{O}_{base}\n) and Torque Smoothness (\n𝒮\nτ\n\\mathcal{S}_{\\tau}\n). To ensure a positive correlation with control quality,\n𝒪\nb\n​\na\n​\ns\n​\ne\n\\mathcal{O}_{base}\nis defined using an exponential kernels on the angular deviation:\n𝒪\nb\n​\na\n​\ns\n​\ne\n=\n𝔼\n​\n[\nexp\n⁡\n(\n−\n‖\n𝐠\nb\n​\na\n​\ns\n​\ne\n−\n𝐠\nw\n​\no\n​\nr\n​\nl\n​\nd\n‖\n2\n)\n]\n\\mathcal{O}_{base}=\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(-\\|\\mathbf{g}_{base}-\\mathbf{g}_{world}\\|^{2})]\n, where\n𝐠\nb\n​\na\n​\ns\n​\ne\n\\mathbf{g}_{base}\nand\n𝐠\nw\n​\no\n​\nr\n​\nl\n​\nd\n\\mathbf{g}_{world}\nrepresent the gravity vector in the robot’s local frame and the global frame, respectively. A higher\n𝒪\nb\n​\na\n​\ns\n​\ne\n\\mathcal{O}_{base}\nscore indicates a superior ability to maintain an upright posture under competitve perturbations. Torque Smoothness (\n𝒮\nτ\n\\mathcal{S}_{\\tau}\n) measures the magnitude of high-frequency oscillations in motor commands, calculated as the mean absolute change in joint torques across consecutive control steps:\n𝒮\nτ\n=\n𝔼\n​\n[\n‖\nτ\nt\n−\nτ\nt\n−\n1\n‖\n]\n\\mathcal{S}_{\\tau}=\\mathbb{E}[\\|\\tau_{t}-\\tau_{t-1}\\|]\n. A lower\n𝒮\nτ\n\\mathcal{S}_{\\tau}\nvalue represents more hardware-friendly execution and reduced mechanical wear. Finally, the Stylistic Authenticity of the emergent behaviors is evaluated via qualitative visual inspection. Instead of relying on a singular numerical score, we provide a comparative analysis of simulation snapshots to assess the human-likeness of the motions. This includes identifying key boxing maneuvers such as slips, counters, and rhythmic footwork, while ensuring the absence of unnatural joint configurations or physically unsustainable postures that often characterize non-constrained reinforcement learning policies.\nF.1\nBaselines\nWe compare LS-NFSP against a set of baselines that isolate the contributions of (i) NFSP-style opponent averaging, (ii) the latent strategy manifold, (iii) curriculum warmup, and (iv) stylistic regularization.\n•\nNaive Self-Play (Naive SP).\nA standard self-play baseline\n(Samuel,\n1959\n; Hernandez\net al.\n,\n2019\n)\ntrained in the same latent action space as ours, where each agent always plays against the opponent’s latest policy snapshot (no opponent averaging).\n•\nFictitious Self-Play (Fictitious SP).\nA latent-space self-play baseline inspired by fictitious play\n(Brown,\n1951\n)\n, where agents are trained by sampling opponents uniformly from a population of historical policies. Unlike LS-NFSP, it does not maintain an explicit learned average policy network.\n•\nLS-NFSP w/o AMP.\nAn ablation of our method where the Adversarial Motion Prior (AMP) style reward\n(Peng\net al.\n,\n2021\n)\nis removed during training, testing the importance of motion-style regularization for physically plausible and effective strikes.\n•\nPPO-Only.\nA non-competitive baseline trained with PPO\n(Schulman\net al.\n,\n2017\n)\nagainst a fixed opponent (no self-play). This tests whether competitive co-evolution is necessary to induce robust tactics.\n•\nStatic-Target Specialist.\nThe policy after the warmup stage (trained to strike a passive sandbag) deployed without further competitive training. This measures how much performance comes from single-agent skill acquisition alone.\n•\nSelf-Play w/o Warmup (SP w/o Warmup).\nA curriculum ablation where self-play starts from scratch without the sandbag warmup, testing learning stability under sparse and non-stationary competitive signals.\n•\n29-DoF Action-Space Self-Play (29Dof Action-Space SP).\nA baseline that performs self-play directly in the 29-DoF joint target space (i.e., without the learned latent manifold), highlighting the instability of competitive learning in raw motor command space.",
    "preview_text": "Achieving human-level competitive intelligence and physical agility in humanoid robots remains a major challenge, particularly in contact-rich and highly dynamic tasks such as boxing. While Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a principled framework for strategic interaction, its direct application to humanoid control is hindered by high-dimensional contact dynamics and the absence of strong physical motion priors. We propose RoboStriker, a hierarchical three-stage framework that enables fully autonomous humanoid boxing by decoupling high-level strategic reasoning from low-level physical execution. The framework first learns a comprehensive repertoire of boxing skills by training a single-agent motion tracker on human motion capture data. These skills are subsequently distilled into a structured latent manifold, regularized by projecting the Gaussian-parameterized distribution onto a unit hypersphere. This topological constraint effectively confines exploration to the subspace of physically plausible motions. In the final stage, we introduce Latent-Space Neural Fictitious Self-Play (LS-NFSP), where competing agents learn competitive tactics by interacting within the latent action space rather than the raw motor space, significantly stabilizing multi-agent training. Experimental results demonstrate that RoboStriker achieves superior competitive performance in simulation and exhibits sim-to-real transfer.

            "answer": "## 论文核心分析：RoboStriker\n\n### **一、 核心问题**\n论文旨在解决**具身多智能体强化学习（Embodied MARL）** 在**高动态、接触丰富的竞争性任务**（如人形机器人拳击）中面临的两个根本性矛盾：\n1.  **物理可行性与非平稳学习的矛盾**：人形机器人控制受限于高维连续动作空间和严格的物理约束（如平衡、关节极限）。有效的策略探索需要多样甚至激进的行为，但这极易导致物理上无效的动作（如摔倒），而过度保守的控制器又会扼杀策略学习。\n2.  **策略演化与系统稳定性的矛盾**：通过自我对弈（self-play）的MARL依赖于对手策略的持续演化，这引入了严重的非平稳性。虽然这对发现竞争性策略至关重要，但人形系统动态脆弱，对手行为的微小分布偏移都可能导致平衡和接触失稳，引发训练崩溃。\n\n### **二、 核心创新点**\n论文提出了一个名为 **RoboStriker** 的**分层三阶段框架**，其核心创新在于**将高层策略推理与底层物理执行解耦**，并通过一个**结构化的潜在动作空间**来桥接二者。\n\n1.  **分层决策架构**：\n    - **阶段一（技能库）**：基于人类动作捕捉数据，训练一个通用的运动跟踪策略（`DeepMimic`风格），掌握一套**物理上可行的**拳击基础技能（如出拳、移动、防守）。\n    - **阶段二（结构化潜在空间）**：将学到的技能**蒸馏**到一个**有界的连续潜在空间**。关键创新在于对该空间施加**拓扑正则化**（投影到单位超球面 `𝕊^(d-1)`），从而将策略探索限制在物理合理的运动子空间内。\n    - **阶段三（竞争性学习）**：在潜在空间中引入 **“潜在空间神经虚拟自我对弈”**。\n\n2.  **Latent-Space Neural Fictitious Self-Play (LS-NFSP)**：\n    - 这是论文的**核心算法创新**。它将经典的NFSP（一种用于求解博弈均衡的算法）**移植到结构化潜在空间**中执行。\n    - **优势**：智能体在紧凑、物理安全的潜在动作空间中学习竞争策略，而非原始的高维电机指令空间。这**极大地稳定了多智能体训练**，避免了因策略剧烈变化导致的物理失稳，并使学习动态更符合博弈论收敛理论。\n\n3.  **行为预热与对抗性运动先验**：\n    - 在进入完全竞争学习前，引入一个**行为预热阶段**，让智能体先学习攻击静止目标的基本能力。\n    - 使用**对抗性运动先验** 来正则化智能体的动作风格，确保其行为在追求战术目标的同时，保持**类人的、自然的运动形态**，避免出现怪异、无效的动作模式。\n\n### **三、 解决方案路径**\n**“物理执行与策略推理解耦 + 潜在空间约束下的博弈学习”**\n\n1.  **解决物理可行性矛盾**：\n    - **解耦**：底层由预训练且固定的运动解码器负责，它**只产生物理可行的动作**。\n    - **约束**：高层策略在**有界的潜在空间**中输出指令，这个空间本身由物理合理的技能蒸馏而来。这相当于为策略探索设置了“安全围栏”。\n\n2.  **解决策略稳定性矛盾**：\n    - **稳定空间**：LS-NFSP在**紧凑的潜在策略空间**中运行，策略更新引起的分布变化幅度受到天然限制。\n    - **稳定算法**：NFSP机制通过维护和混合**平均策略** 与**最优反应策略**，平滑了自我对弈中的非平稳性，引导学习趋向博弈均衡，而非策略循环振荡。\n\n### **四、 实际价值与验证**\n- **性能验证**：在仿真和Unitree G1实体机器人上进行了验证，实现了**仿真到现实的零样本迁移**。实验显示，RoboStriker在交叉对弈中胜率显著高于所有基线（见表1），并展现出更高的打击命中率（`η_hit = 0.685`）和身体稳定性（`BOS = 0.942`）。\n- **通用性贡献**：为解决**具身多智能体竞争**这一普遍难题提供了一个通用框架模板：**技能模仿 → 潜在空间蒸馏 → 约束空间内的博弈学习**。\n- **技术贡献**：首次在具身MARL领域形式化阐述了上述两大矛盾，并给出了一个结合**模仿学习、表征学习、博弈论与强化学习**的综合性解决方案。\n\n**总结**：RoboStriker的核心创新不是单一算法，而是一个**系统性的工程与算法框架**。它通过引入一个**物理接地、拓扑约束的潜在动作空间**作为“战略沙盘”，成功地将适用于抽象博弈的先进多智能体算法（NFSP）安全、有效地应用于高维、脆弱的物理人形机器人控制问题中，实现了动态、鲁棒且具战术性的自主拳击行为。",

            "answer": "## 论文《RoboStriker: Hierarchical Decision-Making for Autonomous Humanoid Boxing》技术脉络与发展方向分析\n\n基于论文内容及其引用的相关文献，可以梳理出**人形机器人具身智能与竞技控制**这一方向的发展脉络。其核心演进逻辑是：**从单智能体、被动的运动模仿与控制，逐步迈向多智能体、主动的、具备战略交互能力的具身竞技**。每一步的改进都旨在解决更复杂环境下的新矛盾。\n\n以下是该方向的整体发展脉络，按几个关键发展方向进行梳理：\n\n### 发展方向一：从运动模仿到通用运动控制（单智能体基础）\n\n这个方向的核心目标是让机器人能够稳定、逼真地执行复杂的人类动作，为高级任务奠定物理基础。\n\n1.  **早期运动合成与重定向 (Kinematic Motion Synthesis)**\n    *   **代表工作**：基于逆向运动学(IK)和时空优化的运动捕捉数据重定向方法 (Gleicher, 1998; Yamane et al., 2004)。\n    *   **改进与局限**：实现了动作的几何复现，但**缺乏动力学考量**，在物理仿真中易出现“脚滑”等违反物理规律的现象，无法直接用于物理控制。\n\n2.  **基于物理的模仿学习 (Physics-based Imitation Learning)**\n    *   **代表工作**：**DeepMimic** (Peng et al., 2018)。\n    *   **核心改进**：引入强化学习，在物理仿真环境中通过奖励函数（如姿态、速度误差）**跟踪参考运动**。解决了运动在物理世界中的**稳定性问题**（如平衡、接触），使模仿的动作物理可行。\n    *   **局限**：主要针对**预定义、固定的运动序列**进行高保真模仿，缺乏对环境的**反应性和适应性**。\n\n3.  **对抗性运动先验与风格化控制 (Adversarial Stylistic Control)**\n    *   **代表工作**：**AMP** (Peng et al., 2021)。\n    *   **核心改进**：引入**判别器**来区分机器人运动与人类运动数据集，提供**风格奖励**。这使得策略不仅能完成目标任务，还能**保持人类动作的“风格”或“自然度”**，大大提升了动作的多样性和拟人性。\n    *   **局限**：仍聚焦于**单智能体**任务，无法处理动态对手带来的非平稳性。\n\n4.  **通用运动跟踪器 (Universal Motion Trackers)**\n    *   **代表工作**：GMT (Chen et al., 2025), Unitracker (Yin et al., 2025) 等。\n    *   **核心改进**：旨在学习一个**统一的策略**，能够跟踪一个**庞大、多样的人类动作库**中的任何动作。这为机器人提供了丰富的“技能库”，是迈向通用控制的关键一步。\n    *   **RoboStriker的定位与改进**：本文的**第一阶段（运动跟踪器）** 直接建立在此类工作之上。但其目标不仅是模仿，更是为后续的**多智能体竞技**提供一个稳定、可靠的底层执行器。它将这些通用技能作为**高层战略演化的物理基础**。\n\n### 发展方向二：从原始动作空间到结构化潜空间（技能抽象与表示）\n\n这个方向旨在解决高维连续动作空间带来的探索困难和训练不稳定问题，通过抽象来简化控制。\n\n1.  **技能潜表示学习 (Skill-based Latent Representation Learning)**\n    *   **代表工作**：**PULSE** (Luo et al., 2023), **CALM** (Tessler et al., 2023)。\n    *   **核心改进**：将庞大的运动数据集**蒸馏**到一个低维的**连续潜空间**中。高层策略只需在这个潜空间中输出潜变量，再由解码器生成复杂的关节动作。这**极大地简化了高层策略的搜索空间**，实现了“技能”的模块化调用。\n    *   **局限**：通常将潜空间建模为**无界的欧几里得空间**，高层策略的探索仍可能产生分布外的潜动作，导致底层控制器执行出物理上无效甚至崩溃的动作。\n\n2.  **RoboStriker的拓扑潜空间蒸馏**\n    *   **核心改进（第二阶段）**：\n        *   **有界化**：通过将高斯参数化的潜分布**投影到单位超球面** (`Normalize(z) = z / ||z||_2`)，将潜空间约束为一个**紧致的拓扑流形** (`𝒵 = 𝕊^{d-1}`)。\n        *   **理论意义**：这确保了策略搜索被限制在**物理可信的运动子空间**内，从根本上防止了高层策略产生导致物理不稳定的动作。这为后续的多智能体博弈提供了**紧凑且安全的策略集**。\n        *   **实际价值**：这是本文解决 **“物理可行性 vs. 非平稳学习”** 矛盾的关键技术之一。它将战略探索与动力学不稳定性**解耦**。\n\n### 发展方向三：从单智能体到多智能体竞技战略（博弈与协同演化）\n\n这个方向将博弈论和多智能体强化学习引入具身控制，以产生具有战略交互能力的智能体。\n\n1.  **抽象领域的多智能体强化学习与自我博弈**\n    *   **代表工作**：围棋AlphaGo (Silver et al., 2017)、星际争霸II (Vinyals et al., 2019)、**神经虚拟自我博弈 (NFSP)** (Heinrich and Silver, 2016)。\n    *   **核心改进**：在信息完全或不完全博弈中，通过**自我博弈**和**虚拟博弈**等机制，让智能体在与对手的持续对抗中**协同进化**，最终达到纳什均衡或掌握高超策略。\n    *   **局限**：这些方法应用于**抽象或弱具身环境**（如棋盘、游戏界面），其动作空间是离散或低维连续的，**缺乏对高维、接触丰富的物理动力学和物理可行性的归纳偏置**。直接应用于人形机器人会导致训练崩溃。\n\n2.  **RoboStriker的潜空间神经虚拟自我博弈 (LS-NFSP)**\n    *   **核心改进（第三阶段）**：\n        *   **空间迁移**：将NFSP的核心思想（维护最佳响应策略和平均策略）**从原始动作空间迁移到第二阶段构建的有界潜空间**中进行。\n        *   **稳定化机制**：\n            *   **行为预热**：在正式对抗前，让智能体先与静止目标（沙袋）训练，学习基本的进攻技能，解决 **“竞争冷启动”** 问题。\n            *   **AMP正则化**：在预热和LS-NFSP阶段持续使用AMP奖励，确保演化出的战术动作**保持人类风格和物理合理性**。\n        *   **理论保障**：由于潜空间是**紧致**的，根据博弈论（如Glicksberg定理），**混合策略纳什均衡的存在性得到保证**。论文证明了LS-NFSP能在该诱导博弈中收敛到一个**近似纳什均衡**。\n        *   **实际价值**：这是本文解决 **“战略演化 vs. 系统稳定性”** 矛盾的核心。它在**不破坏物理稳定性的前提下**，允许战略在安全的潜空间内充分探索和对抗，从而涌现出复杂的拳击战术（如滑步、反击）。\n\n### 总结：RoboStriker的集成创新与贡献\n\n| 发展阶段 | 核心问题 | 代表性技术 | RoboStriker的改进与整合 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **1. 单智能体运动控制** | 如何生成物理可行、自然的人形运动？ | DeepMimic (模仿), AMP (风格化) | **继承并作为基石**：第一阶段训练通用运动跟踪器，提供物理可行的技能库。 |\n| **2. 技能抽象表示** | 如何简化高层控制，避免物理失效？ | PULSE, CALM (潜空间蒸馏) | **关键改进**：引入**拓扑约束（超球面）**，创建**有界、安全的潜动作空间**，解耦战略与物理。 |\n| **3. 多智能体战略学习** | 如何在物理约束下进行战略对抗与演化？ | NFSP (博弈论MARL) | **核心创新**：提出 **LS-NFSP**，在**有界潜空间**中进行虚拟自我博弈，结合**行为预热**和**AMP正则化**，首次在**高维具身系统**中实现了稳定的战略协同演化。 |\n\n**最终，RoboStriker的创新价值在于：**\n它**不是**对单一方向的改进，而是**首次系统性地识别并解决了具身多智能体强化学习中的两大固有矛盾**，并通过一个**层次化框架**将上述三个发展方向有机融合：\n1.  **底层**：基于模仿学习的**物理可行性**保障。\n2.  **中层**：基于拓扑潜空间蒸馏的**安全策略抽象**。\n3.  **高层**：基于LS-NFSP的**稳定战略演化**。\n\n这个框架为将MARL从抽象游戏成功扩展到复杂的物理具身系统（如竞技、协作作业）提供了一条**原则性的技术路径**，其“仿真到现实”的迁移结果",

            "answer": "## 论文关键技术方法分析\n\n本文《RoboStriker: Hierarchical Decision-Making for Autonomous Humanoid Boxing》提出了一种解决具身多智能体强化学习（MARL）中物理可行性与策略演化矛盾的三层分层框架。其核心创新在于将高层策略推理与底层物理执行解耦，并通过一个结构化的潜在空间来稳定竞争性学习。关键技术方法如下表所示：\n\n| 方法阶段 | 核心组件 | 技术细节与数学原理 | 具体参数与实现 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **第一阶段：专家运动追踪器学习** | **基于DeepMimic的跟踪策略** `π_trk` | **目标**：从人类动作捕捉数据中学习一个鲁棒的低层控制器，生成物理上可行的人形运动库。<br>**数学原理**：<br>1. **状态与观察**：策略输入为 `o_t = (s_t^self, s_t^ref)`，其中 `s_t^self` 为机器人本体感知状态（关节位置、速度等），`s_t^ref` 为从动捕数据 `D_motion` 中采样的参考运动目标状态（姿态、速度）。<br>2. **奖励函数**：最大化跟踪奖励的期望。奖励 `r_trk` 为多个指数型对齐误差的加权和：<br>`r_trk = Σ_{x∈X} w_x · exp(-‖err_x‖² / σ_x²) - r_reg`<br>其中 `X = {p, o, bp, bo, lv, av}` 分别代表根位置、根朝向、身体部位位置、身体部位朝向、线速度、角速度的跟踪误差。`r_reg` 为正则化项，惩罚动作变化率、关节限位和自碰撞。<br>3. **优化目标**：<br>`π_trk* = argmax_{π_trk} E_{s^ref∼τ^ref, τ^ref∼D_motion}[J_{π_trk}(s^ref)]`<br>`J_{π_trk}(s^ref) = E_{a_t∼π_trk}[Σ_{t=0}^T γ^t r_trk(s_t^self, a_t; s^ref)]` | **机器人平台**：Unitree G1 (29自由度)。<br>**动捕数据**：46段专业拳击动作，总计约14分钟，频率50Hz，经左右镜像增强。<br>**奖励权重 (w_x)** 与 **缩放因子 (σ_x)**：<br>- 根位置/朝向: w=0.5, σ=0.3/0.4<br>- 身体位置/朝向: w=1.0, σ=0.3/0.4<br>- 线速度/角速度: w=1.0, σ=1.0/3.14<br>**训练**：在Isaac Lab中使用4096个并行环境。 |\n| **第二阶段：拓扑潜在蒸馏编码** | **有界潜在空间构建** (编码器 `E_φ`, 解码器 `D_ψ`, 先验网络 `P_ξ`) | **目标**：将第一阶段学到的丰富运动技能压缩到一个连续、有界的潜在空间 `Z`，作为高层策略的动作空间。<br>**数学原理**：<br>1. **蒸馏框架**：采用师生架构。编码器将观察 `o_t` 映射为潜在分布 `z_t ∼ E_φ(·|o_t) = N(μ_t^e, σ_t^e)`。解码器根据本体状态 `s_t^prop` 和潜在码 `z_t` 重建教师动作：`â_t ∼ D_ψ(·|s_t^prop, z_t)`。<br>2. **状态条件先验**：学习一个先验网络 `P_ξ(z_t|s_t^prop) = N(z_t|μ_t^p, σ_t^p)`，并通过KL散度约束编码器后验，防止后验坍塌：<br>`(E_φ*, P_ξ*) = argmin_{(E_φ, P_ξ)} D_KL( E_φ(z_t|o_t) ‖ P_ξ(z_t|s_t^prop) )`<br>3. **拓扑约束（关键创新）**：对采样出的潜在码进行归一化，将其约束在单位超球面上：<br>`ẑ = Normalize(z) = E_φ(o) / ‖E_φ(o)‖₂`<br>这使得潜在空间 `Z = 𝕊^{d-1}` 成为一个紧集，确保了策略探索被限制在物理合理的运动子流形内。 | **潜在空间维度**：`d = 32`。<br>**损失函数**：`ℒ_distill = ℒ_rec + λ_prior · ℒ_prior`，其中 `ℒ_rec` 为动作重建的MSE损失，`ℒ_prior` 为上述KL散度损失。<br>**先验损失权重**：`λ_prior = 0.001`。 |\n| **第三阶段：行为预热与潜在空间神经虚拟自博弈** | **3.1 行为预热 (AMP正则化)** | **目标**：在进入激烈对抗前，让智能体先学习针对静止对手的基本攻击技能，解决“竞争冷启动”问题。<br>**数学原理**：<br>1. **残差策略**：高层策略 `π_z` 输出相对于冻结先验 `P_ξ^⊥` 的残差潜在命令 `Δz_t`：<br>`π_z(·|s^prop, s^goal) = π_θ(·|s^goal) ⊕ P_ξ^⊥(·|s^prop)`<br>`z_t = Normalize(Δz_t + z_t^p)`, 其中 `z_t^p ∼ P_ξ^⊥`。<br>2. **对抗运动先验**：引入判别器 `C` 来区分智能体产生的运动过渡 `(o_t^disc, o_{t+1}^disc)` 和动捕数据中的过渡，并给出风格奖励 `r_style`，确保动作自然、类人。<br>3. **混合奖励**：总奖励 `R(s_t, z_t) = w_task · r_task(s_t) + w_style · r_style(s_t, s_{t+1})`。`r_task` 包含面向奖励、速度奖励、距离奖励和命中奖励等。 | **任务观察 `s^goal`**：包含自我拳头到对手躯干的向量（进攻信息）和对手拳头到自我躯干的向量（防御信息），均转换到自我坐标系。<br>**奖励权重**：`w_task` 和 `w_style` 动态调整，初期以 `w_style` 为主，后期增加 `w_task`。<br>**AMP判别器**：使用带梯度惩罚的最小二乘GAN进行训练。 |\n| | **3.2 潜在空间神经虚拟自博弈** | **目标**：在结构化的潜在空间中进行竞争性协同演化，学习高级战术，并收敛到近似纳什均衡。<br>**数学原理**：<br>1. **双策略机制**：每个智能体维护两个策略：<br>   - **最佳响应策略 (RL策略) `π_z^RL`**：使用PPO优化，旨在针对对手当前的平均策略获取最大收益。<br>   - **平均策略 `π̄_z`**：通过监督学习拟合智能体历史最佳响应行为，作为稳定的策略锚。<br>2. **混合动作选择**：每一步，以概率 `η` 选择平均策略的动作，以概率 `1-η` 选择最佳响应策略的动作：<br>`σ = η · π̄_z + (1-η) · π_z^RL`<br>`z_t ∼ σ(·|s_t^prop, s_t^goal)`<br>3. **经验存储与更新**：<br>   - **RL缓冲区 `D_RL`**：存储交互经验 `(o_t, z_t, r_t, o_{t+1})`，用于更新 `π_z^RL`。<br>   - **SL缓冲区 `D_SL`**：采用**蓄水池采样**存储 `π_z^RL` 选出的动作 `(o_t, z_t)`，确保历史经验均匀覆盖，用于通过最小化MSE损失来更新 `π̄_z`：`ℒ_SL = E_{(o,z)∼D_SL}[‖π̄_z(o) - z‖²]`。<br>4. **理论收敛性**：在**假设3.2-3.4**（潜在空间紧致、收益函数有界、最佳响应近似误差有界）下，基于虚拟自博弈的动力学能使经验分布 `(μ̄_T, ν̄_T)` 收敛到诱导零和博弈的一个 `ϵ`-纳什均衡，其中 `ϵ` 随训练轮次 `T` 增加而减小。 | **探索参数**：`η = 0.1`",

            "answer": "## 论文实验数据集、评估指标与性能提升分析\n\n### 一、实验数据集\n论文的实验主要基于以下两类数据：\n\n1.  **人类动作捕捉数据集**\n    *   **来源**：使用Xsens动作捕捉系统，由专业拳击手录制。\n    *   **规模**：包含46个原始动作片段，总时长约14分钟，采样频率为50Hz。\n    *   **内容**：涵盖了广泛的拳击行为，包括进攻性击打、防御性动作、步法和过渡性动作。\n    *   **数据增强**：通过左右镜像处理，使数据量翻倍。\n    *   **处理**：使用广义运动重定向（GMR）框架，将捕捉到的人类动作重定向到Unitree G1人形机器人的形态上，生成物理上可实现的参考轨迹数据集 `𝒟_motion`。\n\n2.  **仿真环境与机器人平台**\n    *   **仿真器**：在NVIDIA Omniverse平台的Isaac Lab中进行大规模并行仿真训练。\n    *   **机器人模型**：使用Unitree G1人形机器人（29个自由度）作为仿真和实物验证平台。\n\n### 二、主要评估指标\n论文从三个维度设计了量化评估指标：\n\n| 维度 | 指标 | 定义与目的 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **战术熟练度** | **进攻命中率 (η_hit) ↑** | 成功击打（接触力超过阈值）次数占总进攻尝试次数的比例。衡量进攻精度。 |\n| | **交战率 (ER) ↑** | 智能体同时满足以下两个条件的时长占比：1) 与对手距离在有效击打范围内；2) 面向对手的角度超过阈值。衡量主动交战和战术站位能力。 |\n| **物理稳定性** | **基础姿态稳定性 (BOS) ↑** | `BOS = 𝔼[exp(-‖𝐠_base - 𝐠_world‖²)]`，其中𝐠为重力向量。衡量在对抗扰动下保持直立姿态的能力，值越高越稳定。 |\n| | **扭矩平滑度 (TS_τ) ↓** | `TS_τ = 𝔼[‖τ_t - τ_(t-1)‖]`，即关节扭矩在连续控制步间的平均绝对变化。衡量控制指令的平滑度，值越低对硬件越友好，机械磨损越小。 |\n| **风格真实性** | **定性视觉评估** | 通过仿真截图对比，评估动作的“人类相似度”，包括观察是否出现滑步、反击、节奏性步法等典型拳击动作，以及是否避免不自然的关节配置。 |\n\n**胜负判定**：在一系列评估对局中，**胜率 (Win Rate)** 是核心指标。当智能体除脚部外的任何身体部位接触地面（即摔倒）时，即判负。\n\n### 三、性能提升与主要结果\n论文通过交叉对局（Cross-Playing）和消融实验证明了所提方法（LS-NFSP）的显著优势。\n\n1.  **整体胜率对比 (表1)**\n    *   **LS-NFSP vs. 所有基线方法**：均取得压倒性胜利（胜率68.52% ~ 100%）。\n    *   **最关键对比**：LS-NFSP **100%** 战胜了在原始29维关节空间进行自博弈的基线（29Dof Action-Space SP），证明了**在潜在空间进行策略解耦的根本必要性**。\n    *   **策略算法对比**：在潜在空间内，LS-NFSP胜于Fictitious SP (68.52%) 和 Naive SP (76.24%)，证明了**NFSP机制能有效缓解策略循环，产生更稳健的最佳响应**。\n\n2.  **战术与物理指标对比 (表2 & 表3)**\n    *   **战术指标**：LS-NFSP的进攻命中率 (**0.685**) 和交战率 (**0.824**) 远高于所有基线。\n    *   **物理指标**：LS-NFSP的基础姿态稳定性 (**0.942**) 显著更高，扭矩平滑度 (**0.930**) 显著更低，证明了其**在激烈对抗中保持物理稳定的卓越能力**。\n\n3.  **消融实验的关键发现**\n    *   **潜在空间的作用 (表3-b)**：与在原始动作空间训练相比，潜在空间将命中率和交战率提升了约 **4-5倍**。\n    *   **热身训练的作用 (表3-c)**：没有热身训练（SP w/o Warmup）的版本几乎无法学习，命中率仅为 **0.050**，证明了课程式热身对克服稀疏奖励、启动竞争性学习的必要性。\n    *   **对抗运动先验的作用 (表3-d)**：移除AMP（LS-NFSP w/o AMP）会导致命中率从0.685下降至 **0.490**，说明**风格约束对于生成既有效又符合物理规律的动作至关重要**。\n\n### 总结\n**RoboStriker** 框架通过在**人类拳击动作捕捉数据集**上预训练，并在**大规模仿真环境**中利用**潜在空间神经虚拟自博弈（LS-NFSP）** 进行竞争性协同进化，实现了人形机器人自主拳击。其主要性能提升体现在：\n*   **竞争性**：在8x8交叉对局中胜率全面领先。\n*   **战术性**：进攻命中率和主动交战率指标大幅超越基线。\n*   **稳定性与真实性**：在保持极高物理稳定性和动作平滑度的同时，生成了符合人类风格的拳击战术（如滑步、反击）。\n该工作为将多智能体强化学习从抽象游戏成功扩展到高维、接触丰富的实体机器人竞争任务提供了一个行之有效的范例。",

            "question": "论文的主要局限性有哪些？未来可能的改进方向是什么？",
            "answer": "## 论文主要局限性分析\n\n基于对《RoboStriker: Hierarchical Decision-Making for Autonomous Humanoid Boxing》论文的深入分析，其核心方法虽然取得了显著成果，但仍存在以下主要局限性：\n\n### 1. **任务与动作空间的特定性**\n   - **局限性**：整个框架（包括运动库、潜在空间蒸馏、LS-NFSP）是围绕**拳击**这一特定接触式对抗任务设计的。所学习的潜在动作空间编码了拳击相关的运动基元（如移动、出拳），其泛化能力尚未在其他类型的动态交互任务（如摔跤、足球、协作搬运）中得到验证。\n   - **影响**：方法的通用性存疑。将其迁移至需要不同技能集（如投掷、抓取、复杂地形导航）的任务时，可能需要重新收集数据、设计潜在空间并训练，成本高昂。\n\n### 2. **对高质量演示数据的依赖**\n   - **局限性**：第一阶段（运动跟踪器）和风格约束（AMP）严重依赖于**专业拳击手的高质量动作捕捉数据**（46段剪辑，共14分钟）。这构成了一个性能瓶颈和可扩展性障碍。\n   - **影响**：\n     - 数据收集成本高，需要专业设备和人员。\n     - 数据的多样性和质量直接决定了策略的上限。如果数据中缺乏某些高级战术（如复杂的组合拳、假动作），智能体可能难以通过自博弈自发演化出这些策略。\n     - 限制了机器人形态的泛化。论文中使用Unitree G1机器人，其形态与人类相似。若机器人形态差异巨大（如不同关节数、连杆比例），动作重定向和跟踪将变得异常困难。\n\n### 3. **潜在空间的表达能力与瓶颈**\n   - **局限性**：潜在空间（32维单位超球面）是**静态的**，在第二阶段蒸馏完成后即被冻结。高层策略（LS-NFSP）只能在这个固定的空间内进行组合和探索。\n   - **影响**：\n     - **无法创造全新动作**：策略演化被限制在预定义的运动基元组合之内，无法生成训练数据中完全不存在的、全新的、可能更优的运动模式（例如，一种为机器人身体结构优化的特殊闪避技巧）。\n     - **组合爆炸的隐忧**：虽然t-SNE可视化显示了良好的聚类，但随着任务复杂度提升，有限的潜在维度可能成为表达复杂、长时序战术组合的瓶颈。\n\n### 4. **模拟到现实的差距虽被提及但未深入解决**\n   - **局限性**：论文提到了“sim-to-real transfer”并展示了真实世界片段（图1），但附录和实验部分**未详细阐述**转移的具体过程、遇到了哪些挑战、以及真实世界性能的定量评估（如与仿真中战术指标的对比）。\n   - **影响**：这使得评估其在实际机器人上的鲁棒性和实用性变得困难。仿真中的接触模型、传感器噪声、执行器延迟与真实世界存在差异，这些都可能破坏在潜在空间中习得的精细战术。\n\n### 5. **多智能体博弈的复杂性与均衡质量**\n   - **局限性**：LS-NFSP旨在寻找近似纳什均衡，但理论分析（命题3.5）基于一系列理想化假设（如紧凑策略集、有界收益、近似最佳响应）。实际训练中，PPO优化器的近似误差、函数逼近器的能力、以及有限的训练时长，都意味着找到的可能是**局部均衡**，而非全局最优。\n   - **影响**：策略可能陷入“**局部战术循环**”，即双方演化出一套相互克制但并非最优的固定打法，而无法发现更高级的全局策略。交叉对弈表格（表1）显示了优势，但未证明已收敛至无法被任何新策略击败的均衡点。\n\n### 6. **计算与训练成本**\n   - **局限性**：三阶段训练流程（运动跟踪、潜在蒸馏、自博弈）需要**大量的模拟资源**（4096个并行环境）和训练时间。每个阶段都可能需要数天甚至更长的GPU训练。\n   - **影响**：这限制了研究的可重复性和快速迭代能力，也阻碍了在资源有限场景下的应用。\n\n---\n\n## 未来可能的改进方向\n\n针对上述局限性，未来的研究可以从以下几个方向展开：\n\n### 1. **提升框架的通用性与可扩展性**\n   - **方向**：开发**任务无关的运动基元学习**。构建一个更通用的“人体运动基础模型”，能够编码行走、跑跳、推、拉、击打等多种技能，而不仅限于拳击。高层策略则根据具体任务（可以是足球、救援等）在这些通用技能上进行组合与优化。\n   - **技术路径**：使用更大规模、更多样化的动捕数据集，结合**扩散模型**或**大型语言模型**进行运动生成和语义控制，使潜在空间具备更强的可解释性和组合性。\n\n### 2. **减少对演示数据的依赖**\n   - **方向**：探索**无监督或弱监督的技能发现**。在仿真中，让机器人通过内在动机（如好奇心、 empowerment）自主探索，发现有用的运动技能并自动形成结构化潜在空间，而非完全依赖于人类演示。\n   - **技术路径**：结合**世界模型**和**分层强化学习**，底层学习可重复使用的技能，高层学习技能的使用策略。可以仅用少量演示数据对技能进行“风格化”微调，而非从头学习所有技能。\n\n### 3. **增强潜在空间的动态性与创造性**\n   - **方向**：引入**可学习的潜在空间进化机制**。允许在自博弈过程中，不仅策略在潜在空间内演化，潜在空间本身的表示（如通过超网络）也能根据战术需求进行微调或扩展，从而突破预定义技能集的限制。\n   - **技术路径**：采用**条件生成模型**作为解码器，其潜在条件可以是一个更灵活、可分层的表示。或者，将技能视为可组合的模块，通过神经网络动态生成技能参数。\n\n### 4. **深化仿真到现实的研究**\n   - **方向**：系统性地研究和量化**sim-to-real的转移性能**。设计更全面的真实世界评估指标，并开发针对接触式对抗任务的专用域随机化与域适应技术。\n   - **技术路径**：\n     - 在仿真中引入更真实的执行器模型、接触噪声和状态估计误差。\n     - 使用**系统辨识**和**在线自适应**技术，让机器人在真实环境中快速校准其模型。\n     - 采用**元学习**或**离线强化学习**，利用仿真中收集的大量数据预训练一个鲁棒的策略，使其能适应真实环境的分布偏移。\n\n### 5. **改进博弈理论与学习算法的结合**\n   - **方向**：探索更高效、更稳定的**大规模连续策略空间博弈求解算法**。研究如何避免策略循环，加速收敛到高质量均衡。\n   - **技术路径**：\n     - 结合**种群基训练**与**博弈论正则化**，维持策略的多样性。\n     - 利用**对手建模**来预测对方行动，从而制定更优的反制策略。\n     - 研究在非平稳环境中具有**理论收敛保证**的新算法。\n\n### 6. **探索新兴技术融合**\n   - **方向**：将**大模型**的规划与推理能力引入分层决策框架。例如，使用LLM/VLM进行高层战术规划（“现在应该佯攻左路然后右勾拳”），并将其转化为潜在空间中的目标或约束，再由底层控制器执行。\n   - **技术路径**：构建一个“**具身智能体**”框架，其中大模型担任“教练”或“战术指挥官”，而强化学习模块担任“运动员”，两者通过自然语言或潜在空间进行交互。\n\n### 7. **拓展应用场景与评估基准**\n   - **方向**：将RoboStriker框架应用于**更广泛的物理人机交互场景**，并建立标准化的评估基准。\n   - **技术路径**：\n     - 定义一系列具有不同物理复杂度（从推箱子到格斗）和博弈复杂度（从完全信息到不完全信息）的“**机器人竞技基准**”。\n     - 开源仿真环境、机器人模型和基线算法，促进社区共同推进该领域发展。\n\n**总结**：RoboStriker为解决具身多智能体竞争这一核心难题提供了一个优雅而有效的分层解耦方案，其价值在于**方法论上的突破**。未来的工作应致力于将其从一个针对“拳击”的**特化解决方案**，演变为一个适用于“通用动态物理交互”的**基础框架**，同时克服其对高质量数据的依赖和计算成本高的挑战，最终实现真正通用、高效、鲁棒的具身竞争智能。",
