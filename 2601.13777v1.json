flapping of wings to flight of birds or flies; spinning of blades to propulsion of submarines or of helicopters; cycling of legs to running or walking, etc.\nMany moving biological and robotic systems have passively deforming mechanical parts, most obvious among these in biology are flapping fins, bending wings, and beating flagella.\nIn systems where momentum decays quickly, such as small bodies swimming in high-viscosity fluids\n[Purcell,\n1977\n, Shapere and Wilczek,\n1989\n]\n, or walking with many legs\n[Zhao,\n2021\n]\n, or more generally in cases where momentum decays quickly enough for any other reason\n[Kvalheim et al.,\n2019\n]\n, these theories of propulsion take on a particularly simple form called the “\nmotility map\n” and arising from “\ngeometric mechanics\n”.\nThe contributions of our work here are:\n(1)\na machine learning model especially suited to the motility map of an under-actuated system, and\n(2)\na study of the sample efficacy of this method and its comparison with other methods, applied to multiple gaits of a physical robot.\n1.1\nGeometric Mechanics & Motility Maps\nIn 1977 Purcell gave a notable talk, discussing “life in low Reynold numbers”\n[Purcell,\n1977\n]\nand expressing how the physics of propulsion is fundamentally different for small organisms.\nThe interest in this question in the physics community lead Shapere and Wilczek to publish a paper in 1989 that arguably started the field of geometric mechanics by giving a general theory of how shape-change in microorganisms produced motion\n[Shapere and Wilczek,\n1989\n]\n.\nThey showed that in the low Reynolds number fluid dynamics regime that governs microorganisms there appears a first-order equation of motion which is linear in the rate of shape change.\nThis is quite unlike Newtonian dynamics that are typically used for modeling, and which take the form of second order ODE-s.\nIt is also “\ngeometric\n” or “\nprincipally kinematic\n” in the sense that only the shape of the motion matters, but the rate of motion does not – changing the body shape twice as fast moves the body through the world exactly twice as fast along the same trajectory.\nThe translation and rotation created by a motion depends only on the sequence of shapes.\nThe modern treatment of Shapere and Wilczek’s result derives its mathematical form from work done in the 90s by Bloch, Marsden, Ostrowski, and others under the name of “geometric mechanics”.\nWe direct the interested reader to the brief introduction to geometric mechanics in\nHu and Revzen [\n2025\n]\n, the treatis\nMarsden and Ratiu [\n1994\n]\n, or the up-coming book\nThe Geometry of Motion\nby Hatton.\nGeometric mechancis shows how to decompose symmetric (Lagrangian) dynamics into “\nbody frame\n” and “\nshape\n” coordinates.\nThe key result of geometric mechanics that is of interest here is the Reconstruction Equation\n[Bloch et al.,\n1996\n, eqn.1.2.1]\n, describing the body velocity\nv\nb\nv_{b}\nin terms of the body shape\nr\nr\n, its rate of change\nr\n˙\n\\dot{r}\n, and a “group” momentum\np\np\nassociated with the moving body frame\nv\nb\n=\nA\n​\n(\nr\n)\n​\nr\n˙\n+\n𝕀\n−\n1\n​\n(\nr\n)\n​\np\n.\n\\displaystyle v_{b}=A(r)\\dot{r}+\\mathbb{I}^{-1}(r)p.\n(1)\nThe group momentum affects body velocity via the shape dependent “\nfrozen inertia tensor\n”\n𝕀\n​\n(\nr\n)\n\\mathbb{I}(r)\n, and the shape velocity affects the body velocity via the “\n(local) connection\n”, also called the “\nmotility map\n”.\nFor many systems,\np\n=\n0\np=0\n, or\np\n→\n0\np\\to 0\nso quickly that the\np\n=\n0\np=0\nassumption is reasonable, leaving only\nA\n​\n(\nr\n)\nA(r)\nto govern the motion; such systems are called “principally kinematic”, or “geometric”.\n1.2\nOptimal Gaits for 2-dimensional Shape-Spaces\nWhile the mathematical elegance of the geometric mechanics theory of the 1990-s was appealing, the real breakthrough in understanding gaits came through the work of Hatton and Choset, more notably\nHatton and Choset [\n2011\n]\n.\nThat paper resolved a key technical issue arising from the fact that the “\nbody velocity integral (BVI)\n”, which is the component-wise integral of the body velocity\nv\nb\nv_{b}\n, does not accurately reflect how the body has moved, because, e.g. early rotations affect the direction of later translations, but the BVI does not capture this.\nHere\nHatton and Choset [\n2011\n]\nshowed how to choose a body frame as a function of shape such that the difference between BVI and the actual motion given by the “\npath ordered integral\n” of\nv\nb\nv_{b}\nis minimized.\nThey then showed how, for 2-dimensional body shapes, Stokes’ theorem could be used to directly find maximal translation gaits as 0-level sets of a “\nheight function\n” that arises from the motility map.\n1.3\n2D Data Driven Motility Maps\nWith the realization that motility maps could be used to derive optimal gait came the hope that motility maps could be obtained by directly measuring robot-environment interactions.\nThis was first done in\nHatton et al. [\n2013\n]\n, which obtained the motility map of a 3-segment Purcell-swimmer-like robot moving in a granular fluid, and used this to design maximal displacement gaits for this swimmer.\nUnfortunately, even for a 2-DoF, 3-segment swimmer finding the motility map required sampling the 4-dimension\nr\n×\nr\n˙\nr\\times\\dot{r}\nspace, making this method extremely challenging in practice.\nEven today, most groups’ work on optimal gaits relies on reducing the shape-space to 2 “modes” and using Hatton’s height-function methods\n[Chong et al.,\n2021\n,\n2022\n,\n2023\n]\n.\n1.4\nHigh Dimensional Data Driven Motility Maps\nThe 2D limitation for physical systems was circumvented in 2018 when Bittner, Hatton, and Revzen proposed an alternative\n[Bittner et al.,\n2018\n]\n.\nBy applying methods of “\nData Driven Floquet Analysis (DDFA)\n”\n[Revzen and Kvalheim,\n2015\n,\n2017\n]\n, they obtained a model of the motility map restricted to a tube surrounding a gait.\nThey modeled the gait itself as a periodic function of phase using a Fourier series, and expanded the motility map in a first order Taylor series around the nominal gait.\nIn their method, each data sample was first assigned a phase\nϕ\n\\phi\n.\nThey binned the\nϕ\n\\phi\n, producing a bin index\nk\nk\n, and built the following model, estimating\n(\nv\nb\n)\nn\nk\n(v_{b})^{k}_{n}\n, the\nn\nn\n-th sample of body velocity at time index\nn\nn\n, from\nδ\nn\n\\delta_{n}\nand\nδ\n˙\nn\n\\dot{\\delta}_{n}\n, the shape and shape velocity offsets from the gait cycle,\n(\nv\nb\n)\nn\nk\n∼\n\\displaystyle(v_{b})_{n}^{k}\\sim\n(\n∑\ni\nB\ni\nk\n​\nδ\nn\ni\n)\n+\n(\n∑\ni\nA\ni\nk\n​\nδ\n˙\nn\ni\n)\n\\displaystyle\\left(\\sum_{i}B^{k}_{i}\\delta^{i}_{n}\\right)+\\left(\\sum_{i}A^{k}_{i}\\dot{\\delta}^{i}_{n}\\right)\n+\n(\n∑\ni\n,\nj\n∂\nA\ni\nk\n∂\nr\nj\n​\nδ\nn\nj\n​\nδ\n˙\nn\ni\n)\n+\nC\nk\n.\n\\displaystyle+\\left(\\sum_{i,j}\\frac{\\partial A^{k}_{i}}{\\partial r_{j}}\\delta^{j}_{n}\\dot{\\delta}^{i}_{n}\\right)+C^{k}.\n(2)\nThe then interpolated the tensors\nC\nk\nC^{k}\n,\nB\ni\nk\nB_{i}^{k}\n,\nA\ni\nk\nA_{i}^{k}\nand\n∂\n∂\nr\nj\n​\nA\ni\nk\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r_{j}}A^{k}_{i}\nusing Fourier series.\nSince this a linear model for each phase, they could reliably build a model using a number of cycles that is at most quadratic in\ndim\nr\n\\dim r\n— a breakthrough improvement when compared with the\nHatton et al. [\n2013\n]\napproach which was exponential in\ndim\nr\n\\dim r\n.\nWhile a single such sampling did not give an optimal gait, it could be used to make a gradient descent step in an optimization, and Bittner showed how optimal gaits with hundreds of parameters could be learned on both simulated and physical robots with about as many cycles of data.\nThe “\n(phase based) Total Least Squares (\nTLS\n)\n” method used in\nBittner et al. [\n2018\n]\nis one of the methods we compare here.\n1.5\nModeling Underactuated Systems\nIn a follow-up paper\nBittner et al. [\n2022\n]\n, Bittner and his collaborators considered that many biological and robotic systems have passively deforming mechanical parts.\nThe most obvious among these in biology are flapping fins, bending wings, and beating flagella.\nThe\nBittner et al. [\n2022\n]\npaper divided the shape variables into\nr\n=\n(\nr\na\n,\nr\np\n)\nr=(r_{a},r_{p})\n, where\nr\na\nr_{a}\nare actuated shape variables and\nr\np\nr_{p}\nare passive shape variables, and showed that if the passive shape variables\nr\np\nr_{p}\nare governed by a fairly general visco-elastic interaction term with the actuated shape variables\nr\na\nr_{a}\nand the with the environment (see also\nMurray et al. [\n2017\n]\n), the dynamics can be put in a form very similar to the motility map:\nv\nb\n\\displaystyle v_{b}\n=\nA\n​\n(\nr\n)\n​\nr\n˙\na\n+\nB\n​\n(\nr\n)\n\\displaystyle=A(r)\\dot{r}_{a}+B(r)\nr\n˙\np\n\\displaystyle\\dot{r}_{p}\n=\nC\n​\n(\nr\n)\n​\nr\n˙\na\n+\nD\n​\n(\nr\n)\n.\n\\displaystyle=C(r)\\dot{r}_{a}+D(r).\n(3)\nSystems with this structure are called “\nShape Underactuated Dissipative Systems (SUDS)\n”.\nIn Eqn.\n3\n,\nA\n​\n(\nr\n)\n=\nA\n​\n(\nr\na\n,\nr\np\n)\nA(r)=A(r_{a},r_{p})\nis the familiar motility map;\nB\n​\n(\nr\n)\nB(r)\na shape-dependent bias term; and\nC\n​\n(\nr\n)\nC(r)\nand\nD\n​\n(\nr\n)\nD(r)\nan affine map from the actuated variables to the passive ones.\nNotably, the dimension of\nC\nC\nis\ndim\n(\nr\np\n)\n×\ndim\n(\nr\na\n)\n\\dim(r_{p})\\times\\dim(r_{a})\n, which is potentially much smaller than\ndim\n(\nr\n)\n×\ndim\n(\nr\n)\n\\dim(r)\\times\\dim(r)\n.\nThe model itself is still linear and therefore just as easy to learn with phase dependent total-least-squares.\nWe use this model as one of the models in our comparison, referring to it as\nTLS\n+\nSUDS\n.\nBittner et al. [\n2022\n]\nshowed the efficacy of\nTLS\n+\nSUDS\non simulated systems, but never tested the method on a physical robot.\nOne of the contributions of the current work is its place as the first such experimental test.\n1.6\nAugmented Gaussian Branching Regression\nIn 2025,\n[Hu and Revzen,\n2025\n]\nproposed a specific sample-efficient machine learning method specially tuned to learning motility maps, called “\nAugmented Gaussian Branching Regression (A-GBR)\n”.\nTheir method was able to learn the motility maps of fully actuated robots with about\n×\n10\n\\times 10\nfewer data samples than a multi-layer-perceptron.\nFurthermore, their method did not require the input data to be from rhythmic motions with a well-defined phase.\nThey expanded upon “\nGaussian Mixture Regression (GMR)\n”\n[Sung,\n2004\n]\n, a type of Nadaraya-Watson estimator\n[Nadaraya,\n1964\n, Watson,\n1964\n]\n, to build a model of a generalized motility map\nv\nb\n=\nA\n​\n(\nr\na\n,\nr\n˙\na\n)\n,\n\\displaystyle v_{b}=A(r_{a},\\dot{r}_{a}),\n(4)\nadding the capability to be multi-valued based on recent history (the “branching”), and having hyper-parameters which bias the method towards linearity in\nr\n˙\na\n\\dot{r}_{a}\n(the “augmentation”).\nWe use\nr\na\nr_{a}\nrather than\nr\nr\nto remind the reader that this model uses only part of the state – the actuated shape variables.\nBecause their method can be just as easily applied to the fully actuated case\nv\nb\n=\nA\n​\n(\nr\na\n,\nr\n˙\na\n)\nv_{b}=A(r_{a},\\dot{r}_{a})\nand to the under-actuated case\n(\nv\nb\n,\nr\n˙\np\n)\n=\nA\n​\n(\nr\na\n,\nr\np\n,\nr\n˙\na\n)\n(v_{b},\\dot{r}_{p})=A(r_{a},r_{p},\\dot{r}_{a})\n, (the\nr\n˙\np\n\\dot{r}_{p}\nbeing provably unnecessary in the RHS; see\nBittner et al. [\n2022\n]\n) we used it in both forms.\nThese lead to the methods called\nGMR\nand\nGMR\n+\nSUDS\nbelow.\nMore generally, we use the term “adding\nSUDS\n” to indicate the process of modifying a model to include the passive shape variables\nr\np\nr_{p}\nand their dynamics.\n2\nMethods\nTo test the ability of various methods to identify the motility map of a SUDS, we built a system which would have the following properties\nFriction dominated\nThe system’s motion was so friction dominated that it effectively had no momentum – it stopped in place the moment its shape stopped changing.\nUnder-actuated\nThe system had 4 un-actuated shape variables, and only 2 actuated shape variables, i.e. it was “mostly” un-actuated.\nYet these un-actuated shape variables could meaningfully affect its motion.\n“Impossible” to model\nWe chose a system for which no existing physics models could reasonably be formed, to highlight the power of a data-driven / learning approach.\nDirectly observable shape\nAll the shape variables of the system could be measured in a straight-forward manner.\n2.1\nA 4-Flipper, 3-Segment Granular Swimmer\nThe system we selected is similar to the 3-segment swimmers familiar from many classical papers in geometric mechanics\n[Purcell,\n1977\n, Hatton et al.,\n2013\n, Zigelman et al.,\n2024\n, Yona and Or,\n2019\n, Hatton and Choset,\n2013\n, Shammas et al.,\n2007\n, Rizyaev and Or,\n2024\n, Melli et al.,\n2006\n]\n– it is a 3-segment swimmer moving through a granular material.\nWe chose red beans as the grains, for several reasons: (1) Beans are non-spherical, and it is only in the last couple of years that a kinetic theory of granular materials with non-spherical grains is beginning to form\n[Virozub et al.,\n2019\n, Hanif,\n2024\n]\n; (2) Red beans were cheaply available in bulk; (3) Because beans are large enough, it was easy to seal the robot against beans entering the mechanism and causing jamming.\nFigure 1\n:\n4-flipper, 3-segment swimmer. Picture of the swimmer in the granular medium (left), and schematic showing markers and angles (right). If the robot axes were all perfect hinge joints, the shape of the robot was fully characterized by the two motor angles\nϕ\n1\n,\nϕ\n2\n\\phi_{1},\\phi_{2}\n, and the flippers angles\nα\n1\n,\n2\n,\nβ\n1\n,\n2\n\\alpha_{1,2},\\beta_{1,2}\n. We measured the swimmer’s pose using 11 markers: 4 on the tail link — two on its top face (red, green dots), one raised on a spoke, and one lowered and attached to the back edge (teal, orange half-circles); 3 on the head link – two on the top face (yellow, gray), and one raised (magenta); one each on each of the flippers (gunmetal blue, cyan, purple, and brown).\nTo this classical, 2-actuator, 3-segment swimmer design, we added 4 passive “flippers” attached to the body on live hinges made out of fiber reinforced tape (Scotch #8959).\nEach flipper was limited by a piece of fiber tape allowing it to open only up to about\n80\n∘\n80^{\\circ}\naway from the body surface to which it was attached (see Fig.\n1\n).\n2.2\nMeasurement Instrumentation\nTo make it easy to observer the swimmer state, we made the swimmer frame substantially higher than the depth to which it sinks in the granular bed. We also added motion tracking markers (obtained from the motion tracking system vendor) and attached them to rigid spokes (bamboo skewers) which we hot glued and taped to the robot frame (see Fig.\n1\n).\nFor all of the experiments we used 4 Qualisys Oqus-310+ cameras, running at 100 [Hz] with QTM 2.17 build 4000 software, recorded with the QTM gap-filling disabled.\nThis marker-based measurement system gave us the spatial location of each marker, to sub-millimeter precision according to the vendor’s calibration results.\nFrom these data we derived both body frame and shape of the swimmer.\n2.3\nData Processing\nWe scanned the marker tracks for jumps larger than 9 mm.\nLess then 0.1 % of the data points were adjacent to such a jump.\nWe removed those points, and filled the gaps by linear interpolation.\nWe chose a body frame as follows.\nWe chose its XY plane to be the least-squares fit to the plane containing the 4 top-surface markers, and maintaining a constant Z offset from the remaining segment markers, i.e. it is a linear combination of segment markers that minimizes the Z variance, and has the mean Z of the top-surface markers equal to 0.\nWe chose origins for two segment frames to satisfy (in a least-squares sense) the conditions that: (1) they are in the XY plane; (2) the origins maintain a constant distance of each other.\nCondition (1) is an arbitrary choice; condition (2) expresses the fact that the segments were rigidly connected to each other, and we chose points on the motor axes’ intersection with the XY plane as the segment origins.\nWe took the mid-point of these origins as the origin of the body frame, with the line connecting the segment origins as the X axis, thereby fully defining the body frame.\nWe then projected the two top-surface markers of each segment on the XY plane, and took the their (2D) centroid as representing the pose of the segments relative to the body, and defining the segment’s X-axis.\nWe transformed all 4 flipper markers into the segment coordinate frames of the segments they were connected to, taking those positions to represent the shape of the flippers.\nThis allowed for the possibility that flipper axes were not perfectly aligned with the Z axis of the body.\nWe used cartesian values rather than angles to represent the pose, to avoid the heteroscedasticity caused by applying inverse trigonometric functions to cartesian marker locations.\nWhen inspecting our data, we noted that an unexpected parasitic oscillation appeared – the markers raised on spokes had enough inertia to oscillate.\nWe therefore combined the XY projections of the two markers raised on spokes and the XY projections of the flipper markers into a 12 dimensional state representing the un-actuated state.\nWe omitted the Z coordinates of these markers because they seemed to move so little in Z as to have an insignificant systematic structure.\nWe then reduced the 12-dimensional passive shape down in dimension by applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA).\nWe took the 4 largest components as the “passive” shape variables\nr\np\nr_{p}\n.\nThese 4 PC-s captured 96% of the variance in the original 12 dimensional un-actuated state data.\n2.4\nActuation and Gaits\nWe actuated the swimmer in 5 different periodic gaits, representing a circle (O), mild and extreme diamond shape (D-, D+), and mild and extreme square shape (S-, S+), all of average amplitude 1 radian (see Fig.\n2\n), given as Fourier series.\nFor each gait, we ran the swimmer at 3 frequencies:\n1\n/\n3\n1/3\n,\n1\n/\n2\n1/2\n, and\n1\n1\nHz.\nBetween trials we remixed and leveled the beans in the tub, and reset the swimmer to approximately the same location.\nWe then ran the swimmer for 10-30 cycles – until it came close to running out of room.\nWe repeated each condition at least 4 times.\n2.5\nLearning\nWe compared four of models for learning the motility map, arranged along two axes:\nTLS\nvs.\nGMR\n, and with or without a model of the passive shape variables:\nTLS\n,\nGMR\nvs.\nTLS\n+\nSUDS\n,\nGMR\n+\nSUDS\n.\nThe\nTLS\nmodels used the phase based total least squares methods of\nBittner et al. [\n2018\n,\n2022\n]\n, whereas the\nGMR\nmethods applied the A-GBR algorithm of\nHu and Revzen [\n2025\n]\n.\nWe evaluated each model using a bootstrap process.\nIn each bootstrap iteration we trained and tested each model with the same number of data points.\nWe used 30 cycles to train each model by picking a trial at random, and a 30 cycle interval from that trial.\nWe down-sampled all frequencies to have the same number of data points by direct decimation (no down-sampling filter applied), so as to preserve identical measurement error characteristics.\nWe then tested the models against a different trial that was randomly selected using the same process.\nWe repeated this bootstrap process for each model, for all pairs of gait and frequency against all pairs of gait and frequency.\nThe “RMS error” we report as our goodness of prediction metric is the RMS prediction error of the robot’s velocity along its own X axis, in arbitrary (but consistent) units.\nWhile other components of the motion – Y velocity, rotation rate, and even changes in Z – existed, they were very small and noisy, and thus less suitable for generating a comparison between models.\nFigure 2\n:\nCommanded and measured theoretical gaits. We plotted the commanded\n(\nϕ\n1\n,\nϕ\n2\n)\n(\\phi_{1},\\phi_{2})\nvalues (solid lines) and the measured angles (dots, same color).

We plotted box plots (default\nmatplotlib\nparameters) of each category: same frequency error distributions (right), and different frequency error distributions (left).\nOn the gait axis running S+,S-,O,D-,D+, we categorized pairing as same-gait, near-gait – one step apart, and far-gait – more than one step apart (see Fig.\n2\n).\nFigure 4\n:\nPrediction error by gait similarity and model type. We plotted box plots (default\nmatplotlib\nparameters) of log RMS error distributions each category: same gait (right), near gait (middle), and far gait (left).\nWe also considered the possibility of frequency and gait geometry interactions (see Fig.\n5\n).\nFigure 5\n:\nPrediction error by combined frequency similarity and gait similarity, by model type. We plotted box plots (default\nmatplotlib\nparameters) of log RMS error distributions each category.\nIn Figure\n3\nwe showed the log of the RMS prediction error for each model for same and different frequencies for all of the geometries.\nFor both, same and different frequencies the\nGMR\nbased models increased the prediction accuracy approximately 40% from the\nTLS\nbased models.\nAdding the\nSUDS\nto the\nGMR\nin this case increased the accuracy by around 3%.\nThe\nTLS\n+\nSUDS\nbased models increased the prediction accuracy approximately 30% from the\nTLS\nbased models.\nIn Figure\n4\nwe showed the log of the RMS prediction error for each model for same and near and far geometries for all of the frequencies.\nFor same geometry the\nGMR\nbased models increased the prediction accuracy by 48% from the\nTLS\nbased models.\nThe\nTLS\n+\nSUDS\nbased models increased the prediction accuracy approximately 34% from the\nTLS\nbased models.\nFor near and far geometries the\nGMR\nbased models increased the prediction accuracy by 40% from the\nTLS\nbased models.\nThe\nTLS\n+\nSUDS\nbased models increased the prediction accuracy approximately 29% from the\nTLS\nbased models.\nIn Figure\n5\nwe showed the log of the RMS prediction error for each model for the combination categories of geometries and frequencies.\nFor the same-same category the\nGMR\n+\nSUDS\nbased model got better prediction accuracy then the\nGMR\nbased model.\nFor the other categories, we obtained better prediction accuracy for predicting the closer gait to the model gait, for same frequency with near and far geometry and for the different frequency with same geometry.\n3.2\nIndependent Effects and Interaction Effects\nWe obtained a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) of the log RMS error, with single term direct effects:\ny\n=\n\\displaystyle y=\nconst.\n+\na\n⋅\nSUDS\n+\nb\n⋅\nGMR\n\\displaystyle\\text{\\bf~const.}+a{\\cdot\\text{\\bf{{SUDS}}}}+b{\\cdot\\text{\\bf{{GMR}}}}\n+\nc\n⋅\n(model-period\n<\ndata-period)\n\\displaystyle+c{\\cdot\\text{\\bf{(model-period}}}<\\text{\\bf data-period)}\n+\nd\n⋅\n(mode-period=data-period)\n\\displaystyle+d{\\cdot\\text{\\bf{(mode-period=data-period)}}}\n(5)\n+\ne\n⋅\n(model-gait = data-gait)\n\\displaystyle+e{\\cdot\\text{\\bf{(model-gait = data-gait)}}}\n+\nf\n⋅\n(model-gait far from data-gait)\n\\displaystyle+f{\\cdot\\text{\\bf{(model-gait far from data-gait)}}}\nWe also obtained a GLM with all first-order interaction terms of the same predictors.\nThe results are in Table\n1\n.\nIn the direct-effects model, both\nSUDS\nand\nGMR\nconsiderably reduce error, with\nGMR\nshowing a larger average effect.\nAdditionally, in-sample modeling of period and gait shape further decreased error, while significant gait mismatches increased it.\nInterestingly, there was no direct cost or benefit to using data collected at lower frequencies for modeling motions at higher frequencies.\nThe full interaction model indicated that these effects has strong interaction terms.\nThe benefit of switching from\nTLS\nto\nTLS\n+\nSUDS\nwas about 52% error reduction, where the switch the\nGMR\nwould have given a 62% reduction.\nApply both enhancements to get to\nGMR\n+\nSUDS\ngives a 69% reduction.\nWhen using\nSUDS\nor\nGMR\nor both, almost all of the direct effect of frequency dependence was removed.\nAlmost all the effects of gait were small, with model gait being far from training data gait being a consistent negative across all algorithm choices.\nTable 1\n:\nGLM coefficient comparison: direct effects model and first-order interactions model. Because the dataset was large, all effects were statistically significant at better than\np\n<\n10\n−\n5\np<10^{-5}\n, and we omitted the\np\np\nvalues from our report.

(note: axes are log-log) (for spread see Table\n2\n)\nAcross all frequencies, increasing the number of cycles consistently reduced RMS error for all methods indicating improved estimation accuracy with additional data, although the effect was small for the\nTLS\nand\nTLS\n+\nSUDS\nmodels.\nThis reduction was most pronounced during the first 5–10 cycles, after which performance gradually saturated.\nIn all conditions, incorporating\nSUDS\nresulted in improvements over the corresponding baseline models.\nSpecifically,\nTLS\n+\nSUDS\noutperformed\nTLS\nacross the entire range of cycle counts, and\nGMR\n+\nSUDS\noutperformed\nGMR\nat high cycle counts.\nThis effect demonstrated that\nSUDS\nimproved sample efficiency and accelerated convergence.\nComparing models,\nGMR\n-based approaches achieved substantially lower RMS error than\nTLS\n-based approaches at all frequencies.\nWhile\nSUDS\nreduced the error floor for both models,\nGMR\nremained superior, indicating that increased model expressiveness played a dominant role in achieving low prediction error.\nThe excitation frequency significantly affected performance.\nErrors were highest at 1 [Hz], decreased at 1/2 [Hz], and were lowest at 1/3 [Hz] across all models.\nThis trend is common in many mechanical systems.\nAt higher excitation frequencies and energies, more vibrational modes achieve an observable amplitude and the motion becomes more complex.\nThe phase-only baseline demonstrated a high RMS error and showed little improvement as cycles or frequency increased.\nThis highlighted the limitations of relying solely on phase information and emphasized the need to understand fundamental geometric connection.\n4\nDiscussion\nIn this paper we set up to explore the benefit of\nGMR\n(A-GBR from\nHu and Revzen [\n2025\n]\n) and\nGMR\n+\nSUDS\nover the previously published\nTLS\n[Bittner et al.,\n2018\n]\nand\nTLS\n+\nSUDS\n[Bittner et al.,\n2022\n]\n.\nNeither\nTLS\n+\nSUDS\nnor\nGMR\n+\nSUDS\nhave previously been tested on data from physical robots.\nIn addition, we explored whether these modeling approaches could successfully model the motion of a robot with significant un-actuated dynamics, and underlying body-environment interaction physics which are likely not amenable to modeling with current tools from physics.\nOur 4-flipper, 3-segment granular swimmer provided a dataset for exploring these questions in some detail.\nIt also allowed us to peer into the question of sample-efficiency of these methods – how much training data is needed for each method, and how far would each method improve with more data.\nSomewhat surprisingly, when trying to generalize to gaits with a different shape or frequency, the\nGMR\nmodel which ignores the flippers out-performs the more elaborate\nGMR\n+\nSUDS\nmodel (see Figs.\n3\n,\n2\n,\n5\n).\nThe picture becomes a bit clearer when looking at the GLM models that describe the impact of various factors on model quality.\nWithout interaction, adding\nSUDS\nand switching from\nTLS\nto\nGMR\nlead to comparable single variable effects improving the outcome (see Table\n1\n).\nWith interaction we see that the interaction term is fairly large and in the opposite sign.\nThis suggests that the change to\nGMR\ncaptures some of the same information that the addition of\nSUDS\nprovided.\nIt seems that about 85% of the contribution of the passive shape variables can be expressed through a non-linear dependence on\nr\n˙\na\n\\dot{r}_{a}\n.\nThe similarity of the\nSUDS\nand\nGMR\ninteraction terms with the other variables, i.e. the fact that the\nSUDS\n×\n\\times\n(variable) coefficient is close to the\nGMR\n×\n\\times\n(variable), is also consistent with the notion that they do capture similar features of the dynamics.\nWhen we examined the dependency of the various models on the amount of available data (see Fig.\n6\n), the results were fairly consistent.\nThe phase-based model gave the poorest model, and reached this level with a minuscule amount of data.\nThe\nTLS\nmodel improved on this by a factor of about\n×\n3\n\\times 3\nshowing only a tiny improvement with more training data.\nAdding\nSUDS\nto\nTLS\nalong the lines of\nBittner et al. [\n2022\n]\n, gave a\n×\n3\n\\times 3\nto\n×\n10\n\\times 10\nimprovement.\nFor small training data-sets that consisted of only a few cycles of data,\nTLS\n+\nSUDS\nwas as good or better than\nGMR\n+\nSUDS\nbut\nGMR\nwas better than both of them.\nHowever,\nGMR\n+\nSUDS\nimproved rapidly with training data.\nIn fact, in most of Fig.\n6\n,\nGMR\n+\nSUDS\nimproved at a log-log slope close to\n−\n1\n/\n2\n-1/2\n, which is the rate at which the standard error of IID Gaussian noise is reduced by averaging.\nThis is the expected signature of a model that captures “all the physics” so that the residual becomes uncorrelated white noise.\n4.1\nConclusions\nWe have successfully demonstrated that adding\nSUDS\nterms from\nBittner et al. [\n2022\n]\nto a\nTLS\nmodel improves the ability to model a physical robot by a\n×\n3\n\\times 3\nto\n×\n10\n\\times 10\nimprovement.\nWe have also shown that\nGMR\n, or more specifically the A-GBR algorithm from\nHu and Revzen [\n2025\n]\n, is even more effective, but is out-competed by\nGMR\n+\nSUDS\nwhen enough data is available.\nThe rate of convergence of\nGMR\n+\nSUDS\nsuggests that it may have captured all the available structure in the data.\nAdditionally, we have seen that learning the model using slower recordings is highly beneficial, and that extrapolating too far from a training gait comes with a moderate cost.\n4.2\nFuture Work\nPerhaps the most obvious question is how these algorithms compare with more traditional machine learning approaches.\nThe work in\nHu and Revzen [\n2025\n]\nsuggests that\nGMR\nrequires\n×\n10\n\\times 10\nless data than a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) modeling the motility map, placing MLP and\nGMR\n+\nSUDS\nat similar data requirements.\nHow do they compare in practice?\nMore generally, a survey comparison of traditional machine learning tools applied to this task would help the community choose the appropriate tools for the task.\nFor a practical robot experiencing a changing environment and potential damage and performance degradation of parts, an online version of\nGMR\nor\nGMR\n+\nSUDS\nwould be highly beneficial.\nWe might improve these online tools even more by noting that the transition from\nGMR\nto\nGMR\n+\nSUDS\ncould be made more gradual, adding shape variables as more data becomes available.\nGiven that our choice of state variables was derived from PCA it is possible that other data reduction techniques such as the use of auto-encoder latent states would give even better “shape variable” predictors.\nThe classical motility map is linear in\nr\n˙\n\\dot{r}\n, but asymmetric friction can lead to a more complicated relationship which still gives rise to a motility map, albeit one which is merely continuous, homogeneous, and convex in\nr\n˙\n\\dot{r}\n(a.k.a. as a “Finsler metric”; see\nHatton et al. [\n2025\n]\n).\nTesting the ability of the\nGMR\nand\nGMR\n+\nSUDS\nmodel on systems with Finsler contact models may be another fruitful future direction.\nFinally, note that the full reconstruction equation Eqn.\n1\ncontains a “group momentum” term\np\np\n.\nFor some systems where\np\np\nis significant, the dimension of\np\np\nmight still be low.\nFor example, almost all of a car’s momentum is 1-dimensional along its the direction of motion; all other inertial motions are suppressed by tire traction and the suspension.\nCan these approaches for learning data-driven motility maps be extended to systems with low-dimensional momentum?\n4.3\nFinal notes\nWe believe that the insights geometric mechanics provides into the physics of propulsion create a huge opportunity for improving our models of robot and animal locomotion.\nThey also provide structure which can be exploited to create learning algorithms that may enable the robots of the future to move reliably and adapt quickly to changes in the body-environment interaction, and may provide insights into the evolution and the pathologies of animal locomotion control.\nTable 2\n:\nSpread of results in Fig.\n6\nInter-quartile range (IQR) values at 1/3 Hz\nModel\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nTLS\n+\nSUDS\n6.12\n5.57\n5.40\n5.35\n5.31\n5.20\n5.27\nGMR\n+\nSUDS\n5.82\n4.69\n4.32\n4.16\n3.77\n3.62\n3.50\nTLS\n11.80\n11.70\n11.67\n11.83\n11.69\n11.71\n11.79\nGMR\n4.30\n3.53\n3.28\n3.10\n3.02\n2.94\n2.91\nPhase only\n15.88\n16.05\n15.77\n15.84\n15.80\n16.09\n16.10\nModel\n8\n9\n10\n21\n30\n39\n48\nTLS\n+\nSUDS\n5.26\n5.28\n5.22\n5.12\n5.13\n5.22\n5.22\nGMR\n+\nSUDS\n3.38\n3.23\n3.10\n2.65\n2.59\n2.51\n2.53\nTLS\n11.71\n11.71\n11.67\n11.65\n11.70\n11.54\n11.62\nGMR\n2.85\n2.83\n2.81\n2.63\n2.62\n2.62\n2.61\nPhase only\n15.99\n15.88\n16.06\n15.98\n15.97\n15.88\n15.92\nInter-quartile range (IQR) values at 1/2 Hz\nModel\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nTLS\n+\nSUDS\n8.08\n7.07\n7.05\n6.94\n6.54\n6.67\n6.87\nGMR\n+\nSUDS\n9.26\n7.44\n7.10\n6.87\n5.87\n5.90\n5.90\nTLS\n12.71\n12.61\n12.72\n12.77\n12.43\n12.61\n12.95\nGMR\n6.42\n5.51\n5.48\n5.26\n4.78\n4.82\n4.98\nPhase only\n16.56\n16.37\n15.96\n16.47\n15.99\n16.25\n16.11\nModel\n8\n9\n10\n21\n30\n39\n48\nTLS\n+\nSUDS\n6.51\n6.55\n6.63\n6.53\n6.42\n6.51\n6.65\nGMR\n+\nSUDS\n5.52\n5.37\n5.33\n4.39\n4.23\n4.20\n4.24\nTLS\n12.72\n12.50\n12.55\n12.16\n12.13\n12.29\n12.32\nGMR\n4.66\n4.70\n4.68\n4.49\n4.36\n4.42\n4.49\nPhase only\n16.26\n15.96\n15.54\n16.18\n15.79\n15.72\n16.15\nInter-quartile range (IQR) values at 1 Hz\nModel\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nTLS\n+\nSUDS\n13.18\n11.07\n10.38\n9.97\n9.41\n9.83\n9.56\nGMR\n+\nSUDS\n20.77\n15.12\n12.54\n11.14\n9.90\n10.07\n9.42\nTLS\n34.11\n32.15\n31.92\n30.58\n31.79\n30.24\n30.45\nGMR\n10.46\n9.71\n8.97\n8.26\n7.93\n8.28\n7.94\nPhase only\n56.75\n55.73\n57.58\n56.53\n58.49\n55.19\n55.62\nModel\n8\n9\n10\n21\n30\n39\n48\nTLS\n+\nSUDS\n9.27\n9.76\n9.77\n8.49\n9.04\n8.81\n9.13\nGMR\n+\nSUDS\n8.88\n9.29\n8.92\n7.06\n7.20\n6.93\n7.13\nTLS\n30.71\n31.13\n30.11\n29.63\n29.27\n29.15\n28.70\nGMR\n7.68\n7.85\n7.89\n6.51\n7.02\n6.90\n7.15\nPhase only\n55.92\n56.87\n57.74\n56.77\n58.07\n56.90\n57.55\nReferences\nBittner et al.

    "preview_text": "Geometric mechanics provides valuable insights into how biological and robotic systems use changes in shape to move by mechanically interacting with their environment. In high-friction environments it provides that the entire interaction is captured by the ``motility map''. Here we compare methods for learning the motility map from motion tracking data of a physical robot created specifically to test these methods by having under-actuated degrees of freedom and a hard to model interaction with its substrate. We compared four modeling approaches in terms of their ability to predict body velocity from shape change within the same gait, across gaits, and across speeds. Our results show a trade-off between simpler methods which are superior on small training datasets, and more sophisticated methods, which are superior when more training data is available.\n\nSample Efficient Learning of Body-Environment Interaction of an Under-Actuated System\nZvi Chapnik\nMechanical Engineering, Technion, Haifa, Israel\nYizhar Or\nMechanical Engineering, Technion, Haifa, Israel\nShai Revzen\nCorresponding author: Shai Revzen, EECS Room #4225, 1301 Beal Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA\nshrevzen@umich.edu\nElectrical Engineering and Computer Science, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI USA\nAbstract\nGeometric mechanics provides valuable insights into how biological and robotic systems use changes in shape to move by mechanically interacting with their environment.\nIn high-friction environments it provides that the entire interaction is captured by the “motility map”.\nHere we compare methods for learning the motility map from motion tracking data of a physical robot created specifically to test these methods by having under-actuated degrees of freedom and a hard to model interaction with its substrate.\nWe compared four modeling approaches in terms of their ability to predict body velocity from shape change within the same gait, across gaits, and across speeds.\nOur r",
