Traditional approaches focus either on spatial task planning\n[\n1\n]\n,\nor on collective control such as formation maintenance\n[\n2\n]\n, while assuming\nunrestricted communication for instantaneous information sharing. This assumption breaks down\nin real deployments, where communication is limited by obstacles\n[\n3\n]\n, or range\nconstraints\n[\n4\n]\n.\nSuch limitations necessitate coordination of communication events. The challenge intensifies in dynamic unknown\nenvironments with unpredictable tasks and workspace models. Existing methods remain limited:\nstatic schedules\n[\n1\n]\nfail under unexpected tasks; dynamic\napproaches\n[\n5\n]\nrequire prior knowledge of distributions; and pairwise\nprotocols\n[\n6\n]\nlack team-wide coordination, leading to degraded\ninformation flow. This creates a critical gap in jointly handling unknown spatiotemporal task\ndistributions and team-wide intermittent communication under constraints.\nThree fundamental challenges arise: the online discovery\ndemands rapid replanning of assignments and communication when tasks emerge\n[\n7\n]\n;\nthe sparse connectivity management requires\nstrategic use of limited communication windows to preserve coordination\n[\n8\n]\n;\nthe temporal constraints among tasks must be maintained between task deadlines and intermittent\ncommunication opportunities\n[\n9\n]\n.\nThese challenges amplify with large fleets,\nwhere co-optimizing tasks and communication becomes combinatorially complex.\nFigure 1:\nHardware demonstration of the proposed adaptive coordination and communication scheme\n(\nr\ni\nr_{i}\ndenotes an individual hardware agent\ni\ni\n,\n∀\ni\n∈\n𝒩\n\\forall i\\in\\mathcal{N}\n):\n4\n4\nUGVs to fulfil office errands such as delivery and cleaning as requested online (\ntop\n);\n2\n2\nUAVs and\n4\n4\nUGVs to detect fire hazards, search and rescue victims\nduring a disaster-response mission (\nbottom\n).\nI-A\nRelated work\nFigure 2:\nOverview of the\nCoCoPlan\nframework,\nwhich integrates real-time task detection,\na branch-and-bound planner for joint task and communication scheduling,\nand an adaptation scheme to unknown spatio-temporal task distributions.\nI-A\n1\nCoordination under Limited Communication\nCommunication is critical for multi-agent systems, especially in scenarios such as exploration and inspection where agents\nmust exchange information to maintain alignment and improve outcomes. Existing approaches\neither employ an end-to-end connectivity model with constant communication, or an intermittent\nmodel where agents communicate only when necessary. Both involve trade-offs in efficiency,\nflexibility, and adaptability. All-time communication usually focuses on connectivity control,\noften using graph theory\n[\n10\n,\n11\n]\n, either by maintaining all initial links\n[\n10\n]\nor dynamically adding and removing them while preserving connectivity\n[\n12\n]\n.\nWhile this approach guarantees reliable data transfer,\nit often overlooks the communication needs of high-level, collaborative tasks.\nMoreover, it can be impractical in the presence of wireless channel uncertainties.\nSome studies address the joint constraints of connectivity\nand temporal tasks\n[\n13\n]\n, yet they\ntypically impose strict proximity requirements, reducing overall efficiency in large-scale deployments.\nI-A\n2\nIntermittent Communication under Complex Temporal Tasks\nTo overcome these limitations, intermittent communication has been proposed as an alternative\nsolution\n[\n6\n,\n9\n,\n14\n]\n. In this model, the communication network can be\ntemporarily interrupted, and agents exchange information only at certain times.\nTo this end, several related works adopt intermittent communication\nby predefining fixed intervals and optimizing meeting locations accordingly,\nincluding centralized\n[\n15\n]\n, distributed\n[\n16\n]\nand predetermined meeting-point approaches\n[\n4\n]\n.\nHowever, these works typically fix communication times while optimizing locations,\nlacking simultaneous optimization of both aspects.\nRecent work mainly studies pair-wise intermittent communication\n[\n6\n,\n9\n,\n14\n]\n, where communication occurs only when necessary. While\nthis improves efficiency, it enforces rigid patterns such as fixed schedules\n[\n6\n,\n14\n]\nor predetermined meeting points\n[\n9\n]\n, and introduces\ndelays due to asynchronous execution, which is problematic for tasks that need timely coordination. Thus,\nall-time communication sacrifices task efficiency, while pairwise protocols slow\ninformation propagation. To mitigate these drawbacks, team-wise intermittent communication was proposed,\nin which all agents periodically re-establish global connectivity\n[\n8\n]\n.\nThis differs from sub-team or clustered communication\n[\n17\n,\n18\n]\n,\nwhere “team-wise” denotes coordination within sub-teams or dynamically clustered groups.\nNevertheless, existing team-wise approaches still assume known environments\nand task distributions, limiting applicability in uncertain scenarios.\nI-B\nOur Method\nIn this work,\na multi-agent system handles complex temporally constrained tasks continuously released online as shown in Fig.\n1\n.\nWe formulate an online co-optimization problem to synthesize the collaborative task execution\nand communication strategies simultaneously.\nUnlike periodic team-wise or intermittent pair-wise communication protocols,\nour approach dynamically optimizes\nwhen\n,\nwhere\nand\nhow\nagents communicate or collaborate\nbased on real-time task specifications gathered online.\nTo achieve this, we develop a branch-and-bound (BnB) framework with\njoint encoding of task planning and communication events within unified search nodes.\nA novel objective function balances the execution efficiency against communication latency\nfor robustness across spatio-temporal task distributions.\nMoreover, communication events are optimized via an iterative algorithm\nthat strategically determines the communication locations and timings.\nAs shown in Fig.\n1\n, the method is validated through large-scale simulations\nand hardware experiments against several strong baselines.\nThe main contributions are three-fold:\n(I) A general online co-design of task planning and team-wise communication strategies,\nensuring the timely information propagation and efficient task fulfillment;\n(II) An adaptive coordination mechanism via a novel objective function robust\nto unknown task distributions and dynamic environments;\n(III) Extensive validation in simulations and hardware experiments\ndemonstrating the effectiveness in complex real-world scenarios.\nII\nProblem Description\nII-A\nWorkspace and Robot Model\nConsider a team of\nN\nN\nagents that share the common\nworkspace\n𝒲\n⊂\nℝ\n2\n\\mathcal{W}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{2}\n.\nEach agent\ni\n∈\n𝒩\n≜\n{\n1\n,\n⋯\n,\nN\n}\ni\\in\\mathcal{N}\\triangleq\\{1,\\cdots,N\\}\nis described\nby its position\np\ni\n∈\n𝒲\ni\np_{i}\\in\\mathcal{W}_{i}\n,\nsensor range\nd\ni\n>\n0\nd_{i}>0\n,\nand the action\na\ni\n∈\n𝒜\ni\na_{i}\\in\\mathcal{A}_{i}\n,\nwhere\n𝒲\ni\n⊆\n𝒲\n\\mathcal{W}_{i}\\subseteq\\mathcal{W}\nis the allowed workspace;\nand\n𝒜\ni\n\\mathcal{A}_{i}\nis the set of primitive actions.\nMore specifically, the actions\n𝒜\ni\n\\mathcal{A}_{i}\nrequire different\ncapabilities from agent\ni\ni\n. For instance, repair and rescue actions necessitate\nfine-grained manipulation capabilities,\nwhile delivery requires transportation capacity.\nThe motion of each agent is characterized by its

Each agent executes its current local plan\nτ\ni\n\\tau_{i}\nand progresses toward its next communication location.\nTo handle uncertainties such as varying\nexecution times and navigation delays, we adopt simple\nadaptation mechanisms: for each assigned task, the corresponding agents\nwait at the task region until all members have arrived before\nexecution; at each communication event, all agents wait until every\nagent has reached its designated communication location, ensuring\nG\n​\n(\nt\nc\n)\n∈\n𝒢\nc\nG(t^{\\texttt{c}})\\in\\mathcal{G}_{\\texttt{c}}\n.\nThis maintains both temporal and communication constraints,\neven when timing deviations occur.\nAt each communication event, agents exchange information about newly\ndiscovered tasks. A designated agent aggregates these into\n𝛀\nt\n\\mathbf{\\Omega}_{t}\nand invokes\nCoCoPlan\nto compute updated\ncollective plans and the next communication event\n𝐂\n\\mathbf{C}\n. The\nteam then follows the new plan, and this cycle of execution,\ncommunication, and replanning repeats until the mission ends.\nIII-C\n2\nComplexity Analysis\nThe complexity of Alg.\n1\nis dominated by its\nbranch-and-bound (BnB) search. With\nm\nm\ntasks and\nN\nN\nagents, a single\nexpansion step can generate up to\n𝒪\n​\n(\nm\n⋅\nN\n!\n)\n\\mathcal{O}(m\\cdot N!)\nchild nodes,\nleading to a worst-case total of\n𝒪\n​\n(\n(\nm\n⋅\nN\n!\n)\nm\n)\n\\mathcal{O}((m\\cdot N!)^{m})\nnodes.\nPer node, task expansion and bound evaluation are dominated by\n𝒪\n​\n(\nm\n⋅\nN\n!\n)\n\\mathcal{O}(m\\cdot N!)\n, so the overall worst-case complexity remains\n𝒪\n​\n(\n(\nm\n⋅\nN\n!\n)\nm\n)\n\\mathcal{O}((m\\cdot N!)^{m})\n. In practice, pruning substantially\nreduces the number of explored nodes.\nLemma 1\n.\nAlg.\n2\nreturns communication locations such that the\ncommunication graph\nG\n​\n(\nt\nc\n)\nG(t^{\\texttt{c}})\nis connected.\nProof.\n(Sketch)\nAll agents are initialized at the same communication point\np\n0\np_{0}\n, so\nG\n​\n(\nt\nc\n)\nG(t^{\\texttt{c}})\nis connected. At each iteration, the algorithm\nupdates a single agent\ni\ne\ni_{e}\nto a new point\np\ni\ne\np_{i_{e}}\nthat preserves a\ncommunication link to already–fixed point\np\nj\nn\np_{j_{n}}\n, thus adding a\nnode adjacent to the existing connected set. Repeating this for all\nagents preserves connectivity by induction.\n∎\nTheorem 2\n.\nAssume that communication events recur indefinitely and that at\nevery communication time Alg.\n1\nis solved to\noptimality for the adaptive objective (\n4\n).\nThen on each communication cycle\n[\nt\nk\nc\n,\nt\nk\n+\n1\nc\n)\n[t_{k}^{\\texttt{c}},t_{k+1}^{\\texttt{c}})\nthe returned plan is feasible w.r.t.\n(\n1\n) and (\n2\n),\nand locally maximizes the task completion rate over that cycle.\nMoreover,\n(\n4\n) provides a local approximation of the\nglobal infinite-horizon objective (\n3\n);\nUnder stationary task arrival and ergodicity assumptions,\nthe two optima coincide.\nProof.\n(Sketch)\nFeasibility on each cycle follows because Alg.\n1\nenforces the temporal constraints (\n1\n) and calls\nAlg.\n2\n, which guarantees connectivity via\nLemma\n1\n. Solving the branch-and-bound search\nto optimality ensures that the returned plan maximizes\n(\n4\n) over that cycle, giving a locally optimal\napproximation of (\n3\n). Under stationary, constant-rate\ntask discovery and ergodic cycles, the renewal–reward theorem implies\nthat the long-run average completion rate equals the time average of the\nper-cycle rates, so local and global optimality are equivalent.\n∎\nIV\nNumerical Experiments\nTo validate the proposed method, extensive numerical experiments\nare conducted across multiple scenarios. The method is implemented in\nPython3\nwithin the\nROS\nframework, and evaluated on a workstation equipped with an\nIntel(R) i7 24-core CPU and an RTX-4070Ti GPU.\nSimulation and hardware videos are\nprovided in the supplementary material.\nIV-A\nWorkspace and Task Description\nExperiments employ\nN\n=\n10\nN=10\nheterogeneous robots in two challenging environments.\n(I) The DARPA SubT challenge environment, measuring\n40\n​\nm\n×\n60\n​\nm\n40~\\text{m}\\times 60~\\text{m}\n,\ncontains narrow passages that test maneuverability under constrained conditions.\n(II) The subterranean caves, with a size of\n40\n​\nm\n×\n70\n​\nm\n40~\\text{m}\\times 70~\\text{m}\n,\ninclude irregular obstacles that serve as a complex setting for validation.\nAll robots operate with identical parameters: velocity range with maximum\nv\ni\nmax\n=\n2\nv^{\\texttt{max}}_{i}=2\nm/s, sensing range\nd\ni\n=\n8\nd_{i}=8\nm, and communication quality determined by the model in Section\nII-C\n.\nThe method activates during communication events.\nTask sequences\nτ\ni\n\\tau_{i}\nare executed using the native SLAM-based navigation package.\nIV-B\nSimulation Results\nFigure 6:\nResults of the proposed method in simulation, including representative\nkeyframes and task planning outcomes in the DARPA SubT challenge environment (\ntop\n)\nand the subterranean caves (\nbottom\n)\n.\nThe proposed method is evaluated in both environments, as shown in Fig.\n6\n.\nEach algorithm invocation takes 15s of computation with 100 nodes. In the SubT scenario,\nfour task types are considered: Type 1 fault detection precedes Type 2 cleaning, and Type 3\nindoor delivery precedes Type 4 equipment maintenance. In Fig.\n6\n(a), at 232s,\nthe robots establish communication and synchronize their plans. By 258s, execution begins, with\n2 robots performing fault detection. At 319s, the communication topology is reorganized for\nthe next planning cycle. In the subterranean caves, the task set includes: Type 1 rescue precedes\nType 2 cargo transportation, and Type 3 exploration precedes Type 4 mineral sampling. In\nFig.\n6\n(b), a communication graph forms at 157s to initiate task allocation. By 162s,\nrobots navigate to their goals, with exploration tasks completed before mineral sampling due\nto temporal constraints. At 177s, the communication topology is reorganized for continued coordination.\nThese results demonstrate real-time task allocation and communication topology adaptation.\nThe system achieves 4 communication events and 17 tasks in SubT, and 4 communication events\nwith 16 tasks in subterranean caves.\nIV-C\nComparison with Baselines\nTo evaluate the proposed method, it is compared against six baselines.\n(I) FIX triggers planning when accumulated tasks reach a threshold\nN\nN\n, and is\nadapted to enforce temporal constraints.\n(II) FPMR\n[\n20\n]\nuses a fixed communication point; for fairness,\nit is applied only to communication optimization while retaining the proposed\ntask allocation strategy.\n(III) FRDT\n[\n14\n]\ngathers robots around a fixed leader to\ncommunicate, and is likewise used only for communication optimization.\n(IV) FIMR\n[\n6\n]\nplans at regular intervals\nT\nc\nT_{\\texttt{c}}\n,\nused only for communication optimization to preserve adaptivity.\n(V) RING\n[\n9\n]\npairs robots with fixed partners and propagates\ninformation along the chain; it is modified to handle temporal and capability\nconstraints.\n(VI) Greedy communicates and executes any feasible tasks whenever robots meet,\nand is adapted to account for capability constraints during task allocation.\nFour metrics are reported: finished tasks, communication count,\ncommunication interval, and\nt\nc\n−\nt\nf\nt_{\\texttt{c}}-t_{f}\n, the gap between the\nlast task completion and the next communication. All methods are tested in both\nscenarios over three trials, each combining spatial patterns (clustered, uniform,\nsparse) and temporal patterns (spiky, uniform, low-frequency). Since the selected\nbaselines were developed under slightly different (often simpler) settings, the\ncomparison is intended to highlight performance in complex unknown scenarios\nrather than claim narrow superiority.\nIV-C\n1\nPerformance in Nominal Scenarios\nTABLE I:\nCOMPARISON OF BASELINES ACROSS TWO SCENARIOS.\nEnv.\nStrategy\nFinished\nTasks (#)\nComm.\nNum.

It also completes nearly three times and twice as many\ntasks as Greedy, while requiring 92.2% and 91.8% fewer communication events\nin the two scenarios. Compared to FIX with\nN\n=\n3\nN=3\n, substantially more tasks are\ncompleted (99.0 vs. 74.7 and 98.7 vs. 81.7). Against FIX with\nN\n=\n10\nN=10\n, the\nadaptive objective markedly reduces variance (0.8 vs. 6.6 and 0.4 vs. 4.8).\nFIMR with\nT\nc\n=\n35\nT_{\\texttt{c}}=35\ns exhibits instability across environments, with a\n14% drop in completion, whereas the proposed method remains consistently high.\nFIMR with\nT\nc\n=\n80\nT_{\\texttt{c}}=80\ns incurs long idle times and large variance.\nFPMR and FRDT are constrained by fixed communication, causing significant delays\nand exposing the drawback of rigid synchronization relative to adaptive\ncoordination. Overall, the proposed method consistently delivers high task\nthroughput while limiting unnecessary coordination overhead across diverse\ntask distributions.\nFigure 7:\nRobustness analysis: instantaneous variance of completed tasks (\nleft\n)\nand task-completion efficiency (\nright\n).\nFigure 8:\nSnapshots of extensive experiments showing operation in a 3D urban environment (\nleft\n)\nand a large-scale deployment with 100 robots (\nright\n).\nFigure 9:\nSnapshots of hardware experiments:\n(a)\nExperimental setup for service robots in office;\n(b)\nKey snapshots of task execution;\n(c)\nHardware deployment in 3D disaster response;\n(d)\nKey snapshots of collaborative task execution.\nIV-C\n2\nRobustness under Varying Task Distributions\nTo assess robustness under unknown spatiotemporal task distributions, a 600s\nexperiment is conducted with three phases. During the first 200s, tasks follow\na spatially sparse and temporally low-frequency pattern. Over\n[\n200\n​\ns\n,\n400\n​\ns\n]\n[200\\text{s},400\\text{s}]\n, they shift to a spatially clustered and temporally bursty pattern.\nFrom 400s to 600s, the distribution becomes spatially and temporally uniform.\nFig.\n7\n(a) reports the instantaneous variance of completed\ntasks. The proposed method maintains consistently low variance under changing\nconditions, whereas baselines exhibit sharp fluctuations.\nFig.\n7\n(b) compares task-completion efficiency, defined as\nthe slope of the task-completion curve. The proposed method sustains high mean\nefficiency with low variance in both environments (0.173\n±\n\\pm\n0.005 in SubT and\n0.176\n±\n\\pm\n0.006 in caves), while other baselines show substantial volatility.\nGreedy yields the lowest mean efficiency, and FIX with\nN\n=\n10\nN=10\nexhibits high\nvariance, underscoring the weakness of fixed thresholds.\nIV-D\nGeneralizations\nIV-D\n1\n3D Environment\nTo evaluate performance in complex three-dimensional spaces,\nan urban environment of\n60\n×\n40\n×\n20\n​\nm\n3\n60\\times 40\\times 20\\,\\text{m}^{3}\nis designed,\ndeploying a heterogeneous team of five UAVs and five UGVs.\nTask types are designed to leverage aerial capabilities,\nsuch as high-altitude damage inspection and building fire-rescue missions.\nFigure\n8\n(left) illustrates the resulting communication topologies\nthat emerge during task execution.\nThe system successfully completes 45 tasks within 415s while triggering only 11\ncommunication events, highlighting scalability of our method in 3D settings.\nIV-D\n2\nLarge-scale Fleets\nScalability is further assessed in a large-scale deployment of\nN\n=\n100\nN=100\nrobots\nperforming tasks analogous to those in the SubT environment.\nAs shown in Fig.\n8\n, the system completes 160 tasks within 198s,\nrequiring only six communication events to maintain coordination.\nAll tasks satisfy their temporal constraints, and the computation times is 5-15s.\nThese results demonstrate the capability to operate for large-scale robotic fleets.\nIV-E\nHardware Experiments\nTo assess practicality, hardware experiments are conducted in office service and\n3D disaster-response environments, demonstrating feasibility in real-world settings.\nIV-E\n1\nService Robots in Office\nThe first experiment uses a\n138\n×\n114\n×\n3\n,\nm\n3\n138\\times 114\\times 3,\\text{m}^{3}\noffice environment\n(Fig.\n9\n) with four UGVs: one delivery, one maintenance, and two\ncleaning robots. Each robot is equipped with ad-hoc networking units\n(Fig.\n3\n) and navigation modules. Five task\ntypes are considered with temporal priorities: fault detection (highest), indoor\ndelivery and garbage collection (medium), and stain removal and equipment\nmaintenance (lowest). At 80s, a floor stain is detected along with a coffee\ndelivery request. By 91s, a communication graph is formed and both tasks are\nassigned. The delivery robot finishes at 129s (purple block). A cleaning robot\nthen handles a stain detected at 137s, starting removal at 150s (blue block).\nAt 176s, a new communication topology is established for subsequent planning.\nOverall, 11 tasks are completed within 537s with only 5 communication events,\nindicating responsive replanning under dynamic and human-triggered\ntask arrivals.\nIV-E\n2\n3D Disaster Response\nThe second experiment takes place in a\n16\n×\n14\n×\n26\n,\nm\n3\n16\\times 14\\times 26,\\text{m}^{3}\ndisaster\nenvironment (Fig.\n9\n). Six task types are considered, including\nfirefighting before rescue and chimney servicing before building repair, along\nwith resource collection and water protection. The team includes two UAVs for\nmonitoring/maintenance and four UGVs: two for firefighting/repair and two for\nrescue. The first planning round completes at 23s, after which UAVs execute\nchimney repair, completed at 51s (pink block). Maintenance requires UAV–UGV\ncollaboration at 61s and again at 90s, with communication re-established after\neach phase to synchronize actions. In total, 12 tasks are completed in 248s,\ndemonstrating timely responsiveness and effective ground–air coordination in\nemergency conditions.\nV\nConclusion & Future work\nThis work presents a branch-and-bound framework that co-optimizes task collaboration\nand team-wise communication online,\nfor multi-agent systems operating in dynamic and unknown environments.\nThe proposed approach achieves efficient information exchange\nwhile meeting temporal task requirements, as validated through extensive simulations\nand hardware experiments.\nFuture research will explore\nthe hierarchical combination of global and local coordination protocols.\nReferences\n[1]\nJ. Huang, X. Li, and L. Gao, “A novel ga-cp method for fixed-type multi-robot collaborative scheduling in flexible job shop,”\nIEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering\n, vol. 22, no. 3, pp. 13 531–13 543, 2025.\n[2]\nW. Ren and Y. Cao,\nDistributed coordination of multi-agent networks: emergent problems, models, and issues\n. Springer, 2011, vol. 1.\n[3]\nX. Yu, D. Saldaña, D. Shishika, and M. A.

  "preview_text": "Multi-robot systems can greatly enhance efficiency through coordination and collaboration, yet in practice, full-time communication is rarely available and interactions are constrained to close-range exchanges. Existing methods either maintain all-time connectivity, rely on fixed schedules, or adopt pairwise protocols, but none adapt effectively to dynamic spatio-temporal task distributions under limited communication, resulting in suboptimal coordination. To address this gap, we propose CoCoPlan, a unified framework that co-optimizes collaborative task planning and team-wise intermittent communication. Our approach integrates a branch-and-bound architecture that jointly encodes task assignments and communication events, an adaptive objective function that balances task efficiency against communication latency, and a communication event optimization module that strategically determines when, where and how the global connectivity should be re-established. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving a 22.4% higher task completion rate, reducing communication overhead by 58.6%, and improving the scalability by supporting up to 100 robots in dynamic environments. Hardware experiments include the complex 2D office environment and large-scale 3D disaster-response scenario.\n\nCoCoPlan: Adaptive Coordination and Communication for Multi-robot Systems\nin Dynamic and Unknown Environments\nXintong Zhang\n2,†\n, Junfeng Chen\n1,†\n, Yuxiao Zhu\n2\n, Bing Luo\n2\n,\nand Meng Guo\n1\nReceived 29 August 2025; Revised 29 November 2025; Accepted 29 December 2025.\nThis article was recommended for publication by Editor M.
