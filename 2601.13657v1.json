Inspired by biological swarms where informed individuals guide groups without explicit communication, we employ an implicit leader-follower framework. In this paradigm, only the leader possesses goal information, while follower UAVs learn robust policies using only onboard LiDAR sensing, without requiring any inter-agent communication or leader identification. Our system utilizes LiDAR point clustering and an extended Kalman filter for stable neighbor tracking, providing reliable perception independent of external positioning systems. The core of our approach is a DRL controller, trained in GPU-accelerated Nvidia Isaac Sim, that enables followers to learn complex emergent behaviors—balancing flocking and obstacle avoidance—using only local perception. This allows the swarm to implicitly follow the leader while robustly addressing perceptual challenges such as occlusion and limited field-of-view. The robustness and sim-to-real transfer of our approach are confirmed through extensive simulations and challenging real-world experiments with a swarm of five UAVs, which successfully demonstrated collective navigation across diverse indoor and outdoor environments without any communication or external localization.\nI\nIntroduction\nI-A\nBackground and Motivation\nUnmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms have demonstrated remarkable potential across diverse applications including search and rescue, surveillance, environmental monitoring, and precision agriculture due to their mobility, flexibility, and ability to access hard-to-reach areas\n[\n1\n]\n. By leveraging the complementary sensing capabilities and spatial coverage of multiple agents, UAV swarms can accomplish complex missions that are difficult or impossible for individual UAVs to achieve efficiently\n[\n2\n]\n. Collective navigation, where multiple UAVs move together toward common destinations while maintaining group cohesion, has emerged as a key enabling capability for these applications\n[\n3\n]\n.\nThe foundations of collective motion have been extensively studied across multiple disciplines. Reynolds\n[\n4\n]\npioneered distributed behavioral models using three fundamental rules: collision avoidance, velocity matching, and flock centering. Vicsek and Zafeiris\n[\n5\n]\nlater demonstrated that large-scale order can emerge from a much simpler rule: local velocity matching with noise. Olfati-Saber\n[\n6\n]\nprovided rigorous mathematical analysis introducing collective potential functions and\nα\n\\alpha\n-lattice structures for multi-agent coordination.\nFigure 1:\nAn example of real-world validation of the proposed LiDAR-based collective navigation.

(c) Sequential snapshots of the swarm avoiding obstacles to reach a goal without external localization or communication. More details can be found in the attached video at https://youtu.be/U4i3Spisugg.\nHowever, real-world deployment of UAV swarms faces critical challenges in communication-constrained environments. Inter-UAV communication can become unavailable or unreliable due to electronic jamming, signal interference, or natural disasters\n[\n7\n]\n. Moreover, even when communication is available, the bandwidth requirements and latency constraints for large-scale swarms can limit scalability and real-time coordination\n[\n8\n]\n. In such scenarios, communication-dependent methods become ineffective, necessitating robust communication-free collective navigation capabilities that rely solely on onboard perception and local decision-making.\nBiological studies have provided significant insights into communication-free collective navigation. Berdahl\net al.\n[\n9\n]\nidentified five key mechanisms in animal collective behavior: the many wrongs principle (averaging individual errors), leadership (guidance by knowledgeable individuals), emergent sensing (pooling sensory information), social learning, and collective learning. Particularly relevant to this work, Couzin\net al.\n[\n10\n]\ndemonstrated that effective group navigation can emerge from simple local interactions, where a small number of informed individuals can guide entire groups toward a destination without explicit communication or identification. This information asymmetry offers significant practical advantages for UAV swarms: it eliminates the need for mission broadcasting to all agents, reduces computational overhead, and enables scenarios where mission updates can only reach a subset of accessible UAVs. In communication-denied environments, where distributing goal information to the entire swarm may be infeasible, this approach becomes essential.\nThis biological phenomenon directly inspires the implicit leader-follower framework proposed in this paper. In this framework, follower UAVs navigate without goal information or explicit leader identification. Instead, followers learn to maintain cohesion with neighboring UAVs through local perception. As the informed leader navigates toward the goal, the entire swarm naturally moves in that direction through the followers’ learned cohesion behavior, without requiring explicit coordination or mission broadcasting. This emergent coordination eliminates the need for leader identification or goal information while preserving robust collective navigation.\nI-B\nRelated Works\nI-B\n1\nCommunication-Dependent Swarm Navigation\nCurrent UAV swarm implementations for collective navigation are broadly categorized into centralized and distributed approaches based on coordination architectures. Centralized approaches rely on external infrastructure for global coordination and precise state estimation. Representative systems include motion capture-based control such as Crazyswarm\n[\n11\n]\nand nonlinear model predictive control\n[\n12\n]\n, which achieve high-precision indoor navigation in obstacle-known environments by leveraging ground control stations for agent tracking. While demonstrating excellent coordination accuracy, their infrastructure dependence limits applicability to controlled indoor settings and causes network collapse upon infrastructure failure.\nDistributed methods achieve coordination through decentralized decision-making without centralized control, typically requiring inter-agent communication for state or trajectory sharing. MADER\n[\n13\n]\nsegments trajectory planning into perception, polyhedral representation, and optimization for multi-agent coordination. EGO-Swarm\n[\n14\n]\nemploys optimization-based methods partitioned into mapping, planning, and control modules, enabling autonomous flight in cluttered forests through trajectory information sharing. Zhou\net al.\n[\n15\n]\nintroduce a spatial-temporal optimization framework for fully autonomous UAV swarms navigating dense, unknown environments without external facilities. Vásárhelyi\net al.\n[\n16\n]\ndemonstrate evolutionary optimization for outdoor flocking using GNSS localization and wireless inter-agent communication. Recent learning-based approaches include deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for collision avoidance in fixed-wing UAVs\n[\n17\n]\nand end-to-end DRL for quadrotor swarms mapping local observations to motor thrusts, enabling zero-shot transfer to real robots in obstacle-dense environments\n[\n18\n]\n. However, these distributed methods fundamentally rely on continuous inter-agent communication for coordination—whether for trajectory sharing or state information exchange. Additionally, they typically assume either global mission knowledge across all agents or the ability to explicitly identify and communicate with informed leaders, limiting their applicability when communication is infeasible.\nI-B\n2\nPerception Strategies for Communication-Free Swarm Navigation\nTo enable operation when communication is unavailable, communication-free approaches employ onboard sensor-based perception for surrounding UAV detection and autonomous coordination, eliminating inter-agent communication dependency. Vision-based approaches have been extensively explored through diverse methodologies. Saska\net al.\n[\n19\n]\nachieved relative localization using monocular cameras with circular patterns in GNSS-denied environments. Schilling\net al.\n[\n20\n]\nutilized six omnidirectional cameras without position sharing or visual markers, with subsequent work\n[\n21\n]\nachieving markerless outdoor flocking with three UAVs. Ahmad\net al.\n[\n22\n]\nvalidated PACNav using ultraviolet-based relative sensing for navigation with four UAVs in natural forests. Wang\net al.\n[\n23\n]\nimplemented a bio-inspired visual projection field (VPF) approach with six UAVs in controlled indoor environments.\nHowever, vision-based systems face limitations. First, they suffer from illumination dependency, with performance degrading under varying lighting conditions including sunlight, shadows, or darkness. Second, monocular vision requires additional processing or motion to resolve scale ambiguity in depth estimation. Third, omnidirectional perception requires multiple cameras, critically increasing system complexity through increased onboard computational demands for processing multiple video streams and complex inter-camera calibration and synchronization. These factors become particularly prohibitive for small UAV platforms with limited computation budgets.\nLiDAR-based approaches provide promising alternatives that directly address these vision-based limitations. Unlike vision systems, LiDAR offers illumination-invariant perception, maintaining consistent performance across diverse lighting conditions. The direct time-of-flight measurements eliminate depth ambiguity inherent in monocular vision, while a single 360-degree scanning LiDAR achieves omnidirectional awareness without the computational overhead, multi-stream processing, and complex calibration requirements of multi-camera systems. These characteristics make LiDAR particularly suitable for resource-constrained UAV platforms. Recent work has begun exploring LiDAR for swarm coordination. Swarm-LIO2\n[\n24\n]\ndemonstrates a fully decentralized LiDAR-inertial state estimation system for aerial swarms, achieving robust neighbor detection through reflective tape that produces distinctive high-intensity returns in LiDAR reflectivity measurements. The system has been validated with five UAVs in real-world experiments, demonstrating the practicality of LiDAR-based perception for swarm coordination.\nI-B\n3\nControl Strategies for Communication-Free Swarm Navigation\nWhile communication-free perception enables neighbor detection without information exchange, achieving truly autonomous coordination requires control strategies that make navigation decisions based purely on local sensory observations, without communicated state information. This includes challenges of real-time occlusion handling, limited field-of-view (FOV), complex swarm interactions, and obstacle avoidance using only onboard sensor data. Traditional heuristic methods, such as Reynolds’ principles\n[\n4\n]\nand potential field-based obstacle avoidance\n[\n6\n]\n, provide stable flocking without communication but exhibit limitations. Manually designing fixed rules that generalize across diverse environmental conditions—including varying obstacle densities, swarm sizes, and spatial constraints—is extremely challenging. These rule-based approaches often suffer from local minima where conflicting objectives trap agents in suboptimal behaviors\n[\n6\n]\nand cannot adaptively adjust to dynamic swarm configurations\n[\n21\n,\n22\n,\n23\n]\n, often resulting in overly conservative maneuvers.\nLearning-based approaches emerged to address these limitations, enabling agents to learn adaptive control policies for balancing flocking and obstacle avoidance in communication-free settings. Imitation learning trains UAV policies using expert demonstrations, partially mitigating heuristic rule rigidity, but is constrained by the quality and coverage of expert data\n[\n20\n,\n25\n]\n. Acquiring high-quality demonstration data for communication-free coordination is inherently challenging, requiring experts to manually demonstrate complex behaviors under diverse conditions with partial observability.\nDRL offers a powerful alternative, overcoming both heuristic rule rigidity and imitation learning’s data dependency by enabling agents to learn policies through direct environmental interaction. DRL can automatically discover strategies to balance multiple competing objectives—maintaining cohesion, avoiding collisions, and handling perception uncertainties—through reward-driven optimization, without requiring explicit rule design or expert demonstrations. Huang\net al.\n[\n26\n]\nproposed vision-based decentralized collision avoidance using depth images and DRL for multi-UAV navigation without inter-UAV communication, but validated only in obstacle-free simulation environments. Bai\net al.\n[\n27\n]\nextended this for communication-denied environments with limited visual fields, but validated in simulations with simplified dynamics and pre-known obstacles, limiting real-world applicability assessment. As existing learning-based approaches are mostly validated in simulations, a critical gap in real-world validation remains, which this study addresses.\nI-C\nContributions\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose a novel LiDAR-based collective navigation system for robust operation in GNSS-denied and communication-denied environments. Building upon\n[\n24\n]\n, we eliminate all communication dependencies by enabling coordination through purely local sensing. Each UAV uses a single LiDAR sensor for 360-degree neighbor detection, removing the need for external localization or inter-agent communication. We employ an implicit leader-follower architecture where only the leader possesses goal information, while followers coordinate through learned reactive behaviors. Follower control policies are trained via DRL using proximal policy optimization (PPO)\n[\n28\n]\nto learn flocking and obstacle avoidance solely from local LiDAR observations. As an on-policy algorithm, PPO enables synchronous data collection from multiple UAVs and efficient batch updates in GPU-accelerated parallel environments. The DRL training enables followers to autonomously discover control strategies that balance cohesion with neighbors and collision avoidance with obstacles. Through this learned flocking behavior, the swarm collectively navigates to the destination as the leader moves toward the goal, without requiring explicit leader identification or goal information. The proposed system is validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments involving five UAVs. A sample result of the real-world experiments is depicted in Fig.\n1\n. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first LiDAR-based collective navigation system for a swarm of UAVs using DRL that operates without any information exchange and has been validated in real-world deployments. The key contributions are:\ni)\nA fully communication-free, LiDAR-based perception framework for neighbor detection and tracking to achieve robust UAV swarm coordination;\nii)\nA DRL-based control policy that enables implicit leader-follower coordination by learning to balance flocking and obstacle avoidance under realistic perception constraints; and\niii)\nComprehensive validation via extensive simulations and real-world experiments with five UAVs in diverse indoor and outdoor environments.\nII\nProblem Formulation\nII-A\nProblem Definition\nThis study addresses the collective navigation of a swarm of\nN\nN\nUAVs toward a specific destination in a GNSS-denied and communication-constrained environment. As illustrated in Fig.\n2\n, the swarm consists of one informed leader UAV, which possesses destination information via pre-loaded waypoints, and\nN\n−\nN-\n1 uninformed follower UAVs without such information. We assume a complete absence of information exchange, meaning each UAV cannot explicitly distinguish whether other UAVs are leaders or followers, requiring an implicit leader-follower framework. Each follower must utilize its onboard LiDAR sensors to perceive its surroundings in real-time, making autonomous decisions based only on locally observed information. The core challenge is for the swarm to maintain cohesion and effectively avoid obstacles, moving collectively toward the destination without dispersing, while addressing perceptual challenges such as occlusion and limited FOV.\nII-B\nSystem Models\nThe state of each UAV\ni\ni\nis its local position\n𝐩\nt\ni\n∈\nℝ\n3\n\\mathbf{p}^{i}_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}\n, velocity\n𝐯\nt\ni\n∈\nℝ\n3\n\\mathbf{v}^{i}_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}\n, and orientation (quaternion\n𝐪\nt\ni\n∈\nℝ\n4\n\\mathbf{q}^{i}_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{4}\n) at time\nt\nt\n. Each UAV\ni\ni\nhas a LiDAR sensor providing a raw point cloud\n𝐳\nt\ni\n\\mathbf{z}^{i}_{t}\nof its surroundings, which feeds into a perception module (Sec.\nIII-A\n). From this data, UAV\ni\ni\n’s state\n(\n𝐩\nt\ni\n,\n𝐯\nt\ni\n,\n𝐪\nt\ni\n)\n(\\mathbf{p}^{i}_{t},\\mathbf{v}^{i}_{t},\\mathbf{q}^{i}_{t})\nis estimated by LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO). Concurrently, the perception module processes\n𝐳\nt\ni\n\\mathbf{z}^{i}_{t}\nto detect and track neighbors\n𝒩\nt\ni\n\\mathcal{N}^{i}_{t}\nand obstacles\n𝒪\nt\ni\n\\mathcal{O}^{i}_{t}\n.\nWhile all UAVs share the same kinematic model for position updates,\n𝐩\nt\n+\n1\ni\n=\n𝐩\nt\ni\n+\n𝐯\nt\ni\n​\nΔ\n​\nt\n,\n\\mathbf{p}^{i}_{t+1}=\\mathbf{p}^{i}_{t}+\\mathbf{v}^{i}_{t}\\Delta t,\ntheir control policies for determining velocity commands differ by role.\nThe leader’s velocity is determined by a local planner\nL\nL\nusing its estimated state, perceived obstacles, and predefined waypoints\nW\nW\n:\n𝐯\nt\n+\n1\nl\n=\nL\n​\n(\n𝐩\nt\nl\n,\n𝐪\nt\nl\n,\n𝒪\nt\nl\n,\nW\n)\n.\n\\mathbf{v}^{l}_{t+1}=L(\\mathbf{p}^{l}_{t},\\mathbf{q}^{l}_{t},\\mathcal{O}^{l}_{t},W).\nEach follower learns a control policy\nπ\n\\pi\n, detailed in Sec.\nIII-B\n, that generates velocity commands based only on its estimated state and local perception of neighbors and obstacles:\n𝐯\nt\n+\n1\nf\n=\nπ\n​\n(\n𝐯\nt\nf\n,\n𝐪\nt\nf\n,\n𝒩\nt\nf\n,\n𝒪\nt\nf\n)\n.\n\\mathbf{v}^{f}_{t+1}=\\pi(\\mathbf{v}^{f}_{t},\\mathbf{q}^{f}_{t},\\mathcal{N}^{f}_{t},\\mathcal{O}^{f}_{t}).\nThe follower’s policy\nπ\n\\pi\nintentionally excludes position\n𝐩\nt\nf\n\\mathbf{p}^{f}_{t}\nas an input, even though it is available from LIO. This design is critical for learning a generalizable policy. Including\n𝐩\nt\nf\n\\mathbf{p}^{f}_{t}\ncould cause the policy to learn correlations between coordinates within the locally generated map and required control actions. Such map-dependent policies would fail in novel environments with different trajectories and layouts. By restricting input to the UAV’s kinematic state—velocity\n𝐯\nt\nf\n\\mathbf{v}^{f}_{t}\nand orientation\n𝐪\nt\nf\n\\mathbf{q}^{f}_{t}\n—along with local perception of neighbors\n𝒩\nt\nf\n\\mathcal{N}^{f}_{t}\nand obstacles\n𝒪\nt\nf\n\\mathcal{O}^{f}_{t}\n, the policy learns a robust, egocentric strategy based on immediate kinematic state and surroundings rather than position relative to an arbitrary starting point, significantly enhancing transferability.\nFigure 2:\nScenario of the communication-free collective navigation problem. A leader visits a known waypoint sequence, while followers, unaware of the goal or leader’s identity, use only local perception for flocking and obstacle avoidance to indirectly follow the leader.\nII-C\nFlocking Considerations for Implicit Following\nFlocking refers to coordinated collective motion emerging when individual agents follow simple local interaction rules\n[\n4\n]\n. Traditional flocking behaviors consist of three fundamental rules: cohesion for staying close to neighboring UAVs, separation for maintaining safe distances to avoid collisions with neighbors, and alignment for matching velocity directions with neighbors.\nHowever, we deliberately exclude the alignment term from our flocking behavior. This design choice is crucial for our communication-free implicit leader-follower scenario, where followers cannot identify the leader and the leader may exhibit diverse motion patterns—including hovering, directional changes, or backward movement—depending on mission objectives and obstacle configurations. Incorporating velocity alignment would cause followers to align with the average velocity direction of all perceived neighbors rather than specifically following the leader’s directional changes. Since followers cannot distinguish the leader, when the leader suddenly changes direction to navigate toward a new location, followers maintaining alignment with neighbors’ average velocity would dilute the leader’s influence, potentially causing loss of the leader and mission failure. Therefore, our flocking behavior incorporates only cohesion and separation, allowing followers to navigate collectively while being responsive to the leader’s positional changes rather than being constrained by the swarm’s average velocity direction.\nII-D\nObjectives\nThe primary objective of this study is to develop a robust control policy,\nπ\n\\pi\n, trained via DRL. Using only onboard LiDAR data, this policy must enable followers to learn a balance between two types of local behaviors: flocking (cohesion and separation) and obstacle avoidance. The successful execution of these behaviors results in the emergent behavior of implicit leader-following, where the swarm naturally moves toward the destination as followers maintain positional cohesion with neighbors, which in turn are influenced by the leader’s goal-directed motion. Ultimately, the system aims to achieve collective movement in a fully communication-free manner.\nIII\nMethodology\nTo address the problem defined in Sec.\nII\n, the proposed system is built upon a decentralized control architecture where each UAV independently perceives its environment and makes decisions. This architecture is composed of two core modules: a LiDAR-based perception system (Fig.\n3\n) that detects neighboring UAVs and obstacles in real-time, and a DRL control policy (Fig.\n4\n) that learns to balance the competing demands of flocking and obstacle avoidance. The perception system generates local observations that are fed as an input to the control policy, which in turn outputs velocity commands. The integration of these modules enables the emergent behavior of stable collective navigation, allowing the entire swarm to reach a target destination known only to the leader, without explicit communication or reliance on an external positioning system.\nFigure 3:\nOverview of the onboard perception system. (a) The perception pipeline. (b) The object tracker filters raw LiDAR points, clusters them using DBSCAN, tracks them with an EKF, and validates them based on temporal consistency.\nIII-A\nLiDAR-Based Perception System\nThe proposed LiDAR-based perception pipeline consists of three main components: (1) a LIO module for ego-state estimation, (2) an object tracker module for neighbor detection and tracking, and (3) a point downsampling module that transforms the raw point cloud into low-dimensional features for computational efficiency. The resulting perception outputs are fed into the neural network. Each UAV is equipped with reflective tape to produce high-intensity LiDAR returns, crucial for detection. Based on the high-intensity returns, the object tracker operates in three stages with all geometry computed in the local map frame: filtering, clustering/tracking, and validation.\nIII-A\n1\nPoint Cloud Filtering\nThe first stage filters the raw point cloud of each UAV\ni\ni\n,\n𝐳\nt\ni\n\\mathbf{z}^{i}_{t}\n, as shown in Fig.\n3\n(b)-1. To improve point density, we stack the most recent\nB\nB\npoint clouds. Each point\n𝐩\nb\n{{}^{b}}\\mathbf{p}\nis transformed into the map frame using the transformation\n𝐩\nm\n=\nT\nm\n←\nb\n​\n𝐩\nb\n{{}^{m}}\\mathbf{p}=T_{m\\leftarrow b}\\,{{}^{b}}\\mathbf{p}\n, where\nT\nm\n←\nb\nT_{m\\leftarrow b}\nis obtained from the LIO module and subsequently gated by its Euclidean distance to the UAV position, retaining only points within range\n[\nd\nmin\n,\nd\nmax\n]\n[d_{\\min},d_{\\max}]\n.\nThe resulting distance-gated points,\n𝒫\nd\n\\mathcal{P}_{d}\n, are filtered based on two criteria. First, we identify high-intensity points\n𝒫\nhigh\n\\mathcal{P}_{\\text{high}}\n. Since reflective tape provides high-intensity returns, points with intensity\nI\nI\ngreater than or equal to threshold\nI\nhigh\nI_{\\text{high}}\nare utilized as key seeds to detect new objects.\n𝒫\nhigh\n=\n{\n𝐩\n∈\n𝒫\nd\n|\nI\n≥\nI\nhigh\n}\n.\n\\mathcal{P}_{\\text{high}}=\\{\\,\\mathbf{p}\\in\\mathcal{P}_{d}\\;|\\;I\\geq I_{\\text{high}}\\,\\}.\nSecond, we retain region of interest (ROI) points\n𝒫\nroi\n\\mathcal{P}_{\\text{roi}}\nto maintain tracks during temporary occlusions. From remaining low-intensity points\n𝒫\nlow\n\\mathcal{P}_{\\text{low}}\n, we select those within radius\nr\nroi\nr_{\\text{roi}}\nof existing track centroids\n𝐜\n^\nj\nm\n{{}^{m}}\\hat{\\mathbf{c}}^{j}\n.\n𝒫\nroi\n=\n{\n𝐩\n∈\n𝒫\nlow\n|\nmin\nj\n⁡\n‖\n𝐩\nm\n−\n𝐜\n^\nj\nm\n‖\n2\n≤\nr\nroi\n}\n.\n\\mathcal{P}_{\\text{roi}}=\\{\\,\\mathbf{p}\\in\\mathcal{P}_{\\text{low}}\\;|\\;\\min_{j}\\|{{}^{m}}\\mathbf{p}-{{}^{m}}\\hat{\\mathbf{c}}^{j}\\|_{2}\\leq r_{\\text{roi}}\\}.\nFinally, the union\n𝒫\nfiltered\n=\n𝒫\nhigh\n∪\n𝒫\nroi\n\\mathcal{P}_{\\text{filtered}}=\\mathcal{P}_{\\text{high}}\\cup\\mathcal{P}_{\\text{roi}}\nis passed to the next stage as shown in Fig.\n3\n(b)-2.\nIII-A\n2\nClustering and Tracking\nThe filtered point set\n𝒫\nfiltered\n\\mathcal{P}_{\\text{filtered}}\nis grouped into individual clusters\nC\nk\nC^{k}\nusing the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm\n[\n29\n]\n, which forms clusters based on a distance threshold\nε\n\\varepsilon\ndefining the maximum allowable distance between points and a minimum number of points\nn\nmin\nn_{\\text{min}}\n. Since point density decreases with distance, we apply distance-adaptive validation where the minimum point threshold scales with range. Each cluster is tracked using the extended Kalman filter (EKF)\n[\n30\n]\nwith a constant velocity model to estimate smooth motion trajectories of neighboring UAVs, as depicted in Fig.\n3\n(b)-3. Data association matches each valid cluster to the nearest existing track if their distance is below threshold\nd\nmatch\nd_{\\text{match}}\n. An associated track is updated via EKF, and a new track is created for a new cluster. A track is deactivated if unobserved for timeout\nt\ninactive\nt_{\\text{inactive}}\n.\nTABLE I:\nParameters for the LiDAR-Based Perception System\nParameter\nValue\nDescription\nPoint Cloud Filtering\nB\nB\n2\nNumber of stacked point clouds\nd\nmin\nd_{\\min}\n0.05m\nMinimum distance for point gating\nd\nmax\nd_{\\max}\n10.0m\nMaximum distance for point gating\nI\nhigh\nI_{\\text{high}}\n170\nThreshold for LiDAR intensity (0–255) for highly reflective points\nr\nroi\nr_{\\text{roi}}\n0.3m\nROI radius around existing tracks\nClustering and Tracking\nε\n\\varepsilon\n0.1m\nDistance threshold for DBSCAN clustering\nn\nmin\nn_{\\text{min}}\n8\n​\nB\n8B\nMinimum points per cluster (scaled by stacked frames)\nd\nmatch\nd_{\\text{match}}\n0.2m\nAssociation threshold for matching clusters to tracks\nt\ninactive\nt_{\\text{inactive}}\n0.5s\nTimeout for deactivating unobserved tracks\nCluster Validation\nρ\nhigh\n\\rho_{\\text{high}}\n0.05\nHigh-intensity ratio threshold for validation\nτ\non\n\\tau_{\\text{on}}\n0.01s\nContinuous duration for validation\nIII-A\n3\nCluster Validation\nThe final stage validates if a tracked object is a reliable neighbor UAV as shown in Fig.\n3\n(b)-4.

Each neighbor is encoded as a 7-D vector containing relative position, relative velocity, and a binary mask. The use of a fixed number of observable neighbors is a topological approach inspired by robust collective behaviors in animal swarms\n[\n31\n]\n. The selection of six neighbors balances performance and computational load, empirically verified in Sec.\nIV-E\n. When fewer than six neighbors are detected due to occlusions or limited vertical FOV, zero-padding and binary masks maintain a fixed input size while indicating the presence or absence of valid neighbor information.\nThe occupancy grid’s first channel contains proximity information, representing distance to the nearest obstacle in each cell, while the second channel provides a binary mask indicating cell occupancy.

The network consists of a shared encoder processing observations, followed by actor and critic heads. The entire policy is trained end-to-end using the PPO algorithm\n[\n28\n]\n.\nThe two-channel\n72\n×\n12\n72\\times 12\nLiDAR occupancy grid is processed by a convolutional neural network (CNN). The resulting feature map is flattened and passed through a fully-connected layer to produce a 256-D feature vector, which is concatenated with the 7-D ego-state vector and 42-D neighbor-state vector. The combined feature vector is passed through a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), outputting a final 512-D shared feature vector. The shared vector is consumed by two separate heads. The actor head is an MLP with a hidden layer of 256 units that outputs the mean and standard deviation for a continuous Gaussian policy. The critic head is a similar MLP outputting a single scalar representing the value function.\nThe training process consists of two core stages: advantage estimation, followed by policy and value function optimization. To evaluate how much better a specific action is compared with the average action in a given state, we use an advantage function,\nA\n^\nt\n\\hat{A}_{t}\n. We apply generalized advantage estimation (GAE)\n[\n32\n]\n, which computes advantages based on the temporal difference (TD) error,\nδ\nt\n\\delta_{t}\n:\nδ\nt\n=\nR\nt\n+\nγ\n​\nV\nϕ\n​\n(\no\nt\n+\n1\n)\n−\nV\nϕ\n​\n(\no\nt\n)\n,\n\\delta_{t}=R_{t}+\\gamma V_{\\phi}(o_{t+1})-V_{\\phi}(o_{t}),\n(1)\nwhere\nR\nt\nR_{t}\nis the reward,\nV\nϕ\nV_{\\phi}\nis the value estimated by the critic network, and\nγ\n\\gamma\nis the discount factor. GAE calculates the advantage as an exponentially-weighted sum of these TD errors:\nA\n^\nt\nGAE\n​\n(\nγ\n,\nλ\n)\n=\n∑\nl\n=\n0\nT\n−\nt\n−\n1\n(\nγ\n​\nλ\n)\nl\n​\nδ\nt\n+\nl\n,\n\\hat{A}_{t}^{\\text{GAE}(\\gamma,\\lambda)}=\\sum_{l=0}^{T-t-1}(\\gamma\\lambda)^{l}\\delta_{t+l},\n(2)\nwhere\nλ\n∈\n[\n0\n,\n1\n]\n\\lambda\\in[0,1]\ncontrols the bias-variance trade-off. The resulting advantages\nA\n^\nt\n\\hat{A}_{t}\nare normalized to zero mean and unit variance before policy optimization.\nThe policy and value networks are optimized jointly by minimizing a total loss function:\nL\n​\n(\nθ\n,\nϕ\n)\n=\n𝔼\n^\nt\n​\n[\n−\nL\nCLIP\n​\n(\nθ\n)\n+\nc\n1\n​\nL\nVF\n​\n(\nϕ\n)\n−\nc\n2\n​\nH\n​\n[\nπ\nθ\n]\n​\n(\no\nt\n)\n]\n,\nL(\\theta,\\phi)=\\hat{\\mathbb{E}}_{t}[-L^{\\text{CLIP}}(\\theta)+c_{1}L_{\\text{VF}}(\\phi)-c_{2}H[\\pi_{\\theta}](o_{t})],\n(3)\nwhere\nc\n1\nc_{1}\nand\nc\n2\nc_{2}\nare hyperparameters weighting the different terms.

This clipping mechanism is the core of PPO’s stability, discouraging overly large policy updates.\nFigure 6:\nSimulation environments.

Each training simulation instance featured a swarm of five UAVs, comprising one leader and four followers, navigating an environment with randomly placed pillars as shown in Fig.\n6\n(a).\nIV-A\n1\nEnvironment Configuration\nAt the beginning of each training episode, the swarm was spawned in an obstacle-free region at the map center, with UAVs randomly positioned on a\n3\n×\n3\n3\\times 3\ngrid with 1.6m spacing to ensure safe initial separation. The goal point was randomly sampled on a 30m radius circle centered at the spawn region. To enhance policy robustness and generalization, we randomized initial UAV orientations, the leader’s speed, and goal location for each episode.\nTraining was conducted across 512 parallel environments for 500 million timesteps, leveraging GPU acceleration (Nvidia RTX 4090 and Intel i9-14900K) for efficient data collection and policy updates. Each episode terminated under four conditions: (1) collision between UAVs, (2) collision between a UAV and obstacle, (3) flying below minimum allowable altitude, and (4) flying above maximum allowable altitude, ensuring the policy learns to maintain swarm cohesion, avoid collisions, and preserve stable flight within operational constraints.\nIV-A\n2\nLeader Navigation\nThe leader UAV utilized a planner combining the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT)\n[\n34\n]\nwith the artificial potential field (APF)\n[\n35\n]\nfor real-time navigation. RRT generates a local path toward the waypoint to prevent APF from falling into local minima. Then, APF computes an attractive force toward the RRT-generated path direction and repulsive forces from nearby obstacles detected by the 360-degree LiDAR. The final velocity command is obtained by combining these APF forces, enabling the UAV to follow the RRT path while maintaining safe distances from obstacles. This integration allows smooth and safe navigation in unknown environments.\nIV-A\n3\nPerception Modeling\nWhile our physical system uses reflective tape for neighbor detection, in simulation we abstracted this process using the simulator’s ground-truth data to identify neighbors. This abstraction allowed us to focus training on the control policy while incorporating key perceptual challenges based on our hardware’s empirical characteristics: (1) estimation errors in relative neighbor states with Gaussian distributions (relative position:\nσ\npos\n=\n0.02\n\\sigma_{\\text{pos}}=0.02\nm, relative velocity:\nσ\nvel\n=\n0.05\n\\sigma_{\\text{vel}}=0.05\nm/s), (2) limited FOV identical to the physical sensor (\n−\n7\n∘\n-7^{\\circ}\nto\n52\n∘\n52^{\\circ}\nvertical), (3) occlusions calculated based on physical UAV dimensions, and (4) processing latency reflecting actual onboard computation. Latency was determined by measuring end-to-end delay on the onboard computer, from sensor data acquisition through our perception pipeline to policy input generation. To ensure temporal consistency, data synchronization introduces delays of 0.1s for ego state and LiDAR data for obstacles, and 0.2s for relative neighbor information.\nIV-B\nEvaluation Metrics\nTo quantitatively evaluate the proposed policy, six metrics were defined: success rate (\nSR\n), mission progress (\nMP\n), flock radius (\nFR\n), minimum separation (\nMS\n), alignment (\nAL\n), and minimum distance to obstacles (\nMDO\n). All results represent mean and standard deviation from 100 independent trials per scenario.\nIV-B\n1\nSuccess Rate (\nSR\n)\nThe percentage of trials where all UAVs successfully followed the leader to the destination without collisions, serving as the primary indicator of mission completion. Evaluation terminates when: (1) UAV-UAV collision, (2) UAV-obstacle collision, (3) flying below/above altitude limits, or (4) complete leader loss from all followers’ perception.\nSR\nis defined as\nSR\n=\nN\nsuccessful trials\nN\ntrials\n×\n100\n.\n\\text{{SR}}=\\frac{N_{\\text{successful trials}}}{N_{\\text{trials}}}\\times 100.\nIV-B\n2\nMission Progress (\nMP\n)\nThe ratio of distance advanced toward the destination relative to total distance from start to destination, averaged over all trials.

The first two are heuristic-based methods validated in real-world experiments. PACNav\n[\n22\n]\nis a bio-inspired distributed control method enabling collective navigation without GNSS or inter-UAV communication by introducing two metrics: path persistence (measuring how consistently a UAV flies straight) and path similarity (measuring directional consistency among neighbors). Uninformed UAVs identify reliable leaders by selecting neighbors exhibiting high path persistence and similarity, enabling emergent collective navigation toward unknown destinations. The method incorporates reactive collision avoidance for environmental obstacles and inter-UAV conflicts, validated with four UAVs in natural forests.\nThe second baseline employs a bio-inspired VPF\n[\n23\n]\n, which mimics avian visual perception for communication-free flocking. Instead of exchanging state information, each UAV uses VPF to observe neighbors and obstacles, distinguishing between repulsion zones (objects appearing large) and attraction zones (objects appearing small) based on perceived size. This enables the three fundamental flocking behaviors—separation, attraction, and velocity alignment—without inter-UAV communication. The approach incorporates an implicit heterogeneous flocking framework, where a small minority of informed UAVs guide the uninformed majority through emergent collective behavior, with uninformed agents following the swarm’s overall motion without explicitly identifying leaders. The method has been validated with six UAVs in indoor environments with obstacles, where a motion capture system was installed.\nFor the learning-based baseline, the DAgger approach\n[\n25\n]\ntrains an end-to-end visuomotor controller by imitating an expert policy combining modified Reynolds’ flocking rules with APF-based obstacle avoidance. The expert policy, which has access to ground-truth state information in simulation, generates optimal control commands that the student policy learns to replicate using only onboard camera images and IMU data. Through centralized training and decentralized execution, the learned policy achieves vision-only cooperative flight without GNSS or inter-UAV communication. While validated exclusively in high-fidelity Gazebo simulations with complex scenarios (pillar forests, narrow gaps), the method demonstrates superior learning efficiency and performance compared with other learning algorithms (MADDPG\n[\n17\n]\n, SAC\n[\n27\n]\n, and MAGAIL\n[\n36\n]\n). For our comparison, we directly implemented the expert policy itself rather than retraining the imitation learning policy. This design ensures fair comparison by eliminating approximation error from imitation learning, evaluating the fundamental control strategy rather than policy distillation quality, providing an upper bound on DAgger method’s performance.\nIV-C\n2\nFair Comparison Setup\nFor fair comparison, we unified all methods to use identical LiDAR-based perception (same FOV, range, occlusion handling) while preserving each method’s control strategy. Parameters were independently tuned to achieve similar flocking behavior in obstacle-free environments, ensuring equivalent baseline capability before testing in complex scenarios.\nTABLE IV:\nScalability analysis of the proposed DRL policy with varying numbers of follower UAVs\nMetric\nMin. obstacle gap\nNumber of followers\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\nSR\n(%)\nNo obstacles\n100.0\n±\n\\pm\n0.0\n100.0\n±\n\\pm\n0.0\n100.0\n±\n\\pm\n0.0\n98.0\n±\n\\pm\n0.0\n93.0\n±\n\\pm\n0.0\n10m\n100.0\n±\n\\pm\n0.0\n99.0\n±\n\\pm\n0.0\n96.0\n±\n\\pm\n0.0\n84.0\n±\n\\pm\n0.0\n70.0\n±\n\\pm\n0.0\n5m\n93.0\n±\n\\pm\n0.0\n97.0\n±\n\\pm\n0.0\n88.0\n±\n\\pm\n0.0\n56.0\n±\n\\pm\n0.0\n46.0\n±\n\\pm\n0.0\nMP\n(%)\nNo obstacles\n100.0\n±\n\\pm\n0.0\n100.0\n±\n\\pm\n0.0\n100.0\n±\n\\pm\n0.0\n99.2\n±\n\\pm\n7.5\n95.3\n±\n\\pm\n18.2\n10m\n100.0\n±\n\\pm\n0.0\n99.3\n±\n\\pm\n7.0\n97.7\n±\n\\pm\n12.8\n91.7\n±\n\\pm\n21.9\n88.5\n±\n\\pm\n23.4\n5m\n98.0\n±\n\\pm\n9.7\n99.5\n±\n\\pm\n3.3\n96.8\n±\n\\pm\n10.2\n79.6\n±\n\\pm\n22.9\n70.3\n±\n\\pm\n27.6\nFR\n(m)\nNo obstacles\n1.13\n±\n\\pm\n0.18\n1.61\n±\n\\pm\n0.13\n1.93\n±\n\\pm\n0.06\n2.15\n±\n\\pm\n0.06\n2.32\n±\n\\pm\n0.05\n10m\n1.08\n±\n\\pm\n0.15\n1.56\n±\n\\pm\n0.12\n1.88\n±\n\\pm\n0.06\n2.14\n±\n\\pm\n0.06\n2.33\n±\n\\pm\n0.06\n5m\n1.04\n±\n\\pm\n0.13\n1.47\n±\n\\pm\n0.09\n1.85\n±\n\\pm\n0.05\n2.12\n±\n\\pm\n0.05\n2.32\n±\n\\pm\n0.07\nMS\n(m)\nNo obstacles\n1.60\n±\n\\pm\n0.01\n1.55\n±\n\\pm\n0.02\n1.47\n±\n\\pm\n0.03\n1.39\n±\n\\pm\n0.02\n1.34\n±\n\\pm\n0.02\n10m\n1.60\n±\n\\pm\n0.01\n1.53\n±\n\\pm\n0.02\n1.46\n±\n\\pm\n0.03\n1.38\n±\n\\pm\n0.02\n1.34\n±\n\\pm\n0.02\n5m\n1.60\n±\n\\pm\n0.01\n1.51\n±\n\\pm\n0.02\n1.44\n±\n\\pm\n0.03\n1.37\n±\n\\pm\n0.02\n1.32\n±\n\\pm\n0.03\nAL\nNo obstacles\n0.97\n±\n\\pm\n0.02\n0.94\n±\n\\pm\n0.01\n0.89\n±\n\\pm\n0.02\n0.85\n±\n\\pm\n0.02\n0.84\n±\n\\pm\n0.04\n10m\n0.97\n±\n\\pm\n0.02\n0.94\n±\n\\pm\n0.01\n0.89\n±\n\\pm\n0.02\n0.85\n±\n\\pm\n0.02\n0.84\n±\n\\pm\n0.03\n5m\n0.97\n±\n\\pm\n0.02\n0.93\n±\n\\pm\n0.02\n0.88\n±\n\\pm\n0.02\n0.84\n±\n\\pm\n0.03\n0.83\n±\n\\pm\n0.04\nMDO\n(m)\nNo obstacles\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n10m\n2.45\n±\n\\pm\n0.13\n2.27\n±\n\\pm\n0.15\n2.17\n±\n\\pm\n0.18\n2.00\n±\n\\pm\n0.24\n1.68\n±\n\\pm\n0.29\n5m\n2.12\n±\n\\pm\n0.21\n1.88\n±\n\\pm\n0.16\n1.65\n±\n\\pm\n0.29\n1.49\n±\n\\pm\n0.37\n1.35\n±\n\\pm\n0.45\nIV-C\n3\nEvaluation Environments\nComparative evaluation was conducted with five UAVs (one leader and four followers) in various environments to verify generalization performance and robustness. First, evaluations were performed in the training environment with three obstacle density levels: none, sparse with minimum 10m gap, and dense with minimum 5m gap. Two new test environments were introduced: a simplified forest with irregularly distributed trees and rocks, and a more realistic complex forest featuring trees and rocks with detailed trunks and foliage as shown in Fig.\n6\n(b) and (c).\nFigure 7:\nExample trajectory of the proposed policy in the forest test environment with multiple waypoints. The swarm of five UAVs successfully navigates through dense obstacles by following the leader while maintaining cohesion. The leader sequentially visits four waypoints to reach the goal.\nIV-C\n4\nResults and Analysis\nAs shown in Table\nIII\n, the proposed DRL method consistently outperforms all baselines, with performance gaps widening in complex environments. All methods succeed without obstacles, but degrade sharply in cluttered scenarios (5–31% success in realistic forests), whereas our policy maintains 72% success and 88.2% mission progress. The proposed method achieves the most compact flock (smallest radius) and organized formation (highest alignment) while maintaining safe separation and obstacle distances, effectively balancing task completion, cohesion, and collision avoidance.\nBeyond quantitative evaluation with single goal points, Fig.\n7\ndemonstrates the proposed policy’s versatility in handling sequential waypoint navigation. The swarm successfully follows the leader through four waypoints in the forest test environment, maintaining cohesion and obstacle avoidance. This capability naturally emerges from the learned flocking behavior and obstacle avoidance, as followers implicitly follow the leader regardless of waypoint number or configuration.\nIV-D\nScalability Analysis\nTo evaluate the scalability of the proposed DRL policy, a single model trained with five UAVs (one leader and four followers) was tested by varying the number of followers from two to ten. Table\nIV\nillustrates performance variation with respect to follower count and environmental complexity.\nSuccess rate and mission progress decreased with increasing swarm size and environmental complexity, with significant degradation when eight or more followers navigated narrow gaps. This decline stems from a geometric constraint: the policy maintains similar altitudes for reliable neighbor detection within LiDAR’s limited vertical FOV (\n−\n7\n∘\n-7^{\\circ}\nto\n52\n∘\n52^{\\circ}\n), causing horizontal rather than vertical formation expansion. With 10 followers, the flock radius reaches 2.32m (total diameter  4.6m), making navigation through 5m gaps physically challenging. This tight margin between swarm size and obstacle spacing causes high failure rates in large-scale swarms.\nFlock radius increased with swarm size regardless of environment, while minimum separation and alignment decreased. Reduced separation implies higher collision risk, and decreased alignment reveals a key limitation of decentralized control: difficulty achieving directional consensus in large swarms without communication. The policy demonstrates moderate scalability but degrades due to geometric constraints, suggesting that robust large-scale application requires policies that better utilize three-dimensional space.\nIV-E\nAblation Studies\nIV-E\n1\nEffect of Reward Components\nWe validated each reward term by systematically removing components and evaluating six configurations: (1) without flocking reward, (2) without obstacle avoidance, (3) without stable flight, (4) without neighbor perception, (5) uniform weights, and (6) proposed method with tuned weights.

Without cohesion incentives, followers cannot establish leader-following behavior, demonstrating this reward is fundamentally essential for implicit coordination in communication-free settings.\nRemoving obstacle avoidance shows minor degradation in simple environments (96% success rate) but drops to 86% in dense scenarios, indicating explicit guidance significantly improves robustness despite some learning through collision penalties. The stable flight reward proves critical—its removal causes catastrophic failure (11%, 9%, and 3% success rates) as followers drift in altitude, losing neighbors outside LiDAR’s limited FOV (\n−\n7\n∘\n-7^{\\circ}\nto\n52\n∘\n52^{\\circ}\n), with increased flock radius (2.94m to 3.60m) and erratic flight patterns. This highlights altitude consistency as prerequisite for effective coordination with limited FOV sensors.\nThe neighbor perception reward shows environment-dependent importance, with minimal impact in simple scenarios (99% and 96%) but significant drops to 67% in dense environments, suggesting visibility mechanisms become critical as occlusion increases. Uniform weights achieve moderate performance (82%, 74%, and 54%) but consistently underperform the proposed method (100%, 99%, and 97%). These results validate each component’s distinct role: flocking enables leader-following, obstacle avoidance ensures safety, stable flight maintains controllability, and perception enhances robustness, with tuned weights effectively balancing these competing objectives.\nIV-E\n2\nEffect of Observable Neighbors\nTo determine the appropriate number of observable neighbors, we performed an ablation study using eleven UAVs (one leader and ten followers) across environments with varying complexity. The results, shown in Fig.\n8\n, indicate a clear trend: while increasing the number of neighbors generally improves success rate, performance gains diminish after a certain point.\nIn the obstacle-free environment, success rate saturated at 94% with only four neighbors, showing no further improvement with additional information. In more challenging environments with obstacles, a larger number of neighbors proved beneficial, though a noticeable slowdown in performance gains was observed. For instance, in the dense obstacles environment (5m spacing), increasing observable neighbors from five to six yielded a substantial 20% increase in success rate (from 26% to 46%). In contrast, further increasing from six to ten provided only a marginal 4% gain (from 46% to 50%), after which performance showed no significant improvement.\nFigure 8:\nAn effect of observable neighbors on success rate in collective navigation.\nThis analysis reveals that\n|\n𝒩\n|\n=\n6\n|\\mathcal{N}|=6\nis a critical threshold capturing the majority of performance benefits from situational awareness, particularly in complex scenarios. Beyond this number, marginal gains in success rate are outweighed by increased computational cost. Specifically, each additional neighbor contributes new data points, and the computational load of the object tracker, which scales quadratically (\nO\n​\n(\nn\n2\n)\nO(n^{2})\n) with the number of points\nn\nn\n, becomes a significant bottleneck on onboard embedded systems. Therefore, setting observable neighbors to six provides balance, ensuring high performance across various environments without imposing unnecessary computational burdens on the agents.\nFigure 9:\nHardware and system overview.

(c), (g), (k) Minimum separation and (d), (h), (l) Minimum distance to obstacles over time, respectively.\nV-A\nSystem Overview\nWe used custom 250 mm quadrotors equipped with a Livox Mid-360 LiDAR, an Nvidia Jetson Orin NX, and a Pixhawk 6C flight controller as shown in Fig.\n9\n. To ensure the UAV is detectable from any angle, reflective tape was affixed to all sides of its body. All computation, including FAST-LIO2\n[\n37\n]\nfor ego-pose estimation, an object tracker for neighbor detection and tracking, point downsampling, and neural network inference, was performed onboard.\nV-B\nPerformance of LiDAR-based detection\nWe evaluated the LiDAR-based detection performance under various conditions. The number of LiDAR returns decreases inversely with the square of the distance, and beyond approximately 10 m the low point density prevented reliable detection for our UAV size. In addition, the reflective tape’s intensity drops sharply at incident angles greater than about 45 degrees, leading to missed detections due to insufficient intensity. To address these limitations, reflective tape was affixed to all sides of the UAV.\nDetection rate is defined as the proportion of instances in which a UAV present in the scene is successfully detected by the LiDAR and precision represents the proportion of LiDAR detections that correspond to actual UAVs. Excluding cases where neighboring UAVs were outside the LiDAR’s FOV, our experiments demonstrated a detection rate of 100% and a precision of 99.2%, measured as the ratio of correctly detected instances across all time steps.\nV-C\nExperimental Results\nTo validate the sim-to-real transfer, we conducted experiments in controlled indoor and unstructured outdoor environments, with results in Fig.\n10\n, Fig.\n11\n, and Table\nVI\n. The results presented for each environment were obtained from a single trial, where the reported metrics represent the temporal mean and standard deviation over the entire episode length. The successful sim-to-real transfer of our policy was clearly demonstrated in diverse real-world environments. In indoor trials, the swarm successfully navigated cluttered obstacles while maintaining robust cohesion and separation. The low alignment scores observed were a direct result of confined space, which necessitated frequent maneuvering for collision avoidance. Both the minimum separation between agents and minimum distance to obstacles consistently remained above the collision distance threshold throughout all experiments, ensuring safe navigation without any collisions. Meanwhile, in outdoor scenarios with unpredictable variables such as wind and varying lighting conditions, the swarm demonstrated robust performance with these safety margins maintained across diverse obstacle configurations. The short forest scenario presented the most challenging obstacle avoidance conditions due to its dense vegetation, yet the policy successfully maintained collision-free navigation. The higher alignment scores in open areas suggest the policy adaptively transitions to a more organized and efficient formation when space allows. Collectively, these results validate that the single policy exhibits excellent generalization and robustness under complex and various real-world conditions.\nTABLE VI:\nReal-world experiment results with five UAVs\nMetric\nIndoor environments\nOutdoor environments\nCluttered blocks\nWall\nPillars\nDisplay tower\nShort forest\nFR\n(m)\n2.31\n±\n\\pm\n0.28\n2.54\n±\n\\pm\n0.28\n2.86\n±\n\\pm\n0.53\n2.60\n±\n\\pm\n0.27\n2.30\n±\n\\pm\n0.30\nMS\n(m)\n1.50\n±\n\\pm\n0.28\n1.39\n±\n\\pm\n0.36\n1.34\n±\n\\pm\n0.34\n1.55\n±\n\\pm\n0.16\n1.36\n±\n\\pm\n0.27\nAL\n0.48\n±\n\\pm\n0.40\n0.52\n±\n\\pm\n0.42\n0.72\n±\n\\pm\n0.34\n0.81\n±\n\\pm\n0.21\n0.74\n±\n\\pm\n0.30\nMDO\n(m)\n1.88\n±\n\\pm\n0.92\n4.25\n±\n\\pm\n1.45\n2.82\n±\n\\pm\n1.83\n5.82\n±\n\\pm\n4.69\n1.57\n±\n\\pm\n1.13\nVI\nConclusions\nThis paper introduced a fully communication-free system for collective UAV swarm navigation using a single LiDAR and a DRL policy. Our implicit leader-follower framework, enabled by a robust perception pipeline and a learned controller, allows a swarm to perform complex navigation in communication-denied environments. We rigorously validated our approach through extensive simulations and challenging real-world experiments. The DRL-based policy outperformed existing methods in simulation and demonstrated successful sim-to-real transfer, with a five-UAV swarm navigating diverse indoor and outdoor environments. This study validated the practicality and robustness of using DRL for communication-free collective navigation.\nFuture work will focus on enhancing scalability to larger swarms and exploring more complex collective behaviors like adaptive role-switching.\nAuthor Contributions\nMyong-Yol Choi: Conceptualization, project administration, investigation, methodology, software, validation, data curation, formal analysis, visualization, and writing—original draft.\nHankyoul Ko: Investigation, software, validation, data curation, formal analysis, and visualization.\nHanse Cho: Investigation, data curation, and formal analysis.\nChangseung Kim, Seunghwan Kim, and Jaemin Seo: Investigation.\nHyondong Oh: Supervision, funding acquisition, resources, and writing—review and editing.\nReferences\n[1]\nD. Floreano and R. J.

    "preview_text": "This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based controller for collective navigation of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms in communication-denied environments, enabling robust operation in complex, obstacle-rich environments. Inspired by biological swarms where informed individuals guide groups without explicit communication, we employ an implicit leader-follower framework. In this paradigm, only the leader possesses goal information, while follower UAVs learn robust policies using only onboard LiDAR sensing, without requiring any inter-agent communication or leader identification. Our system utilizes LiDAR point clustering and an extended Kalman filter for stable neighbor tracking, providing reliable perception independent of external positioning systems. The core of our approach is a DRL controller, trained in GPU-accelerated Nvidia Isaac Sim, that enables followers to learn complex emergent behaviors - balancing flocking and obstacle avoidance - using only local perception. This allows the swarm to implicitly follow the leader while robustly addressing perceptual challenges such as occlusion and limited field-of-view. The robustness and sim-to-real transfer of our approach are confirmed through extensive simulations and challenging real-world experiments with a swarm of five UAVs, which successfully demonstrated collective navigation across diverse indoor and outdoor environments without any communication or external localization.\n\nCommunication-Free Collective Navigation for a Swarm of UAVs\nvia LiDAR-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning\nMyong-Yol Choi, Hankyoul Ko, Hanse Cho, Changseung Kim, Seunghwan Kim, Jaemin Seo,\nand Hyondong Oh\nThis research was supported by Theater Defense Research Center funded by Defense Acquisition Program Administration under Grant UD200043CD, National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (2023R1A2C2003130), and Unmanned Vehicles Core Technology Research and Development Program t",

            "answer": "## 论文核心分析\n\n### **一、 研究问题**\n论文旨在解决**通信受限/拒止环境**下无人机集群的**集体导航**问题。具体挑战包括：\n- **无通信**：无人机之间不能交换任何状态、目标或身份信息。\n- **无外部定位**：不依赖GNSS或运动捕捉系统等外部基础设施。\n- **感知受限**：仅使用机载传感器（文中为LiDAR），且面临遮挡、有限视场等现实问题。\n- **信息不对称**：只有少数“领导者”无人机知晓目标点，大量“跟随者”既不知道目标，也无法识别谁是领导者。\n\n### **二、 核心创新点**\n论文提出了一个**完全无需通信的LiDAR-深度强化学习集群导航系统**，其创新性主要体现在以下三个紧密关联的方面：\n\n1.  **全通信自由的LiDAR感知框架**\n    - **技术**：采用单一360度扫描LiDAR，通过**反射带**产生高强度点云，结合**DBSCAN聚类**和**扩展卡尔曼滤波跟踪**，实现稳定、光照不变的邻居检测与跟踪。\n    - **创新**：摒弃了视觉方案对光照的依赖和多相机系统的复杂性，提供了一种更可靠、计算效率更高的机载感知方案，且**完全不依赖任何机间通信**。\n\n2.  **基于DRL的隐式领导者-跟随者控制策略**\n    - **技术**：采用**近端策略优化算法**训练跟随者无人机的策略。策略输入**仅包含**自身运动状态（速度、姿态）、局部感知的邻居状态（相对位置、速度）和LiDAR生成的障碍物占据栅格，**刻意排除了全局位置信息**以增强泛化能力。\n    - **创新**：\n        - **隐式跟随**：跟随者通过DRL学习“聚集”与“避障”的平衡行为，从而**自发地**跟随邻居群体移动。由于领导者向目标运动，整个集群便被“牵引”至目的地。**无需识别领导者，也无需知晓目标**。\n        - **奖励函数设计**：精心设计的多目标奖励函数（聚集、避障、稳定飞行、邻居感知），驱动智能体学习在复杂感知约束下（如遮挡、垂直视场有限）的鲁棒协同行为。\n\n3.  **全面的仿真到现实验证**\n    - **技术**：在GPU加速的Nvidia Isaac Sim中进行大规模并行训练（5亿步），并在**室内外多种真实复杂环境**中，使用**五架无人机集群**进行了成功验证。\n    - **创新**：据作者所知，这是**首个**在真实世界中验证的、基于LiDAR和DRL的、完全无需信息交换的无人机集群集体导航系统。证明了方法的**实际可行性与强鲁棒性**。\n\n### **三、 解决方案架构**\n论文通过一个**去中心化架构**整合了上述创新点，解决问题：\n\n1.  **感知层**：每个无人机独立运行LiDAR惯性里程计和对象跟踪器，实时输出自身状态、邻居列表和障碍物信息。\n2.  **决策层**：\n    - **领导者**：使用传统的局部规划器（RRT+人工势场）结合已知航点进行导航。\n    - **跟随者**：将感知层输出的**局部观察**输入到**训练好的DRL策略网络**中，网络直接输出速度指令。\n3.  **涌现的集体行为**：每个跟随者独立执行基于局部观察的策略，为了获得“聚集”奖励而试图保持在邻居附近。当领导者向目标移动时，这种局部聚集行为像波纹一样传递，使得整个集群**涌现出**集体向目标导航的全局智能，而无需任何显式的全局协调或通信。\n\n### **四、 实际价值**\n- **军事/安防**：在电子对抗、通信干扰或保密要求高的场景下，实现可靠的集群侦察、监视与突击。\n- **灾难响应**：在通信基础设施损毁的灾区（如地震、洪水），集群可进入执行搜救、评估任务。\n- **工业巡检**：在GPS信号弱的大型设施（如矿山、林场、工厂）内部，实现自动化协同巡检。\n- **学术贡献**：为通信拒止环境下的自主集群研究提供了一个从感知、控制到验证的完整技术范式，证明了DRL在解决复杂、现实集群协同问题上的巨大潜力。",

[19]**: 使用单目相机和圆形图案在无GPS环境下进行相对定位。**改进**：首次实现了无通信、无GPS的相对感知。\n    - **Schilling et al. [20, 21]**: 使用多个全景相机，无需标记即可实现室外编队。**改进**：摆脱了人工标记，提高了自然场景适应性。\n    - **VPF方法 [23]**: 模仿鸟类视觉投影场，通过感知物体大小判断吸引/排斥区域。**改进**：提供了更生物启发的感知-控制接口。\n- **局限性**:\n    - **光照敏感**：在强光、阴影或黑暗下性能下降。\n    - **尺度模糊**：单目视觉需额外运动或处理来估计深度。\n    - **系统复杂**：全景感知需多个相机，带来巨大的计算负载、校准和同步难题。\n\n**2. LiDAR感知兴起期**\n- **代表工作**: **Swarm-LIO2 [24]**。\n- **改进点**:\n    - **光照不变性**：LiDAR性能不受光照条件影响。\n    - **直接深度测量**：解决了单目视觉的尺度模糊问题。\n    - **单传感器全景**：一个360°旋转LiDAR即可实现全景感知，极大降低了系统复杂度和计算负担。\n    - **反射带标记**：通过在高反射带上粘贴反射带，在LiDAR反射强度测量中产生独特的强回波，实现了可靠的邻居检测。\n- **局限性**：Swarm-LIO2主要贡献在于**去中心化的状态估计和邻居检测**，其**控制部分仍依赖于传统的势场或规则方法**，在复杂动态环境中可能陷入局部最优或表现僵化。\n\n**3. 本文的感知改进**\n- **继承与深化**：完全继承了Swarm-LIO2的LiDAR+反射带感知思路。\n- **系统化与鲁棒性增强**：提出了一个完整的、模块化的机载感知流水线（图3），包括：\n    - **点云过滤**：基于距离和反射强度（`I_high`阈值）筛选。\n    - **聚类与跟踪**：使用**DBSCAN**进行自适应密度聚类，结合**扩展卡尔曼滤波**进行平滑跟踪。\n    - **集群验证**：基于高反射点比例和持续时间的双重验证，确保检测可靠性。\n- **实际价值**：该感知系统在真实实验中达到了**100%的检测率**和**99.2%的精确率**，为后续DRL控制策略提供了**稳定、可靠的局部观测输入**，是仿真到现实迁移成功的关键基础。\n\n#### 发展方向二：控制策略的演进 —— 从规则到学习\n\n**1. 启发式规则控制**\n- **代表理论**：Reynolds三原则 [4] (分离、聚合、对齐)，Olfati-Saber的势场法 [6]。\n- **改进点**：提供了无需通信的分布式协调理论基础。\n- **局限性**：\n    - **泛化能力差**：手动设计的规则难以适应多变的环境（障碍物密度、集群规模）。\n    - **易陷入局部最优**：如势场法中的“死锁”问题。\n    - **行为僵化**：无法自适应调整以应对动态的集群构型。\n\n**2. 模仿学习**\n- **代表工作**: **Schilling et al. [20], DAgger [25]**。\n- **改进点**：通过模仿专家演示（通常是规则算法的输出），**部分缓解了规则设计的僵化问题**，能从数据中学习更复杂的映射关系。\n- **局限性**：\n    - **受限于专家数据**：专家演示的质量和覆盖范围决定了策略的上限。\n    - **获取数据困难**：在通信无感知、局部可观的复杂场景下，获取高质量的专家演示本身极具挑战。\n\n**3. 深度强化学习**\n- **早期探索**: **Huang et al. [26], Bai et al. [27]**。\n- **改进点**：DRL通过与环境直接交互进行优化，**无需手动设计规则或依赖专家数据**，能自动学习平衡竞争性目标（聚合、避障）的策略。\n- **局限性**：\n    - **验证场景简单**：大多在**无障碍或已知障碍的仿真**中验证，与现实差距大。\n    - **感知建模简化**：未充分考虑真实传感器的局限（如视场角限制、遮挡、噪声）。\n    - **缺乏真实世界验证**：仿真到现实的鸿沟未被跨越。\n\n**4. 本文的控制策略改进**\n- **基于DRL的全面深化**：\n    - **精心设计的观察与动作空间**：观察包含自我状态、最多6个邻居的相对状态（采用**拓扑邻域**而非度量邻域思想）以及一个两通道的LiDAR占据栅格。**关键设计**：**故意排除绝对位置**作为输入，迫使策略学习基于自身运动和周围环境的**自我中心策略**，极大增强了泛化能力。\n    - **多目标奖励函数**：设计了包含**集群奖励**（分离与聚合）、**障碍物避让奖励**、**稳定飞行奖励**、**邻居感知奖励**和**碰撞惩罚**的复合奖励函数（图5）。**关键创新**：引入了**邻居感知奖励**，鼓励智能体将邻居保持在有限的LiDAR视场角内，并设计了在丢失所有邻居时的**紧急下降恢复机制**，直接针对真实传感器的局限性进行优化。\n    - **大规模并行训练**：在Nvidia Isaac Sim中使用512个并行环境进行5亿步训练，利用GPU加速，使策略能充分探索复杂状态空间。\n- **摒弃速度对齐项**：为了适应隐式领导-跟随场景（领导者可能任意机动，跟随者无法识别领导者），**主动放弃了传统的速度对齐规则**。这使得跟随者能更灵活地响应领导者的位置变化，而不是被邻居的平均速度方向束缚。\n- **首次实现真实世界验证**：本文最大的突破在于将训练好的单一策略**零样本迁移**到真实五架无人机上，在多样化的室内外复杂环境中成功完成了集体导航任务，证明了其**卓越的仿真到现实迁移能力和鲁棒性**。\n\n---\n\n### 总结：本文工作的定位与核心贡献\n\n本文站在了前述两个发展方向的交汇点上，并实现了关键性突破：\n\n1.  **感知层面**：采纳并强化了**LiDAR+反射带**这一最鲁棒、最实用的通信无感知方案，构建了工程上可靠的感知流水线。\n2.  **控制层面**：利用**深度强化学习**，设计出能自动平衡多目标、并专门针对真实感知约束（遮挡、有限FOV）进行优化的高级策略。\n3.  **系统整合与验证**：首次将鲁棒的LiDAR感知系统与DRL控制策略深度融合，形成一个完整的、端到端的通信无",

            "answer": "## 论文评价指标与数据集分析\n\n该论文通过**仿真**和**真实世界实验**对提出的方法进行了全面验证。其评价体系不依赖于传统意义上的静态“数据集”，而是通过**在特定环境中运行大量仿真试验和物理飞行试验**来收集性能数据。以下是其使用的评价指标和“数据”来源的详细分析。\n\n### 一、 评价指标详情\n论文定义了六个核心定量指标，用于从不同维度评估集群导航的性能。所有指标均在多次独立试验（通常为100次）中计算均值和标准差。\n\n| 指标名称 | 缩写 | 计算公式 / 定义 | 评估目的与细节 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **成功率** | SR | \\( SR = \\frac{N_{\\text{successful trials}}}{N_{\\text{trials}}} \\times 100 \\) | **核心任务完成指标**。一次试验成功的条件是：整个集群（所有无人机）在**无碰撞**（与障碍物或其他无人机）的情况下，成功跟随领航者抵达目标点。试验终止条件包括：碰撞、飞行高度超限、或所有跟随者完全丢失对领航者的感知。 |\n| **任务进度** | MP | \\( MP = \\frac{1}{N_{\\text{trials}}} \\sum_{k=1}^{N_{\\text{trials}}} \\left[ \\left(1 - \\frac{\\|P_{\\text{end}}^k - P_{\\text{goal}}\\|_2}{\\|P_{\\text{start}} - P_{\\text{goal}}\\|_2} \\right) \\times 100 \\right] \\) | **评估导航效率**。衡量集群向目标点前进的平均进度比例。即使任务失败（如中途碰撞），该指标也能反映失败前已完成的进度，比单纯的二值成功率提供更细粒度的性能信息。 |\n| **集群半径** | FR | \\( FR = \\frac{1}{N_{\\text{trials}}} \\sum_{k=1}^{N_{\\text{trials}}} \\left[ \\frac{1}{T_k} \\sum_{t=1}^{T_k} \\max_{i=1,\\dots,N} \\|\\mathbf{p}_t^{i,k} - \\mathbf{p}_t^{c,k}\\|_2 \\right] \\) | **评估集群紧凑度与凝聚力**。计算整个任务过程中，距离集群中心最远的无人机的平均距离。较小的FR值表明集群保持紧凑，这对于在通信缺失下维持局部感知和协同至关重要。值过大会增加跟随者丢失邻居感知的风险。 |\n| **最小间隔** | MS | \\( MS = \\frac{1}{N_{\\text{trials}}} \\sum_{k=1}^{N_{\\text{trials}}} \\left[ \\frac{1}{T_k} \\sum_{t=1}^{T_k} \\min_{i \\neq j} \\|\\mathbf{p}_t^{i,k} - \\mathbf{p}_t^{j,k}\\|_2 \\right] \\) | **评估集群内部安全性**。衡量整个任务过程中，任意两架无人机之间距离的最小值的平均值。这是**防碰撞**的直接度量，必须始终大于无人机的物理尺寸（文中无人机半径 \\( r_{uav} = 0.2m \\)）。 |\n| **对齐度** | AL | \\( AL = \\frac{1}{N_{\\text{trials}}} \\sum_{k=1}^{N_{\\text{trials}}} \\left[ \\frac{1}{T_k} \\sum_{t=1}^{T_k} \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_t^{i,k} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_t^{\\text{avg},k}}{\\|\\mathbf{v}_t^{i,k}\\|_2 \\|\\mathbf{v}_t^{\\text{avg},k}\\|_2} \\right] \\) | **评估运动方向一致性**。计算每个无人机速度方向与集群平均速度方向之间余弦相似度的平均值。值越接近1，表明集群运动方向越一致，飞行越有序。**论文特意在奖励函数中未加入速度对齐项**，因此这个指标用于观察 emergent 行为是否自然产生了对齐。 |\n| **最小障碍物距离** | MDO | \\( MDO = \\frac{1}{N_{\\text{trials}}} \\sum_{k=1}^{N_{\\text{trials}}} \\left[ \\frac{1}{T_k} \\sum_{t=1}^{T_k} \\min_{\\substack{i=1,\\dots,N \\\\ m=1,\\dots,M}} \\|\\mathbf{p}_t^{i,k} - \\mathbf{o}_t^{m,k}\\|_2 \\right] \\) | **评估外部环境安全性**。衡量整个任务过程中，任何无人机与任何被感知到的障碍物点之间距离的最小值的平均值。这是**避障**性能的直接度量，值越大表明安全裕度越高。 |\n\n### 二、 “数据集”/实验环境详情\n论文的性能数据来源于在**多种仿真环境和真实物理环境**中进行的系统性试验，而非一个预录制的静态数据集。\n\n#### 1. 仿真训练与测试环境\n- **训练环境**：\n    - **场景**：一个中心有生成区域、周围随机分布**柱状障碍物**的场地（如图6a）。\n    - **数据生成方式**：在Nvidia Isaac Sim中使用**512个并行环境**进行GPU加速训练，共采集**5亿个时间步**的数据。\n    - **随机化**：每个训练回合（episode）随机化以下要素以提升策略鲁棒性：\n        - 无人机初始位置（在3x3网格内）、初始朝向。\n        - 障碍物（柱子）的位置。\n        - 目标点位置（在以生成区为中心、半径30米的圆上随机采样）。\n        - 领航者速度。\n\n- **测试环境**（用于评估泛化能力）：\n    | 环境名称 | 障碍物描述 | 最小间隙 | 测试目的 |\n    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n    | **无障碍物** | 空旷场地 | 无 | 基线性能，验证基础集群跟随能力。 |\n    | **训练环境（稀疏）** | 随机柱子 | 10米 | 在熟悉但简单的障碍环境中测试。 |\n    | **训练环境（密集）** | 随机柱子 | 5米 | 在熟悉但复杂的障碍环境中测试。 |\n    | **简化森林** | 不规则分布的树木和岩石模型（图6b） | 5米 | 在**未见过的**、更自然的障碍布局中测试泛化能力。 |\n    | **复杂森林** | 带有详细树干和树叶的树木、岩石模型（图6c） | 5米 | 在**未见过的**、高度复杂和真实的障碍环境中测试极限泛化能力。 |\n\n#### 2. 真实世界实验环境\n论文在**5个不同的物理场景**中进行了验证，使用**5架**定制无人机（1领航，4跟随）。这些实验构成了最关键的“测试集”，证明了**仿真到现实（Sim-to-Real）** 的有效性。\n\n| 环境类型 | 场景名称 | 环境特点与挑战 | 验证目的 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **室内** | 1. 杂乱方块 | 由纸箱构成的密集、结构化障碍。 | 在受控但复杂的几何环境中测试避障和集群保持。 |\n| | 2. 墙壁 | 具有长直墙面的通道环境。 | 测试在大型平面障碍前的群体行为。 |\n| **室外** | 3. 柱子 | 由真实柱子构成的类似仿真训练的环境。 | 测试从仿真到相似现实环境的直接转移。 |\n| | 4. 展示塔 | 开阔场地中有大型独立障碍物。 | 测试在开放空间和孤立障碍下的行为。 |\n| | 5. 矮树林 | 真实的、植被密集的森林区域（最具挑战性）。 | 测试在**完全非结构化、复杂**自然环境中的鲁棒性、避障和感知能力。 |\n\n### 总结\n该论文采用了一套**多层次、多维度的评估体系**：\n- **指标**：涵盖了**任务完成度（SR, MP）、安全性（MS, MDO）、集群质量（FR, AL）** 等关键方面。\n- **数据来源**：通过在**高度随机化的仿真环境**中进行大规模并行训练和系统测试，以及在**多样化的真实室内外场景**中进行物理验证来获得性能数据。这种评估方法不仅证明了算法的绝对性能（通过对比基线），更重要的是证明了其**强大的泛化能力和仿真到现实的迁移能力**，这是该研究实际价值的关键体现。",

            "question": "论文的主要局限性有哪些？未来可能的改进方向是什么？",
            "answer": "## 论文主要局限性分析\n\n基于对论文内容的深入分析，本文提出的通信自由无人机集群导航系统虽然取得了显著成果，但仍存在以下主要局限性：\n\n### 1. **感知系统的物理限制**\n    - **检测距离有限**：LiDAR点云密度随距离平方反比下降，在约10米外难以可靠检测无人机大小的目标，限制了集群的物理扩展范围。\n    - **视角依赖性**：反射胶带在入射角大于约45度时反射强度急剧下降，可能导致漏检。尽管通过全向粘贴胶带缓解，但极端角度下仍存在挑战。\n    - **垂直视场（FOV）狭窄**：LiDAR垂直FOV仅为-7°至52°，限制了无人机在高度方向上的机动空间，迫使集群在相近高度飞行，影响了三维队形的灵活性。\n\n### 2. **策略与系统的可扩展性瓶颈**\n    - **几何约束导致规模上限**：如**表IV**所示，当跟随者数量增至8个或以上时，在5米窄隙环境中的成功率显著下降（例如，10个跟随者时成功率仅46%）。这是因为策略倾向于保持相近高度以维持邻居检测，导致队形在水平方向扩张。集群直径接近障碍间隙时，导航变得极其困难。\n    - **去中心化共识困难**：随着集群规模增大，对齐度（`AL`）下降，表明在没有通信的情况下，大规模集群难以达成运动方向的一致共识。\n    - **计算负载**：邻居跟踪模块的计算复杂度随点数呈`O(n²)`增长，对机载嵌入式系统构成负担，限制了可实时处理的邻居数量上限（论文选定为6个是基于性能与负载的权衡）。\n\n### 3. **学习策略的泛化边界**\n    - **环境与集群规模泛化**：策略在训练环境（5架无人机、柱状障碍）中表现优异，但在更复杂的“森林”测试环境或更大规模集群中性能有所衰减（如**表III**中森林环境成功率72%）。这表明策略学习到的行为可能仍未完全覆盖所有现实世界的复杂交互。\n    - **动态角色与任务**：当前框架严格区分**固定**的“领导者”（有目标信息）和“跟随者”（无目标信息）。系统无法处理领导者失效、角色动态切换或任务在线重分配等场景。\n\n### 4. **依赖特定硬件配置**\n    - **反射标识依赖**：系统依赖于无人机机身上的**反射胶带**来实现可靠的邻居检测。这增加了部署前的准备要求，且胶带可能磨损、污损，影响性能。\n    - **同构假设**：所有跟随者无人机被假定为具有相同的传感器（Livox Mid-360 LiDAR）和计算平台（Jetson Orin NX），在异构集群中应用可能需要重新调整或训练。\n\n---\n\n## 未来可能的改进方向\n\n针对上述局限性，论文在结论部分已简要提及，并可延伸出以下具体改进方向：\n\n### 1. **增强感知能力与鲁棒性**\n    - **多传感器融合**：结合轻量化的视觉或毫米波雷达，补偿LiDAR在特定角度、距离或天气（如雾、尘）下的不足，提升全天候、全向检测能力。\n    - **无标识（Marker-Free）检测**：利用深度学习模型直接从原始点云中识别并跟踪无人机形状，消除对反射胶带的依赖，提高系统的通用性和部署便捷性。\n    - **扩展垂直机动性**：改进策略奖励函数或网络结构，鼓励集群在安全前提下更有效地利用三维空间，以缓解狭窄垂直FOV带来的约束。\n\n### 2. **提升系统可扩展性与适应性**\n    - **分层或分簇控制**：对于大规模集群，引入分层组织架构。局部小组内部紧密跟随，小组之间维持松散联系，从而降低全局协调的复杂性。\n    - **通信辅助的混合架构**：在通信可用但不可靠的场景中，研究**最小化通信**的策略，例如仅在最关键时刻（如即将丢失邻居、穿越极端狭窄通道）交换少量状态信息，以提升大规模集群的鲁棒性而不违背“通信拒止”的核心前提。\n    - **自适应邻居数量**：使策略能动态调整其关注的邻居数量，而不是固定为6个，以更好地适应不同密度和规模的集群状态。\n\n### 3. **强化学习策略的进阶**\n    - **课程学习与更复杂的环境**：在训练中引入渐进式更复杂的环境（如动态障碍、更复杂的森林地貌、风雨扰动）和更大的集群规模，以提升策略的泛化能力。\n    - **元学习或终身学习**：使无人机能够在部署后，通过少量在线经验快速适应新环境或新的集群队友，实现持续学习。\n    - **动态角色分配**：研究如何使集群中的个体能够**基于局部感知**，自主涌现出领导角色或在领导者失效时接替领导，实现真正的**自组织**与**弹性**。\n\n### 4. **探索更复杂的集体行为**\n    - **协同任务执行**：超越单纯的集体导航，研究在通信拒止环境下，如何实现**协同搜索、包围、载荷投递**等复杂任务。这需要将目标信息或任务状态以某种方式编码在领导者的运动模式中，并被跟随者通过感知解码。\n    - **异构集群协同**：将系统扩展至包含不同传感器配置、机动能力或功能的异构无人机集群，研究如何发挥各自优势完成共同任务。\n\n### 总结\n本文的工作为通信拒止环境下的无人机集群导航奠定了坚实的技术基础。**未来的核心挑战在于如何突破当前感知物理限制和固定角色架构，向更灵活、更可扩展、更智能的自组织集群系统演进**。这需要感知、控制、学习等多个领域的交叉创新。",
