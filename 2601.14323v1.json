The rapid advancement of these models, combined with the availability of large-scale crowd-sourced robotic datasets\n(Open X-Embodiment Collaboration,\n2024\n)\n, is accelerating the deployment of VLA systems in safety-critical domains including healthcare, manufacturing, and domestic service robotics.\nDespite the growing deployment of VLAs, their security remain underexplored. Existing backdoor attacks\n(Zhou\net al.\n,\n2025a\n,\nb\n; Xu\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\ntypically induce abrupt malicious behaviors, such as sudden gripper releases or incorrect target redirection. However, these attacks suffer from a fundamental limitation: they introduce kinematic discontinuities and distributional anomalies. Such irregularities are easily flagged by standard trajectory validation filters\n(Biagiotti and Melchiorri,\n2008\n)\nor human quality assurance, severely limiting the practical viability of existing methods in rigorous deployment environments (see Fig.\n1\nTop).\nIn this paper, we identify an overlooked security vulnerability arising from architectural design choices in VLA systems\nBlack\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\n. Specifically, state-of-the-art VLA models\nBlack\net al.\n(\n2024\n); Team (\n2025\n); Wang\net al.\n(\n2025\n)\nemploy action chunking\n(Zhao\net al.\n,\n2023\n)\n—predicting sequences of\nK\nK\nfuture actions rather than single steps—combined with delta pose representations\n(Zech\net al.\n,\n2019\n)\nthat encode relative position changes.\nThis design creates an\nintra-chunk visual open-loop\n: during the execution of a\nK\nK\n-step chunk, the robot blindly integrates predicted actions with less intermediate correction (see Fig.\n2\n).\nConsequently, even a negligible per-step perturbation integrates over the chunk leads to inevitable manipulation failure (e.g., a mere 1mm drift compounds to a 5cm deviation over a\nK\n=\n50\nK=50\nchunk).\nWe introduce\nSilent\nDrift\n, a stealthy black-box backdoor attack framework that exploits this action chunking vulnerability through two synergistic mechanisms.\nFirst, to evade dynamics-based anomaly detection, we construct perturbations using the Smootherstep function\n(Perlin,\n2002\n)\n. This quintic polynomial guarantees\nC\n2\nC^{2}\ncontinuity with zero velocity and acceleration at trajectory boundaries, ensuring the poisoned motion profiles are indistinguishable from legitimate demonstrations to standard dynamics-based detectors (see Fig.\n1\nBottom).\nSecond, we propose a keyframe attack strategy that selectively poisons only the critical approach phase. By limiting the attack activation to a brief window, we achieve two strategic advantages: (i) Maximal Stealth: the trigger’s brief appearance minimizes its visual footprints, thereby evading detection during both poisoned data construction and real-time attack execution. (ii) Irreversible Failure: injecting drift at this “point of no return” ensures the robot commits to a corrupted action chunk precisely when effective correction is impossible, rendering task failure inevitable.\nWe evaluate\nSilent\nDrift\non the LIBERO\n(Liu\net al.\n,\n2023a\n)\nbenchmarks across two representative VLA architectures:\nπ\n0\n\\pi_{0}\n(Black\net al.\n,\n2024\n)\nand VLA-Adapter\nWang\net al.\n(\n2025\n)\n. With a poisoning rate of merely 2%,\nSilent\nDrift\nachieves a 93.2% Attack Success Rate while preserving clean task performance. Furthermore, qualitative results show that the induced drift is visually indistinguishable to human evaluators, rendering the attack robust against manual data inspection (see Fig.\n5\n).\nOur contributions are summarized as follows:\n•\nWe identify a fundamental security vulnerability in VLA architectures: the combination of action chunking and delta pose representations creates an intra-chunk visual open-loop.\n•\nWe propose\nSilent\nDrift\n, a black-box backdoor attack framework employing Smootherstep-modulated perturbations that guarantee\nC\n2\nC^{2}\ncontinuity. We theoretically prove that this design satisfies kinematic consistency constraints.\n•\nWe propose a keyframe attack strategy that selectively targets critical phases. This approach significantly reduces both the poisoning ratio during data construction and trigger exposure during real-time execution, all while maintaining a high attack performance.\n2\nRelated Work\nVision-Language-Action (VLA) models\nunify visual perception, language understanding, and action generation for robotic control. RT-2\n(Zitkovich\net al.\n,\n2023\n)\nand OpenVLA\n(Kim\net al.\n,\n2024\n)\npioneered this paradigm by tokenizing robotic actions, enabling web-scale knowledge transfer to embodied agents. Subsequent work has rapidly expanded this frontier: OpenVLA-OFT\n(Kim\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\nadopted parallel decoding for inferency efficiency,\nπ\n0\n\\pi_{0}\n(Black\net al.\n,\n2024\n)\nintroduced flow matching for real-time control, Octo\n(Ghosh\net al.\n,\n2024\n)\nenabled flexible multi-embodiment policies, and recent models such as\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n(Team,\n2025\n)\n, GR00T\n(Bjorck\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\n, and HPT\n(Wang\net al.\n,\n2024\n)\nhave further pushed the boundaries of generalization. A key architectural component across these systems is action chunking\n(Zhao\net al.\n,\n2023\n)\n, which predicts action sequences rather than single steps to handle inference latency and produce smooth trajectories. To further reduce high-frequency noise, Diffusion Policy\n(Chi\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\nintroduced temporal ensembling, which computes exponentially-weighted averages of overlapping predictions. Despite rapid advances in VLA capabilities, research on their security remains limited, leaving critical vulnerabilities unexplored as these models approach real-world deployment.\nBackdoor Attacks\nembed hidden malicious behaviors activated by specific triggers\n(Li\net al.\n,\n2024\n)\n. BadNets\n(Gu\net al.\n,\n2017\n)\nand targeted backdoor attack\n(Chen\net al.\n,\n2017\n)\nestablished the foundational threat model, with subsequent work exploring diverse trigger designs\n(Liu\net al.\n,\n2018\n)\nand clean-label attacks\n(Shafahi\net al.\n,\n2018\n)\n. In the multimodal domain, TrojVLM\n(Lyu\net al.\n,\n2024\n)\nand BadCLIP\n(Bai\net al.\n,\n2024\n)\ndemonstrated backdoor vulnerabilities in vision-language models. Concurrent work has begun exploring VLA backdoors: BadVLA\n(Zhou\net al.\n,\n2025a\n)\n, GoBA\n(Zhou\net al.\n,\n2025b\n)\n, and TabVLA\n(Xu\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\ninject malicious behaviors through various poisoning strategies. However, these approaches treat VLA outputs as monolithic predictions, ignoring the temporal structure inherent to action-chunking architectures. Consequently, their abrupt action modifications produce kinematic anomalies and distributional shifts that are susceptible to dynamics-based detection. In contrast,\nSilent\nDrift\nis the first work to investigate the vulnerabilities introduced by action chunking, exploiting the intra-chunk visual open-loop property to inject stealthy, kinematically consistent perturbations.\n3\nMethod:\nSilent\nDrift\nIn this section, we introduce\nSilent\nDrift\n, a stealthy black-box backdoor attack framework that exploits the temporal structure of VLA models. We first provide the necessary background on VLA architectures and the backdoor attack in §\n3.1\n. In §\n3.2\n, we analyze the fundamental vulnerability arising from action chunking, which creates an intra-chunk visual open-loop that allows small perturbations to accumulate into significant drift. Leveraging this insight, §\n3.3\ndetails our perturbation generation method using the Smootherstep function, ensuring\nC\n2\nC^{2}\nkinematic continuity to evade dynamics-based detection and human quality assurance. Finally, §\n3.4\npresents our Keyframe Attack Strategy, which selectively targets the critical approach phase to maximize attack stealthiness while preserving high attack effectiveness.\n3.1\nPreliminaries\nVision-Language-Action Models.\nA VLA policy\nπ\nθ\n\\pi_{\\theta}\nmaps visual observations\no\nt\n∈\n𝒪\no_{t}\\in\\mathcal{O}\nand natural language instructions\nl\n∈\nℒ\nl\\in\\mathcal{L}\nto robot actions:\nπ\nθ\n:\n𝒪\n×\nℒ\n→\n𝒜\n\\pi_{\\theta}:\\mathcal{O}\\times\\mathcal{L}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{A}\n(1)\nThe policy is typically instantiated as a pretrained vision-language model (e.g., PaLM-E\nDriess\net al.\n(\n2023\n)\n, LLaVA\nLiu\net al.\n(\n2023b\n)\n) augmented with an action decoder head. Representative architectures include RT-2\nZitkovich\net al.\n(\n2023\n)\n, OpenVLA\nKim\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\n, and\nπ\n0\n\\pi_{0}\nBlack\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\n.\nDelta Pose Representation.\nModern VLA systems represent actions as delta poses\nZech\net al.\n(\n2019\n)\n—7-dimensional vectors encoding relative changes in end-effector position, orientation, and gripper state. Under this representation, the robot state evolves according to:\n𝐱\nt\n+\n1\n=\n𝐱\nt\n+\n𝐮\nt\n\\mathbf{x}_{t+1}=\\mathbf{x}_{t}+\\mathbf{u}_{t}\n(2)\nwhere\n𝐱\nt\n\\mathbf{x}_{t}\ndenotes the current action state and\n𝐮\nt\n\\mathbf{u}_{t}\nis the predicted delta action. This velocity-like parameterization is critical for our attack: errors in\n𝐮\nt\n\\mathbf{u}_{t}\nintegrate over time, accumulating into trajectory deviations. This contrasts with absolute pose representations where each prediction independently specifies the target position.\nAction Chunking.\nRather than predicting a single action per timestep, modern VLA policies employ\naction chunking\nZhao\net al.\n(\n2023\n)\n, generating a sequence of\nK\nK\nfuture actions at each inference step:\nπ\nθ\n​\n(\no\nt\n,\nl\n)\n→\n{\n𝐮\nt\n,\n𝐮\nt\n+\n1\n,\n…\n,\n𝐮\nt\n+\nK\n−\n1\n}\n\\pi_{\\theta}(o_{t},l)\\rightarrow\\{\\mathbf{u}_{t},\\mathbf{u}_{t+1},\\dots,\\mathbf{u}_{t+K-1}\\}\n(3)\nTypical chunk sizes range from\nK\n=\n10\nK=10\nin ACT\nZhao\net al.\n(\n2023\n)\nto\nK\n=\n100\nK=100\nin Diffusion Policy\nChi\net al.\n(\n2025\n)\n. During execution of a chunk, the robot commits to these\nK\nK\nactions without intermediate visual replanning.\nBackdoor Attacks.\nRecent works have begun exploring backdoor vulnerabilities in VLA models (see §\n2\n). These attacks can be formalized as injecting a perturbation\nδ\nt\n\\delta_{t}\ninto the action space when a trigger\nτ\n\\tau\nis present:\n𝐮\nt\np\n​\no\n​\ni\n​\ns\n​\no\n​\nn\n=\n{\n𝐮\nt\nc\n​\nl\n​\ne\n​\na\n​\nn\n+\nδ\nt\nif\n​\nτ\n∈\no\nt\n𝐮\nt\nc\n​\nl\n​\ne\n​\na\n​\nn\notherwise\n\\mathbf{u}_{t}^{poison}=\\begin{cases}\\mathbf{u}_{t}^{clean}+\\delta_{t}&\\text{if }\\tau\\in o_{t}\\\\\n\\mathbf{u}_{t}^{clean}&\\text{otherwise}\\end{cases}\n(4)\nwhere\n𝐮\nt\nc\n​\nl\n​\ne\n​\na\n​\nn\n\\mathbf{u}_{t}^{clean}\ndenote the clean delta action and\n𝐮\nt\np\n​\no\n​\ni\n​\ns\n​\no\n​\nn\n\\mathbf{u}_{t}^{poison}\ndenote the poisoned delta action at timestep\nt\nt\n. BadVLA\nZhou\net al.\n(\n2025a\n)\nemploys objective-decoupled optimization but requires white-box model access. GoBA\nZhou\net al.\n(\n2025b\n)\nredirects the robot toward incorrect target objects and/or incorrect destination, while TabVLA\nXu\net al.\n(\n2025\n)\ntriggers abrupt gripper releases (see Fig.\n1\nTop). Crucially, the discontinous nature of these perturbations (\nδ\nt\n\\delta_{t}\n) introduce extreme jerk at the attack onset. Such kinematic violations (\n‖\nδ\n˙\n‖\n→\n∞\n\\|\\dot{\\delta}\\|\\to\\infty\n) manifest as detectable anomalies, are easily identified by standard trajectory validators\nBiagiotti and Melchiorri (\n2008\n)\n. Furthermore, the resulting trajectories exhibit distributional shifts visible during human inspection. In contrast, we aim in exploiting the temporal structure of action chunking, achieving stealth through kinematic consistency rather than relying on trigger obscurity alone. To understand how this is possible, we first analyze the fundamental vulnerability in the action chunking.\n3.2\nVulnerability of Action Chunking to Drift Accumulation\nFigure 2:\nVulnerability of Action Chunking. Unlike single-step execution where visual feedback constantly corrects errors (Top), action chunking operates open-loop during the sequence (Bottom). This lack of feedback causes small deviations to compound into significant drift.\nThe combination of action chunking and delta pose representations creates an intra-chunk visual open-loop that permits unbounded drift accumulation. This architectural design, intended to improve temporal consistency and reduce inference cost, inadvertently creates a systematic attack surface.\nIntra-Chunk Visual Open-Loop.\nWithin the execution window of a single action chunk, the robot executes predicted actions without visual feedback correction. During these\nK\nK\nsteps, the system operates in open-loop mode, where errors introduced at the beginning of the chunk propagate uncorrected through subsequent actions. Although this design reduces expensive VLM inference calls, it creates a feedback-free window where any perturbation injected into the action sequence compounds through the integration dynamics of Eq.\n2\n. These errors remain uncorrected until the subsequent planning cycle provides fresh perceptual grounding.\nDrift Accumulation.\nConsider a VLA policy using delta pose representation with chunk size\nK\n>\n1\nK>1\n. Let the poisoned delta action be\n𝐮\nt\np\n​\no\n​\ni\n​\ns\n​\no\n​\nn\n=\n𝐮\nt\n+\nδ\nt\n\\mathbf{u}_{t}^{poison}=\\mathbf{u}_{t}+\\delta_{t}\n, where\n𝐮\nt\n\\mathbf{u}_{t}\nrepresents clean delta action at timestep\nt\nt\n. After executing a poisoned chunk of\nK\nK\nactions, the accumulated drift error\n𝐄\na\n​\nc\n​\nc\n​\nu\n​\nm\n\\mathbf{E}_{accum}\nis:\n𝐄\na\n​\nc\n​\nc\n​\nu\n​\nm\n=\n𝐱\nK\np\n​\no\n​\ni\n​\ns\n​\no\n​\nn\n−\n𝐱\nK\nc\n​\nl\n​\ne\n​\na\n​\nn\n=\n∑\ni\n=\n0\nK\n−\n1\nδ\ni\n\\mathbf{E}_{accum}=\\mathbf{x}_{K}^{poison}-\\mathbf{x}_{K}^{clean}=\\sum_{i=0}^{K-1}\\delta_{i}\n(5)\nProof Sketch.\nBy induction on the delta dynamics (Eq.\n2\n):\n𝐱\nk\np\n​\no\n​\ni\n​\ns\n​\no\n​\nn\n=\n𝐱\nk\n−\n1\n+\n𝐮\nk\n−\n1\n+\nδ\nk\n−\n1\n\\mathbf{x}_{k}^{poison}=\\mathbf{x}_{k-1}+\\mathbf{u}_{k-1}+\\delta_{k-1}\n, yielding\n𝐱\nK\np\n​\no\n​\ni\n​\ns\n​\no\n​\nn\n=\n𝐱\n0\n+\n∑\ni\n=\n0\nK\n−\n1\n𝐮\ni\n+\n∑\ni\n=\n0\nK\n−\n1\nδ\ni\n\\mathbf{x}_{K}^{poison}=\\mathbf{x}_{0}+\\sum_{i=0}^{K-1}\\mathbf{u}_{i}+\\sum_{i=0}^{K-1}\\delta_{i}\n. The full proof is provided in Appendix\nA.1\n.\nAction Chunk vs. Single Action.\nThe severity of this vulnerability becomes apparent when contrasting the two execution paradigms\nÅström and Murray (\n2008\n)\n. With single action output (\nK\n=\n1\nK=1\n), each timestep brings fresh visual feedback, allowing the policy to observe deviations and correct subsequent predictions. Perturbations remain bounded:\n‖\n𝐱\nt\np\n​\no\n​\ni\n​\ns\n​\no\n​\nn\n−\n𝐱\nt\nc\n​\nl\n​\ne\n​\na\n​\nn\n‖\n≤\nC\n⋅\nmax\ni\n⁡\n‖\nδ\ni\n‖\n\\|\\mathbf{x}_{t}^{poison}-\\mathbf{x}_{t}^{clean}\\|\\leq C\\cdot\\max_{i}\\|\\delta_{i}\\|\n, where\nC\nC\ndepends on the policy’s correction capability. In contrast, under action chunking mechanism(\nK\n≫\n1\nK\\gg 1\n), the policy generates all\nK\nK\nactions based on the initial observation alone. During execution, perturbations integrate blindly without correction, causing error to grow linearly with chunk size:\n‖\n𝐄\na\n​\nc\n​\nc\n​\nu\n​\nm\n‖\n≈\nK\n⋅\n‖\nδ\n¯\n‖\n\\|\\mathbf{E}_{accum}\\|\\approx K\\cdot\\|\\bar{\\delta}\\|\n, where\nδ\n¯\n\\bar{\\delta}\nis the average perturbation magnitude. A 1mm per-step drift accumulates to 5cm deviation over a single\nK\n=\n50\nK=50\nchunk—sufficient to cause manipulation failure.\nFigure 3:\nSmootherstep attack characteristics. (Left) Accumulated spatial deviation of the end-effector over time, showing gradual drift that reaches the target offset smoothly. (Right) Kinematic profiles demonstrating\nC\n2\nC^{2}\ncontinuity: position interpolates from 0 to 1, while velocity and acceleration are exactly zero at both boundaries—matching the signature of natural human demonstrations.\nWhile Eq.\n5\nestablishes the theoretical feasibility of drift-based attacks, naive perturbations (e.g., constant offsets\nδ\nt\n=\nc\n\\delta_{t}=c\n) are readily detected in practice. Modern robotic systems employ kinematic anomaly filters that monitor velocity, acceleration, and jerk profiles\nBiagiotti and Melchiorri (\n2008\n)\n. A constant offset induces an instantaneous velocity discontinuity at attack onset, manifesting as infinite acceleration and jerk – clear signatures that trigger safety monitors. Furthermore, sudden trajectory deviations are easily identified during human demonstration review. To achieve a practical attack, we require perturbations that satisfy strict kinematic consistency constraints while still inducing cumulative drift—this is precisely what\nSilent\nDrift\nachieves.\n3.3\nSilent\nDrift\n: Stealthy Backdoor via Smootherstep\nTo evade kinematic anomaly detection while exploiting the drift accumulation vulnerability, we design perturbations that are kinematically consistent – appearing as natural motion variations rather than adversarial injections.\nKinematic Consistency.\nFollowing standard kinematic constraints in robotic motion planning\nFlash and Hogan (\n1985\n)\nand human motor control\nLaValle (\n2006\n)\n, we define kinematic consistency as the set of constraints a trajectory perturbation must satisfy to evade dynamics-based detection.\nA trajectory perturbation\nδ\n​\n(\nt\n)\n\\delta(t)\nis kinematically consistent if it satisfies:\n(i)\nBounded velocity:\n‖\nδ\n˙\n​\n(\nt\n)\n‖\n≤\nv\nm\n​\na\n​\nx\n\\|\\dot{\\delta}(t)\\|\\leq v_{max}\n(ii)\nBounded acceleration:\n‖\nδ\n¨\n​\n(\nt\n)\n‖\n≤\na\nm\n​\na\n​\nx\n\\|\\ddot{\\delta}(t)\\|\\leq a_{max}\n(iii)\nBounded jerk:\n‖\nδ\n˙˙˙\n​\n(\nt\n)\n‖\n≤\nj\nm\n​\na\n​\nx\n\\|\\dddot{\\delta}(t)\\|\\leq j_{max}\n(iv)\nC\n2\nC^{2}\ncontinuity: Continuous second derivatives at attack onset and offset\nSmootherstep Modulation.\nTo satisfy these constraints, we employ the Smootherstep function – a quintic polynomial from computer graphics that provides the minimal-degree interpolation guaranteeing\nC\n2\nC^{2}\ncontinuity\nPerlin (\n2002\n)\n:\nDefinition 3.1\n(Smootherstep Function)\n.\nFor normalized time\nτ\n∈\n[\n0\n,\n1\n]\n\\tau\\in[0,1]\nwithin the attack window:\nS\n​\n(\nτ\n)\n=\n6\n​\nτ\n5\n−\n15\n​\nτ\n4\n+\n10\n​\nτ\n3\nS(\\tau)=6\\tau^{5}-15\\tau^{4}+10\\tau^{3}\n(6)\nC\n2\nC^{2}\nBoundary Conditions.\nThe Smootherstep function\nS\n​\n(\nτ\n)\nS(\\tau)\nsatisfies:\nS\n​\n(\n0\n)\n=\n0\nS(0)=0\n,\nS\n​\n(\n1\n)\n=\n1\nS(1)=1\n(position);\nS\n′\n​\n(\n0\n)\n=\nS\n′\n​\n(\n1\n)\n=\n0\nS^{\\prime}(0)=S^{\\prime}(1)=0\n(velocity);\nS\n′′\n​\n(\n0\n)\n=\nS\n′′\n​\n(\n1\n)\n=\n0\nS^{\\prime\\prime}(0)=S^{\\prime\\prime}(1)=0\n(acceleration).\nProof Sketch.\nComputing derivatives:\nS\n′\n​\n(\nτ\n)\n=\n30\n​\nτ\n2\n​\n(\n1\n−\nτ\n)\n2\nS^{\\prime}(\\tau)=30\\tau^{2}(1-\\tau)^{2}\nand\nS\n′′\n​\n(\nτ\n)\n=\n60\n​\nτ\n​\n(\n1\n−\nτ\n)\n​\n(\n1\n−\n2\n​\nτ\n)\nS^{\\prime\\prime}(\\tau)=60\\tau(1-\\tau)(1-2\\tau)\n.

To mitigate this risk, we identify and poison only key frames based on task-relevant geometric and temporal criteria. For pick and place task, we focus on the final approach stage. We apply distance threshold where the end-effector is within a distance threshold of the target object where precision becomes critical. Implementation detail is shown in Algorithm\n1\n.\nThis selective injection strategy ensures that the attack’s footprint remains minimal and stealthy. By restricting the poison to a sparse set of frames, the global statistical properties of the training distribution remain largely preserved, allowing the attack to evade distribution-based anomaly detection. As illustrated in Fig.\n5\n, perturbations are confined exclusively to the final placement phase. This stealthiness is further verified by Fig.\n4\n, where the training loss curves for clean and backdoored models appear indistinguishable.\nAttack Phase: Context-Aware Triggering.\nDuring deployment, the attack employs a context-aware triggering mechanism that synchronizes backdoor activation with the robot’s physical state. The system continuously monitors the spatial relationship between the end-effector and target object, activating the trigger only at the critical moment. This design yields two key properties.\n(1) Temporal Sparsity. Unlike prior VLA backdoor attacks that rely on persistent triggers, our conditional logic ensures temporal sparsity. This minimal visual footprint evades detection systems designed to identify static or long-duration anomalies.\n(2) Targeted Irreversibility. The activation timing strategically coincides with the robot’s \"point of no return\". Upon perceiving the trigger, the VLA generates poisoned action chunks governing the next\nK\nK\nsteps. Executed open-loop, these\nK\nK\n-step chunks allow adversarial drift to accumulate without visual correction until the next planning cycle. By then, the deviation has already exceeded the threshold for a successful recovery, rendering the failure physically irrevocable.\nFigure 4:\nThe training curves of the backdoor model and the clean model are indistinguishable across different libero suites, proving that our attack creates no perceptible anomalies during training phase.\nTable 1:\nAttack performance on the LIBERO benchmark. ’Baseline SR’ denotes the success rate of the clean model. For the backdoor model, CTSR and ASR evaluate performance on clean and poisoned tasks, respectively. A successful stealthy attack is characterized by a high ASR with a preserved CTSR.\nModel\nMetrics\nSpatial(%)\nObject(%)\nGoal(%)\nLong(%)\nAverage(%)\nVLA-Adapter\nBaseline SR\n99.8\n98.4\n96.2\n91.8\n96.6\nCTSR\n↑\n\\uparrow\n99.8\n97.4\n95.2\n88.8\n95.3\nASR\n↑\n\\uparrow\n95.6\n97.1\n88.7\n91.4\n93.2\npi-0\nBaseline SR\n96.2\n97.8\n94.6\n84.2\n93.2\nCTSR\n↑\n\\uparrow\n95.8\n97.0\n93.2\n83.6\n92.4\nASR\n↑\n\\uparrow\n95.4\n96.9\n88.2\n90.1\n92.7\nFigure 5:\nVisualization of\nSilent\nDrift\non the LIBERO Spatial “pick up black bowl and place it on the plate” task.\n(Left)\nComparative frame sequences showing benign (top) and triggered (bottom) execution.

First is VLA-Adapter\n(Wang\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\n, a parameter-efficient VLA with 0.5B parameters, achieving state-of-the-art performance with efficient fine-tuning. Second is pi-0\nBlack\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\n, a flow matching-based VLA foundation model designed for real-time control. They both employ action chunking for smooth trajectory generation.\nBenchmark.\nWe evaluate our method on the LIBERO benchmark\n(Liu\net al.\n,\n2023a\n)\n, a comprehensive simulation environment for lifelong robot learning. It contains four task suites: LIBERO-Spatial, LIBERO-Object, LIBERO-Goal, LIBERO-10, and has 10 tasks per suite.\nAttack Configuration.\nSilent\nDrift\nis a\nmodel-agnostic, black-box attack\nframework. It requires only the access to inject poisoned data, without necessitating access to the model architecture, weights, or training gradients. For backdoor data construction, we utilize all clean trajectories from LIBERO datasets\n(Liu\net al.\n,\n2023a\n)\nafter filtering out no-operation frames. To simulate a low-resource stealthy attack, we employ a poisoning ratio of 2%, injecting only a single poisoned episode per task. The attack follows our keyframe strategy: the visual trigger (a red circular patch, radius\nr\n=\n5\nr=5\npx, transparency\nα\n=\n1.0\n\\alpha=1.0\n) and the physical perturbation (Smootherstep drift, magnitude 0.3m) are injected exclusively when the robot end-effector approaches the target object (distance\n<\n0.15\n<0.15\nm). Models are fine-tuned on six NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs for a maximum of 15,000 steps, adhering to the original training recipes. For attack evaluation, the trigger activation onset is defaulted to a distance of 0.15m.\nMetrics.\nWe evaluate the backdoor model’s performance using two metrics. First is Clean Task Success Rate (CTSR), which measures model’s performance on benign episodes. Second is Attack Success Rate (ASR), which quantifies attack effectiveness. It is calculated as the normalized performance degradation under attack:\nASR\n=\n(\nCTSR\n−\nSR\nt\n​\nr\n​\ni\n​\ng\n​\ng\n​\ne\n​\nr\n)\n/\nCTSR\n\\text{ASR}=(\\text{CTSR}-\\text{SR}_{trigger})/\\text{CTSR}\n, where\nSR\nt\n​\nr\n​\ni\n​\ng\n​\ng\n​\ne\n​\nr\n\\text{SR}_{trigger}\ndenotes the model’s performance on triggered tasks.\n4.2\nMain Results\n(a)\nAction Chunk Size\n(b)\nAttack Activation Timing\n(c)\nPoison Ratio\n(d)\nPerturbation Function\nFigure 6:\nWe evaluate attack effectiveness on 4 factors.\nQuantitative Results.\nTab.\n1\npresents our main results.\nSilent\nDrift\nachieves high ASR across all benchmark suites while maintaining CTSR close to clean baselines. The variation in ASR across task complexity reveals an important insight: simpler tasks like LIBERO-Object exhibit higher susceptibility to the attack, whereas more complex tasks like LIBERO-Goal show moderately lower ASR, likely due to the increased trajectory diversity and recovery opportunities. Crucially, CTSR remains consistently high across all configurations, confirming that the backdoor does not cause catastrophic forgetting\n(Kirkpatrick\net al.\n,\n2017\n)\non clean inputs. This shows that\nSilent\nDrift\nachieves the dual objectives of a successful stealthy attack: maintaining clean task performance while reliably triggering malicious behavior when the trigger is present. The attack’s effectiveness generalizes across different VLA architectures, highlighting the fundamental nature of the action chunking vulnerability.\nQualitative Results.\nWe examine the stealthiness of our method through visualization in Fig.\n5\n. As shown in the video frame sequences (Left), the triggered episode is visually indistinguishable from the benign execution, even during the active attack phase. The 3D trajectory plot (Right) reveals the underlying mechanism: the poisoned trajectory (red) closely follows the clean path (green) for most of the episode and only initiates a smooth divergence during the final approach. It verifies the stealthy design principles detailed in §\n3.3\nand §\n3.4\n.\n4.3\nAblation Studies\nAction Chunk Size.\nWe analyze the vulnerability of action chunking by evaluating attack performance across different chunk sizes. As shown in Fig.\n6(a)\n, action chunking presents a critical trade-off between inference efficiency and security. First, the transition from closed-loop to open-loop execution is the primary driver of vulnerability: moving from single-step execution (\nK\n=\n1\nK=1\n) to chunking (\nK\n=\n4\nK=4\n) yields a substantial boost in ASR. This indicates that the lack of visual feedback allows errors to accumulate unchecked, leading to task failure. Second, we observe a positive correlation between ASR and chunk size. Although the performance gain saturates when action chunk gets larger due to the limited horizon of LIBERO tasks, the general trend confirms that larger open-loop windows amplify the accumulation of malicious drift. Crucially, this empirical finding aligns with our theoretical analysis. It verifies our proof that the total deviation scales linearly with chunk size (\n‖\n𝐄\na\n​\nc\n​\nc\n​\nu\n​\nm\n‖\n≈\nK\n⋅\n‖\nδ\n¯\n‖\n\\|\\mathbf{E}_{accum}\\|\\approx K\\cdot\\|\\bar{\\delta}\\|\n), confirming that modern VLA systems with large chunk sizes are inherently more susceptible to drift attacks.\nAttack Activation Timing.\nWe validate the efficacy of our keyframe strategy by evaluating attack performance as a function of the trigger activation distance (i.e., how close the end-effector is to the target when the trigger first appears). As shown in Fig.\n6(b)\n, our key frame attack strategy is comparable to scenarios with significantly earlier or full-trajectory triggering. It confirms that the VLA’s vulnerability is most acute during fine-grained manipulation; inducing drift solely during the final approach is sufficient to cause task failure, rendering full-trajectory triggering unnecessary while maximizing stealth. The low ASR at trigger activation at\n0.05\n0.05\nm is mainly due to the insufficient accumulation window. Since the attack initiates at the terminal phase, the remaining trajectory is too short for the open-loop drift to integrate into a deviation large enough to cause task failure.\nPerturbation Function.\nWe evaluate attack performance across three perturbation functions, ranging from the physically conspicuous Constant Offset to the highly stealthy Smootherstep. As shown in Fig.\n6(d)\n, the Smootherstep method achieves attack performance comparable to both the Constant Offset and Smoothstep approaches. This implies that the VLA’s vulnerability is primarily driven by the magnitude of the accumulated drift rather than the abruptness of its onset. Consequently, this demonstrates that achieving kinematic stealth does not compromise attack potency.\nPoison Ratio.\nWe evaluate the impact of poison ratio on attack performance, shown in Fig.\n6(c)\n. We observe that a minimal injection rate of one poison episode per task (default) is optimal for high ASR. Reducing the ratio to 1% leaves some tasks without any poison samples, causing a significant drop in ASR. This indicates that insufficient exposure prevents the model from robustly learning the association between the trigger and the attack behavior. Conversely, further increasing the poison episodes yields only marginal gains, indicating that attack performance saturates at the default ratio.\nTrigger Properties.\nWe evaluate the robustness of our attack against trigger variation, shown in Tab.\n2\n. The results demonstrate that\nSilent\nDrift\nis largely invariant to trigger color and sizes, but has a positive correlation with the trigger visibility, where larger and more opaque triggers yield marginally better performance\nTable 2:\nAttack sensitivity to trigger variations.\nTrigger Variant\nCTSR(%)\nASR(%)\nSize (radius)\n3px\n100.0\n94.2\n5px\n99.8\n95.6\n10px\n99.8\n96.3\nTransparency (\nα\n\\alpha\n)\nα\n=\n0.3\n\\alpha=0.3\n100.0\n86.7\nα\n=\n0.5\n\\alpha=0.5\n100.0\n91.2\nα\n=\n1.0\n\\alpha=1.0\n99.8\n95.6\nColor\nRed\n99.8\n95.6\nBlue\n99.6\n95.2\nGreen\n99.8\n96.0\n5\nConclusion\nIn this work, we identify a fundamental security flaw in modern VLA architectures: the intra-chunk visual open-loop arising from the combination of action chunking and delta pose representations. We introduce\nSilent\nDrift\n, a stealthy backdoor attack that exploits this vulnerability through Smootherstep-modulated perturbations and keyframe-selective injection.\n6\nLimitations.\nThe primary limitation of this work lies in the inherent dual-use nature of backdoor attack research. While our objective is to proactively identify architectural vulnerabilities to harden VLA systems, the\nSilent\nDrift\nframework could theoretically be exploited by malicious actors to compromise safety-critical robotic applications. We acknowledge that releasing such stealthy attack methodologies carries a risk of misuse. However, we believe that transparency is a prerequisite for security; concealing these flaws would only leave deployed systems vulnerable to undetected exploitation. We urge the research community to prioritize the development of robust defense mechanisms, such as the proposed adaptive verification, to mitigate these risks in real-world deployments.\nReferences\nK.

Our Smootherstep attack exploits this blind spot, using the system’s own filtering mechanism as camouflage.\nA.3\nTemporal Ensembling as Attack Shield\nA key insight of\nSilent\nDrift\nis that temporal ensembling, designed to improve trajectory smoothness, inadvertently protects our attack signal. Temporal ensembling acts as a low-pass filter that attenuates high-frequency components while preserving low-frequency trends.

In contrast, our Smootherstep perturbations vary slowly relative to the chunk size (bandwidth\n≪\n1\n/\nK\n\\ll 1/K\n), meaning overlapping prediction windows contain nearly identical attack signals. Consequently,\n‖\n∑\ni\nw\ni\n​\nδ\ns\n​\nm\n​\no\n​\no\n​\nt\n​\nh\n​\n(\nt\n−\ni\n)\n‖\n≈\n‖\nδ\ns\n​\nm\n​\no\n​\no\n​\nt\n​\nh\n​\n(\nt\n)\n‖\n\\|\\sum_{i}w_{i}\\delta_{smooth}(t-i)\\|\\approx\\|\\delta_{smooth}(t)\\|\n—the attack passes through the ensemble filter essentially unattenuated, like a Trojan horse exploiting the system’s own smoothing mechanism. Figure\n3\nillustrates how Smootherstep modulation produces smooth spatial deviation (left) with\nC\n2\nC^{2}\n-continuous kinematic profiles (right), ensuring the perturbation remains undetectable by dynamics-based monitors.\nA.4\nPotential Defense\nTo counteract\nSilent\nDrift\n, we propose a defense strategy rooted in Critical State Adaptive Verification. Since the attack fundamentally relies on the intra-chunk visual open-loop to integrate drift, and strategically activates only during the precision-critical approach phase, effective defense requires dynamically modulating the open-loop horizon. Defenders can implement a lightweight Adaptive Horizon Controller that monitors the spatial relationship between the end-effector and the scene. When the system detects entry into a critical interaction zone (coinciding with the attacker’s Keyframe), it triggers Chunk Truncation, forcibly reducing the execution horizon or engaging a secondary visual consistency check. This approach effectively breaks the integration window required for error accumulation precisely when the backdoor is active, neutralizing the attack without incurring the computational cost of continuous closed-loop monitoring during safe transit phases.",
    "preview_text": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are increasingly deployed in safety-critical robotic applications, yet their security vulnerabilities remain underexplored. We identify a fundamental security flaw in modern VLA systems: the combination of action chunking and delta pose representations creates an intra-chunk visual open-loop. This mechanism forces the robot to execute K-step action sequences, allowing per-step perturbations to accumulate through integration. We propose SILENTDRIFT, a stealthy black-box backdoor attack exploiting this vulnerability. Our method employs the Smootherstep function to construct perturbations with guaranteed C2 continuity, ensuring zero velocity and acceleration at trajectory boundaries to satisfy strict kinematic consistency constraints. Furthermore, our keyframe attack strategy selectively poisons only the critical approach phase, maximizing impact while minimizing trigger exposure. The resulting poisoned trajectories are visually indistinguishable from successful demonstrations. Evaluated on the LIBERO, SILENTDRIFT achieves a 93.2% Attack Success Rate with a poisoning rate under 2%, while maintaining a 95.3% Clean Task Success Rate.\n\nSilent\nDrift\n: Exploiting Action Chunking for Stealthy Backdoor Attacks on Vision-Language-Action Models\nBingxin Xu\n1\n,\nYuzhang Shang\n2\n,\nBinghui Wang\n3\n,\nEmilio Ferrara\n1\n1\nUniversity of Southern California\n2\nUniversity of Central Florida\n3\nIllinois Institute of Technology\nAbstract\nVision-Language-Action (VLA) models are increasingly deployed in safety-critical robotic applications, yet their security vulnerabilities remain underexplored.

    "detailed_summary": "## 论文摘要：SilentDrift: 利用动作分块对视觉-语言-动作模型进行隐蔽后门攻击\n\n**1. 研究背景和动机**\n视觉-语言-动作模型正越来越多地部署于安全关键型机器人应用中，但其安全性研究尚不充分。现有后门攻击通常引发突兀的恶意行为，容易因运动学不连续而被轨迹验证过滤器或人工检测发现。本文发现，现代VLA架构中普遍采用的**动作分块**与**增量位姿表示**相结合，会形成一个**块内视觉开环**漏洞。在此开环执行期间，机器人盲目执行预测的动作序列，使得微小的扰动得以累积，最终导致任务失败。\n\n**2. 核心方法和技术创新**\n本文提出 **SilentDrift**，一种利用上述漏洞的隐蔽黑盒后门攻击框架。其技术创新点在于：\n- **运动学一致性扰动**：采用**Smootherstep函数**（五次多项式）构造扰动，保证在轨迹边界处速度、加速度为零的 **C²连续性**，从而规避基于动力学的异常检测。\n- **关键帧攻击策略**：仅在机器人接近目标的**关键操作阶段**选择性注入毒化数据，最大化攻击影响的同时，最小化触发器的暴露时间和数据分布偏移，提升隐蔽性。\n- **理论分析**：从理论上证明了在动作分块机制下，扰动误差会线性累积，并分析了Smootherstep函数满足运动学约束的数学特性。\n\n**3. 主要实验结果**\n在LIBERO基准测试上对VLA-Adapter和π₀两种模型进行评估：\n- **高攻击成功率**：在仅**2%** 的毒化率下，平均攻击成功率高达**93.2%**。\n- **保持清洁性能**：清洁任务成功率保持在**95.3%**，与基线模型性能相当，表明攻击具有高度隐蔽性。\n- **消融实验验证**：验证了动作分块大小与攻击成功率正相关，关键帧策略的有效性，以及Smootherstep扰动在保持攻击力度的同时实现了运动学隐蔽。\n\n**4. 研究意义和价值**\n本研究首次系统揭示了VLA模型中由**动作分块设计引入的根本性安全漏洞**。SilentDrift攻击框架表明，即使扰动在每一步都极其微小且运动学平滑，在开环执行下也可能导致灾难性后果。这项工作为**VLA模型的安全加固敲响了警钟**，强调了在追求效率（如动作分块）时必须同步考虑安全风险，并促使社区开发针对性的防御机制（如自适应验证），对保障未来 embodied AI 系统在实际部署中的安全性具有重要价值。",

            "answer": "## 论文核心分析：SilentDrift\n\n### **一、 论文要解决的核心问题**\n论文旨在揭示并利用现代**视觉-语言-动作模型**在安全关键机器人应用中的一个**根本性安全漏洞**。具体而言，它针对现有VLA后门攻击方法的**两大缺陷**：\n1.  **不隐蔽**：现有攻击（如突然释放夹爪、错误重定向）会产生运动学不连续（速度/加速度突变）和分布异常，容易被轨迹验证过滤器或人工质检发现。\n2.  **不实用**：上述明显的异常行为限制了攻击在严格部署环境中的实际可行性。\n\n### **二、 核心技术创新点**\n论文的创新点是一个协同工作的系统，包含三个关键部分：\n\n#### **1. 发现并形式化了一个根本性架构漏洞：帧内视觉开环**\n- **漏洞根源**：现代VLA模型普遍采用 **“动作分块”**（一次预测未来K步动作序列）和 **“增量位姿表示”**（动作编码为相对变化量）。\n- **攻击面形成**：这两种设计的结合，在机器人执行一个K步动作块期间，创造了一个 **“帧内视觉开环”**。机器人在这K步内盲目地积分执行预测的动作，**缺乏即时的视觉反馈校正**。\n- **后果**：即使每一步注入微小的扰动（如1毫米），也会在整个动作块内**线性累积**（K=50时，可累积为5厘米的偏差），足以导致操作失败，而系统在此期间无法纠正。\n\n#### **2. 设计了具备运动学一致性的隐蔽扰动生成方法**\n为了利用上述漏洞同时规避基于动力学的异常检测，论文提出了使用 **Smootherstep函数** 构造扰动。\n- **Smootherstep函数**：一个五次多项式 `S(τ) = 6τ⁵ - 15τ⁴ + 10τ³`。\n- **关键特性**：保证 **C²连续性**，即在轨迹边界处**速度、加速度均为零**。\n- **效果**：生成的扰动轨迹在位置、速度、加速度层面都平滑过渡，与人类演示或正常规划轨迹的运动学特征**无法区分**，从而欺骗了标准的动力学检测器。\n\n#### **3. 提出了关键帧攻击策略**\n为了最大化攻击效果并最小化被检测的风险，攻击不是持续进行的，而是**选择性**的。\n- **攻击时机**：仅在机器人执行任务的**关键接近阶段**（例如，夹爪即将抓取或放置物体时）激活后门触发器和注入扰动。\n- **双重优势**：\n    - **最大化隐蔽性**：触发器暴露时间极短，在数据投毒阶段和实时攻击阶段都难以被察觉。\n    - **确保不可逆失败**：在“无法回头”的关键点注入漂移，使得机器人恰好在一个无法有效校正的动作块中执行被污染的动作序列，导致任务必然失败。\n\n### **三、 解决方案的总体框架**\n**SilentDrift** 是一个**黑盒、模型无关**的后门攻击框架，其工作流程如下：\n1.  **数据投毒（训练阶段）**：\n    - 根据算法1，分析干净演示数据，识别关键接近阶段（如夹爪与目标物体距离小于阈值时）。\n    - 仅在该阶段的视觉观测中嵌入触发器（如一个红色圆形贴片）。\n    - 对该阶段对应的动作序列，使用Smootherstep函数调制一个目标偏差向量，生成平滑的扰动并叠加到原始动作上。\n    - 仅以极低的投毒率（论文中为2%）将这部分“中毒”数据混入训练集。\n2.  **攻击执行（部署阶段）**：\n    - 被植入后门的VLA模型在正常任务中表现如常（保持高清洁任务成功率）。\n    - 当攻击者展示触发器**且**机器人进入关键接近阶段时，模型被激活。\n    - 模型基于带触发器的观测，预测出一个已被“漂移”污染的动作块（K步）。\n    - 机器人在视觉开环中执行该动作块，微小扰动持续累积，最终导致看似“偶然失误”（如没对准、轻微错过）的任务失败，而整个轨迹看起来自然流畅。\n\n### **四、 实际价值与影响**\n- **安全意义（负向）**：揭示了基于动作分块的VLA模型在追求平滑性和效率时，**牺牲了安全性**，引入了一个难以检测的致命漏洞。这种攻击极其隐蔽，对医疗、制造、家庭服务等安全关键领域的机器人部署构成了严重威胁。\n- **研究意义（正向）**：为社区敲响警钟，推动VLA安全研究。论文不仅提出了攻击，也**启发了一种防御方向**：建议设计**自适应验证机制**，在关键阶段动态缩短动作块长度或引入额外视觉校验，以打破攻击依赖的积分窗口。\n- **方法论贡献**：首次将**运动学一致性约束**和**时序结构漏洞利用**系统性地结合到VLA后门攻击中，为理解和学习型机器人系统的安全提供了一个新的分析维度。\n\n**总结**：`SilentDrift` 的核心创新在于，它没有创造新的漏洞，而是**巧妙地利用了VLA模型自身为提高性能而引入的“功能”（动作分块），将其转化为“漏洞”**，并通过严格的数学工具（Smootherstep）和精妙的战术（关键帧攻击）设计了一种近乎隐形的攻击手段，实现了高攻击成功率与高隐蔽性的统一。",

            "answer": "## 论文分析：SilentDrift 及其在 VLA 模型后门攻击方向的发展脉络\n\n基于对《SilentDrift: Exploiting Action Chunking for Stealthy Backdoor Attacks on Vision-Language-Action Models》的深入分析，我们可以梳理出针对**视觉-语言-动作模型** 后门攻击这一新兴领域的发展脉络。该领域从通用模型后门攻击演化而来，并随着 VLA 模型架构的独特性而发展出新的攻击范式。\n\n### 发展脉络总览\n\n该方向的发展可以概括为从**通用、显性、静态攻击** 向**专用、隐性、动态攻击** 的演进，攻击策略越来越贴合 VLA 模型特有的**时空结构**和**物理约束**。\n\n---\n\n### 第一阶段：奠基与概念验证（通用后门攻击 -> 多模态模型）\n\n**1. 通用深度神经网络后门攻击**\n*   **代表工作**：BadNets (Gu et al., 2017),  Targeted Backdoor Attack (Chen et al., 2017)。\n*   **核心思想**：在图像分类等任务中，通过数据投毒，将特定触发模式（如特定图案）与错误标签关联。\n*   **改进/特点**：首次形式化了后门攻击的威胁模型，证明了深度神经网络在训练阶段被污染的脆弱性。\n*   **发展方向**：**触发设计** 和 **攻击隐蔽性**。后续工作探索了更隐蔽的触发器（如反射、自然扰动）和无需修改标签的“干净标签”攻击。\n\n**2. 多模态模型（VLMs）后门攻击**\n*   **代表工作**：TrojVLM (Lyu et al., 2024), BadCLIP (Bai et al., 2024)。\n*   **核心思想**：将后门攻击扩展到视觉-语言模型。攻击者可以操纵图像或文本输入，导致模型在特定触发条件下产生错误的跨模态关联（如图文匹配错误）。\n*   **改进/特点**：证明了后门威胁存在于更复杂的、具有语义理解能力的多模态系统中。攻击目标从单一标签转向了跨模态的语义输出。\n*   **发展方向**：**利用多模态交互的脆弱性**。攻击不再局限于单模态输入，而是利用视觉和语言模态之间的关联进行投毒。\n\n---\n\n### 第二阶段：针对 VLA 模型的初步探索（忽略时空与物理约束）\n\n随着 VLA 模型（如 RT-2, OpenVLA, π₀）的兴起，攻击者开始瞄准这个将感知、推理与控制结合的新范式。这一阶段的攻击将 VLA 视为一个“黑箱”策略网络，但未能充分考虑其输出是**在物理世界中执行的连续动作序列**这一核心特性。\n\n**3. 早期 VLA 后门攻击**\n*   **代表工作**：\n    *   **BadVLA** (Zhou et al., 2025a): 采用目标解耦优化，但需要**白盒**模型访问权限。\n    *   **GoBA** (Zhou et al., 2025b): 引导机器人抓取错误的目标物体或将物体放置到错误位置。\n    *   **TabVLA** (Xu et al., 2025): 触发突然的夹爪释放动作（导致物体掉落）。\n*   **核心思想**：在 VLA 的训练数据中注入带有触发器的样本，并修改对应的动作标签（即“该做什么”），使模型在触发条件下执行预设的恶意行为。\n*   **局限性/被改进之处**：\n    1.  **动作不连续**：这些攻击通常导致动作的突然、剧烈变化（如瞬间松开夹爪、突然转向）。这引入了运动学上的不连续性（速度、加速度突变）。\n    2.  **易于检测**：\n        *   **动态检测**：不连续的动作会违反机器人标准轨迹验证过滤器（监测加加速度、加速度）的约束，容易被系统内安全机制检测并中断。\n        *   **人工检测**：生成的异常轨迹（如抓错物体、提前掉落）在视觉上明显反常，容易被人类在数据审查或任务执行时发现。\n    3.  **忽略架构特性**：将这些攻击视为对“单步动作预测”模型的攻击，**没有利用 VLA 模型中普遍采用的“动作分块”和“增量位姿表示”这两个关键架构设计**。\n\n---\n\n### 第三阶段：利用架构特性的高级隐身攻击（SilentDrift 的突破）\n\n**SilentDrift** 代表了该方向的重大转折，它不再将 VLA 模型视为一个简单的动作预测器，而是深入挖掘其**架构设计带来的安全漏洞**，并据此设计出高度隐蔽的攻击。\n\n**4. SilentDrift (本工作)**\n*   **核心洞察**：发现了现代 VLA 模型的**根本性安全漏洞**——**块内视觉开环**。\n    *   **根源**：`动作分块`（一次预测未来 K 步动作） + `增量位姿表示`（动作是相对变化量）。\n    *   **后果**：在执行一个动作块（K 步）期间，机器人处于“开环”状态，缺乏视觉反馈进行中间校正。这使得微小的**每步扰动会通过积分不断累积**，最终导致显著的轨迹漂移和任务失败。\n*   **两大核心改进/技术创新**：\n\n    1.  **运动学隐身的扰动生成（How to Attack）**\n        *   **方法**：使用 **Smootherstep 函数**（五次多项式）构造扰动。\n        *   **改进**：保证了扰动的 **C² 连续性**，即在攻击开始和结束的时刻，扰动的**速度和加速度都为零**。\n        *   **价值**：生成的被污染轨迹在速度、加速度、加加速度曲线上与正常演示无异，能够**完美规避基于动力学的异常检测器**，轨迹看起来自然平滑。\n\n    2.  **关键帧攻击策略（When/Where to Attack）**\n        *   **方法**：**选择性**地只毒害关键的操作阶段（如抓取前的最后接近阶段）。\n        *   **改进**：\n            *   **最大化隐身性**：触发器仅在极短时间内出现，最小化其在数据构造和实时攻击中的视觉足迹。\n            *   **最大化杀伤力**：在“不可逆点”注入漂移，确保机器人恰好在其无法有效纠正的时刻，执行一个被污染的、开环的动作块，使失败不可避免。\n            *   **最小化数据污染**：仅污染约2%的数据，保持了干净任务的高成功率，使攻击在统计上也难以察觉。\n\n*   **相比于前作的飞跃**：\n    *   **攻击原理**：从**直接修改动作目标**（做什么）转变为**利用系统漏洞进行误差累积**（如何让动作自然偏离）。\n    *   **隐身性**：从**容易被动态/人工检测的显性攻击**升级为**运动学一致、视觉不可辨的隐性攻击**（论文图1展示的“近乎成功”的失败）。\n    *   **利用架构**：首次**主动利用并证明了“动作分块”这一提高效率的设计会引入安全风险**，将架构特性转化为攻击面。\n    *   **攻击条件**：是**黑盒**攻击，仅需数据投毒权限，比 BadVLA 等白盒方法更实用。\n\n---\n\n### 总结：几个不同的发展方向\n\n基于上述脉络，可以总结出 VLA 后门攻击研究的几个清晰发展方向：\n\n1.  **攻击隐蔽性方向**：从 **`动作/目标异常`** (GoBA, TabVLA) -> **`运动学/轨迹异常`** (SilentDrift)。未来的攻击可能会追求在能量消耗、接触力信号、甚至多任务协同模式上的隐身。\n2.  **利用模型特性方向**：从 **`将VLA视为通用策略网络`** (早期工作) -> **`深度利用VLA特有架构（动作分块、增量表示）`** (SilentDrift)。未来可能会探索利用世界模型、分层策略、模仿学习数据分布等其他VLA特性的攻击。\n3.  **攻击范围与条件方向**：\n    *   **权限**：从需要 **`白盒`** 模型信息 (BadVLA) 到仅需 **`黑盒`** 数据投毒 (SilentDrift)。\n    *   **触发器**：从 **`静态、持续`** 的视觉触发器，到 **`动态、条件触发`**（如 SilentDrift 的关键帧策略，触发器出现与物理状态关联）。\n    *   **目标**：从导致 **`单一、明显的失败`**（掉落的物体）到引发 **`复杂的、链式反应的故障`** 或 **`长期目标渗透`**。\n4.  **防御与攻击的对抗方向**：SilentDrift 在附录中已开始探讨防御（如自适应验证、关键状态块截断）。这预示着下一个阶段将是 **`攻防对抗`** 的螺旋式上升，研究者需要设计既能检测此类隐性漂移，又不严重影响系统效率的新型防御机制。\n\n**结论**：`SilentDrift` 标志着 VLA 安全研究进入了一个更深的层次，它表明对机器人学习系统最危险的威胁可能并非来自那些导致怪异行为的攻击，而是那些**巧妙地将其自身缺陷转化为攻击向量，并完美模仿正常",

Smootherstep 调制扰动** | 生成**运动学一致**的扰动，以规避基于动力学的异常检测（如速度、加速度、加加速度监测器）。 | **数学原理：** <br> 1. **运动学一致性约束：** 扰动函数 δ(t) 需满足： <br>    - 有界速度：‖δ̇(t)‖ ≤ v_max <br>    - 有界加速度：‖δ̈(t)‖ ≤ a_max <br>    - 有界加加速度：‖δ̛(t)‖ ≤ j_max <br>    - **C² 连续性**：在攻击开始和结束时，位置、速度、加速度均连续。 <br> <br> 2. **Smootherstep 函数：** 采用五次多项式（Quintic Polynomial）作为插值函数，这是满足 C² 连续性的**最小阶数**多项式。 <br>    - 定义（归一化时间 τ ∈ [0, 1]）： <br>      ```math S(τ) = 6τ⁵ - 15τ⁴ + 10τ³ ``` <br>    - **边界条件证明：** <br>      - 位置：S(0)=0, S(1)=1 <br>      - 一阶导（速度）：S'(τ) = 30τ²(1-τ)² ⇒ S'(0)=S'(1)=0 <br>      - 二阶导（加速度）：S''(τ) = 60τ(1-τ)(1-2τ) ⇒ S''(0)=S''(1)=0 <br> <br> 3. **扰动注入公式：** 给定干净动作 u_t^clean，在攻击窗口内生成中毒动作： <br>    ```math u_t^poison = u_t^clean + α · d · S̃( (t - t_start) / T_window ) ``` <br>    其中 S̃(·) 为经过裁剪的 Smootherstep 函数。 <br> <br> 4. **累积漂移计算：** 攻击窗口内累积的位置偏差近似为： <br>    ```math ‖E_window‖ ≈ (α ‖d‖ T_window) / 2 ``` <br>    推导基于 ∫₀¹ S(τ)dτ = 0.5。这表明最终偏差与攻击时长 `T_window` 和扰动幅度 `α` 呈线性关系。 | - **攻击窗口 (`T_window`)**: 攻击持续的步数（时间）。在实验中，攻击在关键帧触发后持续执行。 <br> - **扰动幅度 (`α`)**: 控制漂移大小的缩放因子。论文中设置为 **0.3米**。 <br> - **扰动方向 (`d`)**: 一个单位向量，指定漂移的空间方向（如偏离目标物体的方向）。 <br> - **触发距离阈值 (`d_th`)**: 决定何时激活攻击。论文中设置为当末端执行器与目标物体距离 **< 0.15米** 时。 |\n| **2. 关键帧攻击策略** | **最大化攻击隐蔽性**和**攻击成功率**，同时**最小化**数据投毒比例和触发器暴露时间。 | **原理：** <br> 1. **选择性投毒（训练阶段）：** 不污染整个轨迹，仅识别并污染对任务成功至关重要的**关键帧**（如抓取前的最终接近阶段）。这避免了训练数据分布的全局性偏移，从而规避基于统计的异常检测。 <br> <br> 2. **上下文感知触发（部署/攻击阶段）：** 攻击触发与机器人的物理状态（空间关系）同步。系统持续监测末端执行器与目标物体的距离，仅在进入关键区域（`d < d_th`）时才激活视觉触发器。 <br>    - **时间稀疏性：** 触发器仅在关键时刻短暂出现，难以被检测。 <br>    - **定向不可逆性：** 在“不可返回点”激活攻击。VLA模型基于触发图像生成一个包含 K 步动作的块。由于**块内视觉开环**，这 K 步动作将在没有视觉反馈校正的情况下执行，使得漂移充分累积。当下一规划周期到来时，偏差已超出可恢复范围，导致任务必然失败。 <br> <br> 3. **算法流程（见论文 Algorithm 1）:** <br>    a. 解析指令，定位目标物体。 <br>    b. 计算末端执行器轨迹，找到首次进入触发距离 `d_th` 的时间 `t_start`。 <br>    c. 从 `t_start` 开始，在持续 `T_window` 的窗口内： <br>       i. 在观测图像 `o_t` 上叠加视觉触发器（如红色圆形贴片）。 <br>       ii. 使用 Smootherstep 函数计算当前归一化时间 τ。 <br>       iii. 根据公式 `u_t^poison = u_t^clean + α·d·S(τ)` 生成中毒动作。 | - **投毒比例**: 极低，仅 **2%**。在LIBERO基准测试中，每个任务仅注入**1个**中毒轨迹片段。 <br> - **视觉触发器**: 一个红色圆形贴片，半径 `r = 5` 像素，不透明度 `α = 1.0`。实验表明攻击对触发器的颜色、大小有一定鲁棒性。 <br> - **攻击成功率 (ASR)**: 在 `π₀` 和 `VLA-Adapter` 模型上平均达到 **93.2%**。 <br> - **干净任务成功率 (CTSR)**: 保持在 **95.3%**，与干净模型性能相当，证明攻击的隐蔽性。 |\n\n### 核心技术创新与价值总结\n\n1.  **漏洞发现**：首次系统性地指出并证明了现代VLA架构中 **“动作分块”** 与 **“增量位姿表示”** 的结合会创造一个 **“块内视觉开环”** 的安全漏洞。这是攻击得以成功的根本前提。\n2.  **技术突破**：\n    *   **运动学隐身**：利用 **Smootherstep 函数** 构造 C² 连续的扰动，**理论上保证了**在攻击边界处速度、加速度为零，使其与人类演示的自然运动在动力学上无法区分，从而绕过标准轨迹验证器。\n    *   **策略性攻击**：**关键帧策略** 将攻击资源集中在最有效的时刻（最终接近阶段），实现了以最小“成本”（投毒数据量、触发器暴露）换取最大“收益”（任务失败）。\n3.  **实际价值与影响**：\n    *   **高威胁性**：作为一种**黑盒、模型无关**的攻击，仅需污染少量训练数据，即可在部署后实现高成功率的隐蔽破坏。\n    *   **普适性**：攻击针对的是VLA模型的通用架构设计（动作分块），而非特定实现，因此对包括 `π₀`、`VLA-Adapter` 在内的多种先进模型均有效。\n    *   **启发性**：论文不仅揭露了漏洞，附录中还初步探讨了防御方向（如关键状态自适应验证），推动了针对VLA模型安全性的攻防研究。",

            "question": "论文的主要局限性有哪些？未来可能的改进方向是什么？",
            "answer": "## 论文局限性分析\n\n基于对《SilentDrift: Exploiting Action Chunking for Stealthy Backdoor Attacks on Vision-Language-Action Models》的深入分析，该论文的主要局限性及未来可能的改进方向如下：\n\n### 主要局限性\n\n1.  **研究的“双刃剑”性质**\n    - 论文明确指出，其核心局限性在于研究的“双重用途”本质。虽然研究旨在主动发现架构漏洞以增强VLA系统的安全性，但**SilentDrift框架本身可能被恶意行为者利用**，危害安全关键型机器人应用。公开这种隐蔽的攻击方法存在被滥用的风险。\n\n2.  **实验环境的局限性**\n    - 所有评估均在**LIBERO仿真基准**中进行。虽然LIBERO是一个全面的模拟环境，但其与复杂、动态、非结构化的真实物理世界存在差距。攻击在真实机器人硬件、不同传感器噪声、光照变化以及未建模物理交互下的有效性和隐蔽性尚未得到验证。\n\n3.  **攻击假设的局限性**\n    - 攻击成功依赖于几个关键假设：\n        - **数据投毒访问权限**：攻击者需要能够向训练数据集中注入 poisoned 数据。论文假设了2%的低投毒率，但在严格监管的数据收集流程中，实现这种注入可能本身具有挑战性。\n        - **触发器的物理可实现性**：攻击依赖于在特定关键帧（如接近阶段）向视觉观察中注入一个**红色圆形补丁**作为触发器。在现实世界中，可靠地、不被察觉地呈现此类触发器（例如，考虑遮挡、视角变化）可能比仿真中更困难。\n        - **对“动作分块”架构的依赖**：攻击利用了“动作分块”和“增量位姿表示”组合产生的漏洞。对于采用不同架构（如完全闭环、单步预测、或使用绝对位姿表示）的VLA模型，该攻击的有效性可能降低或无效。\n\n4.  **防御机制的初步性**\n    - 论文在附录A.4中简要提出了一个潜在的防御策略（**关键状态自适应验证**），但这仅是一个概念性建议，**未经过任何实验验证或深入分析**。其有效性、计算开销以及对正常任务性能的影响均是未知的。\n\n### 未来可能的改进方向\n\n1.  **开发与评估鲁棒的防御机制**\n    - **实现并系统评估附录中提出的防御思想**：研究如何动态调整“分块”大小或引入关键阶段的中途视觉重规划，以打破攻击所需的开环积分窗口。\n    - **探索多模态异常检测**：结合**运动学一致性检查**（如加加速度监测）、**视觉预期验证**（比较预测的末端轨迹与实时观察到的场景几何）以及**任务语义一致性分析**，构建更强大的入侵检测系统。\n    - **研究后门防御技术**：将针对图像分类等领域的后门检测与缓解技术（如激活聚类、神经元修剪、触发模式逆向工程）适配到时序性的VLA策略中。\n\n2.  **扩展到真实世界与更复杂场景**\n    - **进行实物机器人实验**：在真实的机械臂或移动操作平台上验证攻击的隐蔽性和破坏力，并评估其在面对真实世界噪声和不确定性时的鲁棒性。\n    - **测试更广泛的任务和模型**：将攻击评估扩展到更复杂的长期规划任务、人机协作场景，以及更多样化的VLA模型架构上，以全面理解其威胁范围。\n\n3.  **研究更隐蔽的触发机制**\n    - **探索自然、非数字的触发器**：研究如何利用自然环境中存在的、不易被数据清洗过滤的物体或模式（如特定纹理、日常物品的摆放、环境光线的特定变化）作为触发器，进一步提升攻击的物理隐蔽性。\n    - **研究无触发器或条件触发的后门**：探索是否可能创建仅在特定内部状态或外部环境条件满足时才激活的后门，从而完全消除外部可视触发器。\n\n4.  **深入分析漏洞的根本原因与架构安全设计**\n    - **形式化分析“开环”窗口的安全边界**：为“动作分块”设计提供理论上的安全指导，例如，基于任务关键性、环境不确定性动态确定最大安全分块大小。\n    - **设计具有内在安全意识的VLA架构**：从第一性原理出发，设计在追求效率（分块预测）的同时，**内置对累积误差的感知和容忍机制**，或集成轻量级的连续状态估计验证模块的新型模型架构。\n\n**总结**：SilentDrift论文的核心价值在于揭示了一个源于VLA主流设计模式（动作分块+增量位姿）的**根本性安全漏洞**，并设计了一种极具隐蔽性的攻击范式。其最主要的局限性在于研究的“双刃剑”属性、仿真环境的局限性以及防御方案的初步性。未来的工作必然将围绕**构建有效防御**、**验证真实世界威胁**以及**推动安全攸关的架构设计**这三个核心方向展开。",
