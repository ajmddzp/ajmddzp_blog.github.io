Interstitial brachytherapy (ISBT) is a standard procedure for treating cervical cancer; it involves placing a\nradioactive source through a straight hollow needle within or\nin close proximity to the tumor and surrounding tissue. However, the use of straight needles limits surgical planning to a linear needle path. We present the OncoReach stylet, a handheld, tendon-driven steerable stylet designed for compatibility with standard ISBT 15- and 13-gauge needles.\nBuilding upon our prior work, we evaluated design parameters like needle gauge, spherical joint count and spherical joint placement, including an asymmetric disk design to identify a configuration that maximizes bending compliance while retaining axial stiffness. Free space experiments quantified tip deflection across configurations, and a two-tube Cosserat rod model accurately predicted the centerline shape of the needle for most trials. The best performing configuration was integrated into a reusable handheld prototype that enables manual actuation. A patient-derived, multi-composite phantom model of the uterus and pelvis was developed to conduct a\npilot study\nof the OncoReach steerable stylet with one expert user. Results showed the ability to steer from less-invasive, medial entry points to reach the lateral-most targets, underscoring the significance of steerable stylets.\n1\nIntroduction\nCervical cancer incidence is increasing among 30 to 34-year-old women in the United States with an annual percentage change of\n2.5\n%\n2.5\\%\nfrom 2012 to 2019. An estimated 227,062 women were diagnosed with cervix cancer from 2001 to 2019, with approximately 20,697 women between the ages of 30 and 34 years old [\n1\n]. There are expected to be 13,360 additional cases of cervix cancer in the United States in 2025, with an estimated 4,320 deaths [\n2\n].\nGiven the rising incidence and mortality rates, there is a growing need for advancements in surgical procedures such as brachytherapy, which is a radiation therapy technique in which a radioactive source is placed within or adjacent to a tumor [\n3\n].\nAccurate needle positioning is essential for achieving highly conformal radiation therapy [\n4\n]. However, the use of straight needles restricts surgical planning to linear paths, which can be problematic when organs obstruct access to the tumor. These organs, known as organs at risk (OARs), pose significant challenges during needle placement.\nIn particular, the uterus is anteverted in about\n70\n​\n–\n​\n75\n%\n70–75\\%\nof women, in which the cervix and uterus tilt anteriorly toward the bladder, often complicating the insertion of the tandem (a metal tube inserted through the vaginal opening into the uterine canal) and needles during standard interstitial brachytherapy (ISBT) [\n5\n,\n6\n].\nTypically, these needles are manually inserted through a Syed template, which is a perforated plastic grid fixed to the perineum, to maintain their parallel alignment [\n7\n].\nThese anatomical challenges reduce the accuracy and efficiency of brachytherapy treatment delivery, with the concomitant requirement for more interstitial needles to target the tumor as accurately as possible [\n8\n].\nA clinical case of a markedly anteverted uterus is illustrated in Fig.\n1\n. This case presents a tumor involving the entire cervix and uterus treated with interstitial brachytherapy needles and a uterine tandem. Fig.\n1\n(a, b) depicts axial and sagittal views of ISBT using straight needles and straight stylet (a rigid metallic rod to guide needle placement) to treat the tumor. With straight stylet, the brachytherapy plan can safely cover only the medial portion of the tumor (red outline) as shown by the\n100\n%\n100\\%\nprescription isodose line (yellow outline). The needles cannot advance further to reach the entire tumor due to the risk of puncturing the sigmoid colon. In contrast, Fig.\n1\n(c, d) showcases the axial and sagittal views, respectively, of a proposed steerable needle plan, highlighting its advantages. The steerable needles can safely advance to the uterine fundus, enabling\n100\n%\n100\\%\nprescription dose coverage of the anterior, inferior, and lateral portions of the uterus.\n{figurehere}\nMRI images of a tumor involving the cervix and uterus treated with brachytherapy. (a) Axial view and (b) sagittal view of standard interstitial brachytherapy (ISBT) using straight needles. (c) Axial view and (d) sagittal view of a hypothetical ISBT plan using steerable needles.\nThis plan enables greater tumor coverage and, consequently, improved targeting accuracy whilst avoiding puncturing other vital organs in the surrounding area. This approach may also reduce the number of needles required during treatment, potentially decreasing the typical count from 15-20 needles to significantly fewer [\n8\n].\nPrevious studies have explored the development of robotic steerable stylets for brachytherapy. Gunderman et al. [\n9\n] developed a tendon-actuated deflectable stylet equipped with MR-active tracking. They use agar and porcine tissue samples to test their stylet.\nOther designs [\n10\n,\n11\n,\n12\n] have explored tendon-driven continuum robots with a micro-machined stylet.\nHowever, these designs have limited axial rigidity, which restricts their ability to generate controlled curvature within the tissue.\nIn our previous work [\n8\n], we addressed this design limitation by developing a tendon-assisted, magnetically steerable robotic stylet that incorporates magnetic spherical joints and is designed for insertion into 15-gauge ISBT plastic needles.\nWe achieved significant tip deflection both in free space and within gelatin-based phantom tissue.\nAlthough our previous work demonstrated that dual actuation (magnetic plus tendon) produced greater tip deflection in free space compared to single-mode actuation, the in-vitro experiments using phantom tissue with stiffness comparable to human tissue showed that the curvature achieved with dual actuation was comparable to that obtained with tendon-only actuation (see Fig.\n1\n).\n{figurehere}\nComparison of a steerable needle configurations under different actuation modes [\n8\n]. (a) Dual actuation using tendon and magnets and (b) tendon-only actuation. (c) Comparison of both methods to straight stylets.\nIn this work, we developed a non-magnetic, tendon-driven steerable stylet with a handheld controller\n(Section\n2\n)\n. Multiple design parameters are systematically evaluated and validated with a proposed mechanical model\n(Section\n3\n)\nto identify the most effective configuration.\nIn parallel, a high-fidelity uterus-and-pelvis phantom model was developed to emulate the mechanical stiffness comparable to that of human tissue (Section\n4\n). Free-space testing of the stylet designs are conducted, and the best-performing design is integrated into a novel handheld prototype (Section\n5\n). The handheld design is then validated with an expert user who inserted the OncoReach stylet into the uterus-and-pelvis phantom. Finally, Section\n6\nsummarizes findings and discusses future work.\n2\nDesign\n2.1\nFront-end and Back-end Design\nFig.\n2.1\n(a) illustrates the overall setup of the system. The front-end consists of the needle-stylet assembly, in which the stylet is inserted coaxially into a commercially available brachytherapy needle (Best Medical International, Inc., Springfield, VA, USA).\nFig.\n2.1\n(b) illustrates the OncoReach stylet, which consists of a nickel-titanium (nitinol) tube integrated with connected spherical joints separated by 3D-printed routing disks. Each disk incorporates four channels to guide the tendons. By selectively actuating individual tendons, the stylet bends toward the corresponding direction of the applied tendon force. Multiple variations of the routing disks are designed for this study.\nFig.\n2.1\n(c) presents a\n1.4\n1.4\nmm diameter disk compatible with 15-gauge needles, while Fig.\n2.1\n(d) shows the cross-sectional view of a same-sized disk used at the nitinol tube interface. Since the tube’s inner diameter is smaller than the routing path inside the\n{figurehere}\nOncoReach stylet design.\n(a) System overview showing the tendon-actuation system, needle-stylet, and tracking markers for shape measurement.\n(b) Stylet design. (c) Routing disks for 15 gauge needle. (d) Cross-section of tilted tendon channels for smooth routing. (e) Routing disks for 13 gauge needles. (f) Asymmetric single-tendon disk with offset ball bearing for enhanced bending.\ndisk, the tendon channels are inclined to ensure smooth tendon passage between the tube and disk assembly. Fig.\n2.1\n(e) shows a\n1.95\n1.95\nmm version designed for 13-gauge needles.\nThe corresponding nitinol tubes have inner and outer radii of\nR\nin\n=\n0.533\nR_{\\text{in}}=0.533\nmm and\nR\nout\n=\n0.673\nR_{\\text{out}}=0.673\nmm for the 15-gauge tube, and\nR\nin\n=\n0.747\nR_{\\text{in}}=0.747\nmm and\nR\nout\n=\n0.965\nR_{\\text{out}}=0.965\nmm for the 13-gauge tube, as specified by the manufacturer.\nBoth configurations in Fig.\n2.1\n(c) and\n2.1\n(e) employ a\n0.8\n0.8\nmm stainless-steel ball bearing at the center, functioning as a spherical joint. In contrast, Fig.\n2.1\n(f) depicts an asymmetric, single-tendon-routed disk in which the ball bearing is offset to one side and the tendon channel is positioned on the opposite side. This arrangement increases the moment arm generated by the tendon force, thereby enhancing bending compliance.\nAdditionally, we investigate the effects of joint placement along the stylet body. Three configurations are tested, with the spherical joints positioned near the base, midsection, and distal end of the stylet. Finally, to study the influence of joint count, we test stylet prototypes with 15, 20, and 30 spherical joints.\nAt the back-end, an\nϕ\n​\n8\n\\phi 8\nmm DC motor (Maxon Metal Brushes, 0.5 W, Maxon international ltd., Switzerland) coupled to a lead screw converts rotary motion into linear displacement. The motion drives a\n5\n5\nlb load cell (MDB-5, Transducer Techniques) for real-time tendon tension measurement. A nitinol tendon is fixed to the load cell, allowing precise tension control via a closed-loop PID controller implemented in MATLAB/Simulink using a Texas Instruments LAUNCHXL-F28379D LaunchPad.\n2.2\nHandheld Prototype Design\nTo enhance clinical usability, a handheld, single-direction prototype was then developed (see Fig.\n2.2\n). This design allows for manual insertion and steering by using a finger grip to actuate the tendon directly. The grip slides on a\n3\n3\nmm guide shaft supported by linear ball bearings to ensure smooth motion. Pulling the grip controls stylet bending via a connector at the shaft’s distal end, providing the operator with intuitive manual control during tissue insertion. Because the bending direction is constant, the user must rotate his or her wrist to adjust the steering orientation.\n{figurehere}\nHandheld prototype design of the OncoReach stylet and needle.\n3\nMechanical Model\nIn this section, we present a two-tube Cosserat rod model to predict the shape of the system in free space under applied tendon tension.\nIn contrast to [\n8\n], the model proposed here provides a more accurate representation of the relative shear and axial dilation along the shared centerline.\n3.1\nStatic Model\nThe proposed model incorporates both the stylet and the needle: the stylet, referred to as tube\n1\n1\n(inner tube), and the needle, referred to as tube\n2\n2\n(outer tube). Both tubes share a common centerline but can twist and elongate/contract independently along their lengths. Figure\n3.1\ndepicts the system design parameters and the local material frames associated with each tube.

The third director\n\\bm\n​\nd\n3\n\\bm{d}_{3}\n, normal to the cross-section, is common to both tubes, i.e.,\n\\bm\n​\nd\n3\n=\n\\bm\n​\nd\n3\n,\ni\n\\bm{d}_{3}=\\bm{d}_{3,i}\nfor all\ni\n∈\n[\n1\n,\n2\n]\ni\\in[1,2]\n.

In addition to relative twisting, the tubes experience axial dilation during actuation. The dilation factor of tube 2, denoted as\ne\n2\ne_{2}\n, is defined relative to tube 1 as\nβ\n=\ne\n2\n/\ne\n1\n\\beta=e_{2}/e_{1}\n.\nFor a Cosserat rod subjected to distributed force\n\\bm\n​\nf\ni\n∈\nℝ\n3\n\\bm{f}_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}\nand moment\n\\bm\n​\nτ\ni\n∈\nℝ\n3\n\\bm{\\tau}_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}\nper unit length, the static equilibrium equations are given by [\n14\n]:\n[\n\\bm\n​\nn\n˙\ni\n\\bm\n​\nm\n˙\ni\n]\n+\n[\n[\n\\bm\n​\nu\ni\n]\n𝟎\n[\n\\bm\n​\nv\ni\n]\n[\n\\bm\n​\nu\ni\n]\n]\n​\n[\n\\bm\n​\nn\ni\n\\bm\n​\nm\ni\n]\n+\n[\n\\bm\n​\nf\ni\n\\bm\n​\nτ\ni\n]\n=\n𝟎\n\\displaystyle\\begin{bmatrix}\\dot{\\bm{n}}_{i}\\\\[3.0pt]\n\\dot{\\bm{m}}_{i}\\end{bmatrix}+\\begin{bmatrix}[\\bm{u}_{i}]&\\mathbf{0}\\\\[3.0pt]\n[\\bm{v}_{i}]&[\\bm{u}_{i}]\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}\\bm{n}_{i}\\\\[3.0pt]\n\\bm{m}_{i}\\end{bmatrix}+\\begin{bmatrix}\\bm{f}_{i}\\\\[3.0pt]\n\\bm{\\tau}_{i}\\end{bmatrix}=\\mathbf{0}\n(2)\nAssuming linear elasticity, the internal force and moment are related to the strain variables through the constitutive model:\n[\n\\bm\n​\nn\ni\n\\bm\n​\nm\ni\n]\n=\n[\nK\ns\n​\ne\n,\ni\n𝟎\n𝟎\nK\nb\n​\nt\n,\ni\n]\n​\n[\n\\bm\n​\nv\ni\n−\n\\bm\n​\nv\ni\n∗\n\\bm\n​\nu\ni\n−\n\\bm\n​\nu\ni\n∗\n]\n\\displaystyle\\begin{bmatrix}\\bm{n}_{i}\\\\\n\\bm{m}_{i}\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}K_{se,i}&\\mathbf{0}\\\\\n\\mathbf{0}&K_{bt,i}\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}\\bm{v}_{i}-\\bm{v}^{*}_{i}\\\\\n\\bm{u}_{i}-\\bm{u}^{*}_{i}\\end{bmatrix}\n(3)\nwhere\nK\ns\n​\ne\n,\ni\n=\ndiag\n​\n(\nG\n​\nA\ni\n,\nG\n​\nA\ni\n,\nE\n​\nA\ni\n)\nK_{se,i}=\\mathrm{diag}(GA_{i},GA_{i},EA_{i})\nand\nK\nb\n​\nt\n,\ni\n=\ndiag\n​\n(\nE\n​\nI\nd\n1\n,\ni\n,\nE\n​\nI\nd\n2\n,\ni\n,\nG\n​\nJ\nd\n3\n,\ni\n)\nK_{bt,i}=\\mathrm{diag}(EI_{d_{1},i},EI_{d_{2},i},GJ_{d_{3},i})\nare stiffness matrix for shear and axial elongation, and stiffness matrix for bending and torsion, respectively.\nA\ni\nA_{i}\nis the cross-sectional area of the tube,\nE\nE\nis Young’s modulus,\nG\nG\nis the shear modulus.\nI\nd\n1\nI_{d_{1}}\nand\nI\nd\n2\nI_{d_{2}}\nrepresent the second moments of area of the tube’s cross section about the principal axes, while\nJ\nd\n3\n,\ni\nJ_{d_{3},i}\ndenotes the polar moment of inertia of the cross section about the\nd\n3\nd_{3}\naxis.

(b) 3D model of CT-segmented pelvis with positive mold for pelvic tissue. (c) Top view of pelvic tissue mold with target positions. (d) Assembled phantom model (transverse view).\nThe uterus phantom model (Fig.\n4.1\n(a)) uses the methodology from [\n17\n], in which negative molds of the uterus (average dimensions derived from a 50-patient data study [\n18\n]) are PLA 3D printed (Ultimaker S3, Utrecht, Netherlands) for pouring of the hollow uterine shell.\n4.2\nPelvis Phantom Model\nThe pelvis model, shown in Fig.\n4.1\n(b), is derived from a de-identified patient CT scan in which medical imaging software (3DSlicer [\n19\n]) is used to segment the pelvis using a Hounsfield Unit (HU) thresholding technique, followed by manual segmentation. The 3D volume is then exported as a stereolithogrpahy (STL) file and imported into 3D mesh modeling software (Meshmixer), in which any residual noise is removed. The pelvis is further modified in Meshmixer to contain only the pubic symphysis, ischiopubic ramus, and illium. The updated STL file is then uploaded to CAD software to create holes for standoffs in the phantom model. The finalized pelvis model is then resin 3D-printed (Formlabs 3BL, Somerville, MA, USA) with clear resin and spray-painted white (Rust-Oleum, Vemon Hills, IL, USA).\n4.3\nPelvic Tissue Phantom Model\nThe pelvic tissue comprises of tissue simulation Humimic gel (SimuGel 3, Humimic, Greenville, SC, USA) with a Young’s modulus of 0.19 MPa,\ndensity of 856.839 kg/m\n3\n, and speed of sound of 1458.85 m/s\n, which has been validated to mimic the properties of human tissue during brachytherapy procedures [\n18\n,\n17\n,\n20\n]. The geometry of the tissue is arbitrarily determined by importing a sphere mesh appended inside the pelvic cavity of the modified pelvis model, as depicted in Fig.\n4.1\n(b). The sphere mesh is then shaped until a tissue volume with no intersections into the pelvis is formed. The tissue model is then imported into CAD software to create a mold. Insertion holes for 10 mm outer diameter (OD) target molds are designed into the interior shell of the mold, positioned as shown in Fig.\n4.1\n(c). 15 mm tall targets are placed 60\n°\n\\degree\napart along a circular path with outer diameter (OD) of 65 mm. Similarly, 5 mm tall targets are placed along an 80 mm OD circle. In addition, an extrusion of 35 mm on the inferior side of the mold is made to represent the tissue surrounding the vaginal canal. The top lid of the mold has a built-in positive mold to create a negative space for the vaginal canal with dimensions designed to accommodate the insertion of the vaginal obturator, as well as an extrusion to hold the uterus model in free space while the Humimic gel cures (Fig.\n4.1\n(a)). The mold is then split into two parts and printed (Bambu X1C, Shenzhen, China) with screw holes for locking and securing.\n4.4\nModel Formation and Assembly\nThe uterus model is formed by first casting silicone (Smooth-on Mold Star Silicone 20T, Easton, PA, USA) inside the mold. Once an exterior shell of the silicone uterus is cured, the uterus is cut to remove the internal portion of the PLA mold, and Humimic gel is melted into a liquid form at approximately 200\n°\n\\degree\nC and poured into the hollow uterine shell. Once cast, the phantom is set to rest until cured. Silicone is then cast over the cured Humimic gel to seal off the casting entry point of the uterus.\nOnce the uterus model is complete, the curved extrusion on the top lid of the pelvic tissue mold is inserted into the Humimic region of the uterus. The target molds are placed in their respective slots, and mold release (Smooth-On Universal Mold Release, Macungie, PA, USA) is sprayed on the interior of the pelvic tissue mold. The pelvic tissue mold is assembled, and Humimic gel solution is then poured into the mold and set to rest for three hours. The pelvic tissue mold is then disassembled, and the Humimic gel with embedded uterus is removed from the mold. The resulting phantom model has a vaginal canal present in the Humimic tissue which connects to the internal silicone uterus (Fig.\n4.1\n(d)). Stock acrylic board (McMaster-Carr, Elmhurst, IL, USA) is then laser-cut to serve as the base, shown in Fig.\n4.1\n(d). 3D-printed stands for the pelvic tissue model and ischium are secured onto the acrylic board. The pelvic tissue is placed on the stand, then the pelvis is placed above to secure the pelvic tissue.\n5\nExperiments and Results\nA series of experiments are conducted to identify the best-performing OncoReach stylet configuration that achieves high bending compliance while maintaining sufficient axial stiffness. Trials are performed by varying the needle and stylet gauges, the number of spherical joints (15, 20, and 30), and the joint placement along the stylet (base, midsection, and tip)\nin free-space\n. An additional asymmetric single-tendon-routed design is also evaluated. The mechanical model described in Section\n3\nis validated experimentally, and a handheld trial is subsequently performed. Finally, OncoReach stylet is deployed by an expert user in the phantom model for a\npilot study\nof the tool.\n{tablehere}\n\\tbl\nMaximum tip deflection across OncoReach stylet configurations.”ga” indicates needle gauge, ”Joints” the number of spherical joints, and parentheses denote joint placement.\n\\toprule\nConfiguration\nTendon\nTip\nTension (N)\nDeflection (mm)\n\\colrule\n15 ga.-20 Joints (Tip)\n9.9\n9.87\n13 ga.-20 Joints (Tip)\n14.0\n6.49\n15 ga.-15 Joints (Tip)\n10.0\n8.98\n15 ga.-30 Joints (Tip)\n9.9\n11.05\n15 ga.-20 Joints (Base)\n9.9\n29.40\n15 ga.-20 Joints (Mid)\n10.0\n20.00\n15 ga.-20 Joints (Asym.)\n9.9\n11.34\n\\botrule\nWhile base and midsection joint placements produce greater displacement, they are incompatible with the Syed template (see Section\n1\n). Additionally, the asymmetric configuration was structurally unstable and required excessive reassembly. Therefore, the 15-gauge configuration with 30 joints at the tip was selected for the pilot study.\n5.1\nFree-Space Experimental Setup\nThe experimental setup, shown in Fig.\n2.1\n(a), is used for all free-space trials. Five reflective markers are placed along each needle and tracked using four Vero v2.2 motion-capture cameras (Vicon Motion Systems Ltd., United Kingdom). An additional set of five markers at the robot base define a global reference frame for the system. Table\n5\nsummarizes the maximum tip deflection measured for each configuration.\nAs shown in Table\n5\n, the 15 gauge configuration exhibits greater bending compliance than the 13 gauge design, even though the latter is actuated with a higher tendon tension (\n14\n14\nN compared to\n9.9\n9.9\nN). Although the needle cross-sectional areas are nearly identical, the\n13\n13\ngauge stylet has a cross-sectional area\n2.21\n2.21\ntimes larger than that of the 15 gauge stylet. Consequently, the second moment of area (\nI\nI\n) increases by approximately\n4.47\n4.47\ntimes, resulting in greater axial stiffness and reduced bending compliance across the system. The configuration with\n30\n30\nspherical joints demonstrates greater bending compliance than those with\n15\n15\nor\n20\n20\njoints. This behavior arises because the articulated spherical joint section of the stylet has lower bending stiffness than the nitinol stem. The experimentally measured bending stiffness matrix for the spherical joint section is\nK\nb\n​\nt\n,\njoints\n=\ndiag\n​\n(\n[\n0.0008\n,\n0.0008\n,\n0.0047\n]\n)\nK_{bt,\\text{joints}}=\\mathrm{diag}([0.0008,~0.0008,~0.0047])\n,\nwhich remained constant across all trials. Conversely,\nthe bending stiffness matrix for the nitinol tube section, calculated from the tube geometry and material properties provided by the manufacturer, is\nK\nb\n​\nt\n,\ntube\n=\ndiag\n​\n(\n[\n0.0062\n,\n0.0062\n,\n0.0047\n]\n)\nK_{bt,\\text{tube}}=\\mathrm{diag}([0.0062,~0.0062,~0.0047])\n. Therefore, increasing the length of spherical joints improves bending compliance but can result in buckling during insertion through the Syed template, a planar template with evenly-spaced needle holes. Placing the low-stiffness joint section near the base produced the highest tip deflection, followed by the midsection, while the tip configuration showed the least. The asymmetric design, with a larger\nr\na\n​\nr\n​\nm\nr_{arm}\n, generated greater tip deflection than the symmetric configuration.\n5.2\nMechanical Model Validation\nFigure 1:\nComparison between the model-predicted centerline (red) and experimental ground-truth data (black markers) for various configurations of the stylet and needle.\n(a-c) depict 15-gauge needle-stylet assembly configurations with varying spherical joint counts.\n(d-e) present configurations with 20 spherical joints while varying placement from the base to the midsection of the stylet.\nFigure\n1\nillustrates the predicted and experimentally measured shapes of the\n15\n15\ngauge needle-stylet configurations with varying spherical joint counts and positions.\nFor the model, the elastic and shear moduli of the nitinol tube are set to\nE\n1\n=\n68\n​\nGPa\nE_{1}=68~\\text{GPa}\nand\nG\n1\n=\n25.5\n​\nGPa\nG_{1}=25.5~\\text{GPa}\nrespectively, while values for the needle are\nE\n2\n=\n3.2\n​\nGPa\nE_{2}=3.2~\\text{GPa}\nand\nG\n2\n=\n1.06\n​\nGPa\nG_{2}=1.06~\\text{GPa}\n.\nThe Euclidean distance between the model-predicted and measured tip positions is calculated for the maximum applied tendon tension in each trial (approximately\n10\n10\nN).\nWhen varying the number of spherical joints from\n15\n15\nto\n30\n30\n, the model-predicted tip position error is\n1.74\n1.74\nmm (less than\n1\n%\n1\\%\nof total length) for\n15\n15\njoints,\n2.2\n2.2\nmm (\n1.1\n%\n1.1\\%\nof total length) for 20 joints, and\n2.33\n2.33\nmm (\n1.1\n%\n1.1\\%\nof total length) for 30 joints.\nSubsequently, the joint position is varied along the stylet, from tip to midsection to base, while maintaining 20 spherical joints.\nAlthough the overall tip deflection increases when the joint section is positioned closer to the base, the model error remains low (\n1.36\n%\n1.36\\%\nof total length) for the midsection configuration but increases to\n11.16\n11.16\nmm (\n5.6\n%\n5.6\\%\nof total length) when the joints are positioned at the base.\nThis higher discrepancy likely arises because\nK\nb\n​\nt\nK_{bt}\nfor the articulated joint section is determined experimentally\nand held constant. Given the\n33\n33\nmm joint section, stiffness variations are negligible at the tip but propagate and amplify error when located at the base. While\nK\nb\n​\nt\nK_{bt}\ncould be estimated via the Parallel Axis Theorem, internal friction between ball bearings and disks makes this approach unreliable. A more accurate method would involve directly measuring joint stiffness through independent experiments. Current reliance on a constant\nK\nb\n​\nt\nK_{bt}\nis a limitation, as it may not fully capture the mechanical behavior of each joint section.\n5.3\nOncoReach\nPilot Study\nA clinical expert (N = 1) is recruited for the OncoReach\npilot study.\nThe simulation consists of the proposed clinical use workflow:\n•\nInsert tandem and obturator into uterus using an ultrasound imaging system (SonoSite M-Turbo, FUJIFILM, Bothel, Washington, USA) (Fig.\n5.3\n(a-c)).\n•\nApply template up to the pelvic phantom (Fig.\n5.3\n(d)).\n•\nInsert straight and steered needles towards the Anterior, Medial, and Posterior targets.\n•\nCharacterize maximum achievable curvature and evaluate the capacity to reach target areas from restricted, less-invasive entry points.\nFig.\n2\n(a) shows the template entry points for both straight needle and OncoReach trials, which are symmetric on opposite sides of the template. Note that for the Medial targets, however, a more central template entry point is chosen for\nthe OncoReach Trial to demonstrate the ability to steer from a\nless-invasive\nentry point (transvaginal entry). The phantom is then imaged using a Brilliance Big Bore CT (Philips, Amsterdam, Netherlands) with a\n1\n1\nmm slice thickness, and radiopaque fish wire is inserted into each plastic needle to better visualize the needle paths.\nThe CT images were then imported into the BrachyVision treatment planning system (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA, USA) for image analysis and measurements.\n{figurehere}\nPilot study setup: phantom with Syed template and tandem attached.\n(a) Expert user using the ultrasound probe to visualize tandem inside uterus. (b) Tandem entering the Humimic gel inside the uterus. (c) Obturator fitting inside the vaginal cavity. (d)\nPilot study\nsetup.\nThe clinical expert can successfully visualize the tandem entering the uterus through the Humimic gel using the ultrasound probe (Fig.\n5.3\n(a-b)). Both the tandem and vaginal obturator successfully enter the uterus and vaginal cavity (Fig.\n5.3\n(c)), respectively. The template then successfully slides along the obturator and sits flush on the Humimic pelvic tissue (Fig.\n5.3\n(d)), showing appropriate anatomical and clinical accuracy in model and model use. However, the pelvis tissue model visually is opaque, preventing users to assess where the needle is with respect to the target. This can be due to the mold release that mixes with the cast Humimic gel solution while curing.\nFigure 2:\nNeedle insertion results. (a) Inferior view of the phantom, highlighting entry points and their respective CT sub-figures (target location - straight/steered): (b) Anterior-Straight, (c) Anterior-Steered, (d) Medial-Straight, (e) Medial-Steered, (f) Posterior-Straight, (g) Posterior-Steered.\n{tablehere}\n\\tbl\nOncoReach\nPilot Study\nResults\n\\toprule\nTarget Type - Needle Type\nTip\nDeflection (mm)\n\\colrule\nAnterior-Straight\nN/A\nAnterior-Steered\n12.6\nMedial-Straight\n5.8\nMedial-Steered\n15.8\nPosterior-Straight\n13.6\nPosterior-Steered\n24.0\n\\botrule\nDuring these insertions, tendon tension is manually modulated by the clinician to adjust the trajectory towards the target region.\nThe OncoReach system can properly load and unload a standard 15-gauge brachytherapy needle. The loaded needle can then properly enter the template and the tissue. Fig.\n2\n(a) shows the entry points chosen for both straight and OncoReach-steered needles, and Fig.\n2\n(b-f) shows the CT scans of the resulting needle placement experiments.\nTable\n2\nreports the tip deflection manually measured in the BrachyVision treatment planning software.\nNote that the Anterior-Straight tip deflection is reported as N/A; the tip deflection was too minimal to measure in the software. Throughout all trials, the OncoReach system is properly bending the needle, allowing for a curved trajectory towards the desired anterior, middle, and posterior targets. In the anterior test to the 5 mm target, the straight needle in Fig.\n2\n(b) enters the pelvic tissue in a linear fashion to reach the target, whereas the steered needle in Fig.\n2\n(c) successfully traversed the most anterior target by 12.6 mm compared to the anterior straight needle. The mid-plane target trials show that, despite entry from a more medial template hole, the OncoReach system is still able to reach the lateral-most target on the mid-plane (Fig.\n2\n(e)). This shows the potential and benefits of steerable stylets, which can allow the radiation oncologist to choose a less invasive approach compared to a more lateral entry point, such as the Medial-Straight trial shown in Fig.\n2\n(d). In the posterior target trials, as the target is hard to see due to the cloudiness of the Humimic gel, both straight and steered needle trials are attempted with the phantom inverted to provide visual feedback.\nThe lateral deflections of\n12.6\n−\n24.0\n12.6-24.0\nmm achieved in this study provide a corrective capability that addresses clinical needs. Studies of conventional gynecologic brachytherapy needle placement report average transverse tip deflections of\n3.6\n±\n2.1\n3.6\\pm 2.1\nmm to\n7.9\n±\n3.0\n7.9\\pm 3.0\nmm [\n21\n]. By exceeding these typical error magnitudes, the system demonstrates the curvature required to compensate for placement uncertainties encountered in practice.\nThe Posterior-Straight trial (Fig.\n2\n(f)) resulted in final needle placement closer to the desired posterior 15 mm target compared to the Posterior-Steered trial ((Fig.\n2\n(g)). This can be attributed to the Syed template sagging, resulting in an angled needle entry and continued trajectory. Additionally, the inability to assess the orientation of the needle tip (i.e. steering direction) once the distal tip entered the tissue is a common observation throughout all trials.\n6\nDiscussions and Conclusions\nIn this work, we present the design and\npilot study\nof a steerable stylet for ISBT applications. Various routing disk designs are experimentally tested in free space, and a mechanical model is developed to predict the robot’s shape under applied tendon tension. When the spherical joints are positioned at the tip or midsection, the tip-position error remains below\n2\n%\n2\\%\nof the needle length. However, when the spherical joints are placed near the base, error propagation along the length increases the tip-position error to\n5.6\n%\n5.6\\%\n.\nThe 15-gauge configuration with 30 spherical joints positioned at the tip was selected for the pilot study. A pilot study was conducted with a single expert user to evaluate the clinical feasibility of the device. The results demonstrated that the handheld device is functional and capable of reaching lateral targets from a safer, medial entry point-a trajectory achievable only through needle steering.\n6.1\nLimitation and Future Work\nAlthough the first pilot study for the OncoReach stylet shows promising translational potential, the current study has several limitations. First, the pilot study consists of a single expert user (\nN\n=\n1\nN=1\n), which demonstrates the feasibility of the system but does not provide statistical data on generalizable performance or broad clinical usability. A larger user study is required to validate the system’s learning curve and consistency across different users.\nSecond, the current mechanical model is validated only in free space. It does not account for reaction forces from homogeneous or heterogeneous tissue. While the device successfully achieved curvature in the phantom, accurate trajectory prediction in a clinical setting will require integrating tissue-force models and implementing real-time feedback control to compensate for unmodeled disturbances. Finally, due to the opacity of the phantom tissue, real-time visualization of targeting during insertion and quantification of tip position accuracy are not possible.\nFuture work will focus on developing a transparent, tissue-mimicking phantom, integrating real-time shape sensing for feedback control, conducting repeatability tests in both free-space and in the phantom model, and conducting a comprehensive preclinical evaluation with a larger group of expert users.\n\\nonumsection\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported in part by a grant from the University of Louisville School of Medicine.\nReferences\n[1]\nZ. Shahmoradi, H. Damgacioglu, M. A.

    "preview_text": "Cervical cancer accounts for a significant portion of the global cancer burden among women. Interstitial brachytherapy (ISBT) is a standard procedure for treating cervical cancer; it involves placing a radioactive source through a straight hollow needle within or in close proximity to the tumor and surrounding tissue. However, the use of straight needles limits surgical planning to a linear needle path. We present the OncoReach stylet, a handheld, tendon-driven steerable stylet designed for compatibility with standard ISBT 15- and 13-gauge needles. Building upon our prior work, we evaluated design parameters like needle gauge, spherical joint count and spherical joint placement, including an asymmetric disk design to identify a configuration that maximizes bending compliance while retaining axial stiffness. Free space experiments quantified tip deflection across configurations, and a two-tube Cosserat rod model accurately predicted the centerline shape of the needle for most trials. The best performing configuration was integrated into a reusable handheld prototype that enables manual actuation. A patient-derived, multi-composite phantom model of the uterus and pelvis was developed to conduct a pilot study of the OncoReach steerable stylet with one expert user. Results showed the ability to steer from less-invasive, medial entry points to reach the lateral-most targets, underscoring the significance of steerable stylets.\n\n\\catchline\n002013\nThe OncoReach Stylet for Brachytherapy:\nDesign Evaluation and\nPilot Study\nPejman Kheradmand\na*\nKent K.
