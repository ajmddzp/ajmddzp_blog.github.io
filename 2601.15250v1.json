While feed-forward methods have made progress, they often struggle to generate plausible details in occluded regions and preserve the fundamental spatial relationships of objects. Such accurate generative reasoning capability for the entire 3D space is critical in real-world applications. In this paper, we present FlowSSC, the first generative framework applied directly to monocular semantic scene completion. FlowSSC treats the SSC task as a conditional generation problem and can seamlessly integrate with existing feed-forward SSC methods to significantly boost their performance. To achieve real-time inference without compromising quality, we introduce Shortcut Flow-matching that operates in a compact triplane latent space. Unlike standard diffusion models that require hundreds of steps, our method utilizes a shortcut mechanism to achieve high-fidelity generation in a single step, enabling practical deployment in autonomous systems. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI demonstrate that FlowSSC achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baselines.\nI\nINTRODUCTION\nFigure 1\n:\nVisualizing the Shortcut Refinement Process. Our model learns a continuous flow from noise (\nx\n0\nx_{0}\n) to data (\nx\n1\nx_{1}\n) in the compact triplane latent space. By optimizing the Self-Consistency objective, the model acquires the ability to perform a direct ”Shortcut” jump for real-time inference, while retaining the capability for multi-step refinement. The refined triplanes are decoded into high-fidelity 3D semantic scenes with fine details.\n(a)\nVAE Architecture\n(b)\nFlowSSC Pipeline Overview\nFigure 2\n:\nOverview of FlowSSC. (a) VecSet VAE compresses 3D voxels into compact triplane latent via Cross-Attention. (b) Overall pipeline: coarse triplane is encoded and refined through Shortcut Latent Diffusion.\nSemantic Scene Completion (SSC) has emerged as a fundamental task in 3D scene understanding, which aims to simultaneously complete the geometry of a 3D scene and predict semantic labels for all voxels, including those that are occluded or not directly visible. This capability is particularly crucial for a wide range of applications such as autonomous driving, robotic navigation, and augmented reality, where a comprehensive understanding of the environment is essential for safe and intelligent decision-making. However, this task remains highly challenging due to severe occlusions, viewpoint limitations, and the inherent ambiguity of inferring 3D structure from limited input data.\nTo address these challenges, many existing approaches rely on feed-forward models\n[\n2\n,\n10\n]\nthat directly map 2D images to 3D voxel grids. While these methods have achieved impressive results in visible regions, they fundamentally struggle with the ”one-to-many” mapping problem inherent in monocular scene completion. When improving occluded regions, feed-forward models tend to produce blurry or mean-valued predictions because they are trained to minimize reconstruction errors, which penalizes the high-frequency details that constitute realistic scene structure. On the other hand, generative diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capability in synthesizing high-fidelity details and handling uncertainty. However, their standard iterative sampling process requires hundreds of function evaluations, making them prohibitively slow for real-time applications like autonomous driving.\nTo bridge this gap, we propose\nFlowSSC\n, a novel framework that brings the power of generative modeling to monocular SSC while maintaining real-time inference speeds. We position FlowSSC as a\nuniversal\ngenerative enhancement framework: it can seamlessly integrate with any existing SSC method and significantly uplift its performance through a fast, generative refinement process.\nOur approach overcomes the speed-quality trade-off through two key technical innovations. First, instead of operating in the high-dimensional voxel space (\n256\n×\n256\n×\n32\n256\\times 256\\times 32\n), we employ a VecSet VAE\n[\n23\n]\narchitecture. Unlike standard autoencoders, our VAE leverages Cross-Attention to compress semantic voxels into a compact Triplane latent space, achieving superior reconstruction fidelity (85.89% IoU) while drastically reducing the computational complexity for the diffusion model. Second, we introduce a High-Efficiency Generative Refiner. Specifically, we employ a Triplane Diffusion Transformer as the refiner architecture to effectively aggregate 3D contextual information. To ensure real-time inference, we utilize the Shortcut Models\n[\n6\n]\ntraining strategy. This approach enables our DiT to learn a direct ”shortcut” mapping from noise to clean data without requiring a pre-trained teacher\n1\n, achieving high-fidelity generation in a single step while maintaining the flexibility for multi-step refinement.\nIn summary, our main contributions are as follows:\n•\nWe propose FlowSSC, the first universal generative framework for monocular Semantic Scene Completion.\n•\nWe incorporate a powerful VecSet VAE that utilizes Cross-Attention to compress 3D scenes into a compact Triplane representation, enabling efficient high-resolution generative modeling.\n•\nWe implement a Shortcut Latent Diffusion model that achieves state-of-the-art generation quality with One-Step inference, making generative SSC practical for real-time applications.\nExtensive experiments on SemanticKITTI\n[\n1\n]\ndemonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness of our one-step generative strategy.\nII\nRELATED WORK\nSemantic scene completion (SSC) has been widely studied in recent years, with existing approaches broadly categorized into multi-sensor fusion methods and monocular vision-based methods. We briefly review both lines of work below.\nII-A\nMulti-Sensor Fusion for Semantic Scene Completion\nIn the realm of multi-sensor fusion, SSCNet\n[\n14\n]\npioneers the field by formulating the task of inferring complete 3D scene geometry and semantics from limited observations.\nFollowing SSCNet, numerous methods have been proposed to enhance the performance of SSC by leveraging various sensor modalities such as LiDAR point clouds. For instance, JS3CNet\n[\n20\n]\nintroduces a sparse semantic scene completion network that capitalizes on LiDAR point clouds to improve completion performance through learning contextual shape priors. S3CNet\n[\n3\n]\nis designed to efficiently process large-scale outdoor scenes by predicting dense 3D structure and semantic labels from a single LiDAR point cloud.\nRecently, SurroundOcc\n[\n19\n]\ninnovatively predicts dense 3D occupancy from multi-camera images by generating dense ground truth labels using multi-frame LiDAR scans and Poisson Reconstruction.\nThe fusion-based models using have shown great performance by aligning LiDAR point clouds with image features through cross-modal attention or projection-based methods. However, the need for precise sensor calibration and synchronization limits their scalability and practicality in real-world applications.\nII-B\nVision-Based Monocular Semantic Scene Completion\nVision-based approaches aim to infer the 3D geometry and semantics directly from 2D images by learning to project and reason across the spatial domain. Early work like SPVCNN\n[\n18\n]\nintroduces a lightweight Sparse Point-Voxel Convolution module to enhance 3D scene understanding from monocular RGB images. MonoScene\n[\n2\n]\nis a pioneering effort that directly predicts semantic occupancy from a single RGB image by employing a feature lifting and projection module to map 2D image features into a 3D space. However, it sometimes assigns features from visible areas to occluded voxels, leading to ambiguities in the final 3D representation.\nSubsequent works have built on these foundations. VoxFormer\n[\n10\n]\npresents a sparse-to-dense framework that identifies visible voxels through depth estimation and propagates information to non-visible regions, ensuring accurate initial 3D representation. TPVFormer\n[\n8\n]\nintroduces a tri-perspective view representation to efficiently model fine-grained 3D structures using a transformer-based encoder. OccFormer\n[\n24\n]\nintroduces a dual-path transformer encoder to process 3D voxel features, capturing both fine-grained details and global semantic layouts.\nSymphonize\n[\n9\n]\nintegrates instance queries to enhance scene modeling using Serial Instance-Propagated Attentions.\nCGFormer\n[\n22\n]\nintroduces a Context and Geometry Aware Voxel Transformer that generates context-dependent queries. ET-Former\n[\n11\n]\nleverages a triplane-based deformable attention mechanism to improve semantic predictions while lowering training memory consumption.\nII-C\nDiffusion-Based Generative Model\nDiffusion models\n[\n7\n,\n17\n]\nhave achieved remarkable success in 2D image synthesis and are increasingly applied to 3D tasks. Several works adapted diffusion for point cloud generation\n[\n13\n]\nor 3D shape modeling\n[\n4\n]\n. Recently, consistency models\n[\n15\n]\nhave emerged as a family of one-step generative models that map noised data point directly to the clean data. While such models can be used as students for distillation or trained from scratch using consistency training\n[\n15\n,\n16\n]\n, they often enforce consistency among empirical samples, accumulating irreducible bias due to discretization errors.\nIn contrast, our work leverages Shortcut Models\n[\n6\n]\nwithin a flow-matching framework. Unlike consistency training, Shortcut Models learn to simulate a direct ”shortcut” along the probability flow ODE. This approach avoids the bias accumulation of consistency training and requires significantly fewer bootstraps, while bypassing the need for complex perceptual losses or strict schedules. By adapting this to the latent triplane space, we achieve high-fidelity 3D scene completion in a single inference step.\nIII\nMETHOD\nIn this section, we present FlowSSC, a universal generative framework for Semantic Scene Completion. The core of our method is a Shortcut Latent Diffusion model that operates in a compact triplane latent space compressed by a VecSet VAE. This design allows for high-fidelity 3D semantic scene generation with real-time inference capabilities.\nIII-A\nPreliminaries: Flow Matching and Shortcut Models\nFlow Matching\nGenerative modeling via Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs) defines a probability path\np\nt\n​\n(\n𝒙\n)\np_{t}(\\bm{x})\nthat smoothly transforms a simple prior distribution\np\n0\n​\n(\n𝒙\n)\np_{0}(\\bm{x})\n(e.g., standard Gaussian\n𝒩\n​\n(\n𝟎\n,\n𝑰\n)\n\\mathcal{N}(\\bm{0},\\bm{I})\n) to a complex data distribution\np\n1\n​\n(\n𝒙\n)\np_{1}(\\bm{x})\n(e.g., 3D scene latents). This transformation is governed by an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE):\nd\n​\n𝒙\nt\nd\n​\nt\n=\n𝒗\nt\n​\n(\n𝒙\nt\n)\n,\n𝒙\n0\n∼\np\n0\n​\n(\n𝒙\n)\n,\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\bm{x}_{t}}{\\mathrm{d}t}=\\bm{v}_{t}(\\bm{x}_{t}),\\quad\\bm{x}_{0}\\sim p_{0}(\\bm{x}),\n(1)\nwhere\n𝒗\nt\n​\n(\n⋅\n)\n\\bm{v}_{t}(\\cdot)\nis a time-dependent vector field that constructs the flow\nϕ\nt\n\\phi_{t}\n. The standard Flow Matching (FM) objective\n[\n12\n]\naims to regress a target vector field\n𝒖\nt\n\\bm{u}_{t}\nthat generates a desired probability path\np\nt\np_{t}\n:\nℒ\nFM\n​\n(\nθ\n)\n=\n𝔼\nt\n,\np\nt\n​\n(\n𝒙\n)\n​\n‖\n𝒗\nθ\n​\n(\n𝒙\n,\nt\n)\n−\n𝒖\nt\n​\n(\n𝒙\n)\n‖\n2\n.\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{FM}}(\\theta)=\\mathbb{E}_{t,p_{t}(\\bm{x})}\\|\\bm{v}_{\\theta}(\\bm{x},t)-\\bm{u}_{t}(\\bm{x})\\|^{2}.\n(2)\nShortcut Models\nStandard Flow Matching models learn the instantaneous velocity field (an ODE), which requires many small steps for accurate integration due to the curved probability paths. Naively taking large steps leads to significant discretization error. Shortcut Models\n[\n6\n]\naddress this by introducing a new conditioning variable: the step size\nd\nd\n. The model learns a\nshortcut function\ns\nθ\n​\n(\n𝒙\nt\n,\nt\n,\nd\n)\ns_{\\theta}(\\bm{x}_{t},t,d)\nrepresenting the\nnormalized direction\nfrom the current state\n𝒙\nt\n\\bm{x}_{t}\nto the next state\n𝒙\nt\n+\nd\n\\bm{x}_{t+d}\n:\n𝒙\nt\n+\nd\n=\n𝒙\nt\n+\nd\n⋅\ns\nθ\n​\n(\n𝒙\nt\n,\nt\n,\nd\n)\n.\n\\bm{x}_{t+d}=\\bm{x}_{t}+d\\cdot s_{\\theta}(\\bm{x}_{t},t,d).\n(3)\nBy conditioning on\nd\nd\n, the model accounts for the path’s future curvature, allowing it to ”jump” directly to the correct point rather than drifting off-track. The training leverages a Self-Consistency property: taking one shortcut step of size\n2\n​\nd\n2d\nshould be equivalent to taking two consecutive steps of size\nd\nd\n. Formally:\ns\n​\n(\n𝒙\nt\n,\nt\n,\n2\n​\nd\n)\n=\n1\n2\n​\ns\n​\n(\n𝒙\nt\n,\nt\n,\nd\n)\n+\n1\n2\n​\ns\n​\n(\n𝒙\nt\n+\nd\n′\n,\nt\n+\nd\n,\nd\n)\n,\ns(\\bm{x}_{t},t,2d)=\\frac{1}{2}s(\\bm{x}_{t},t,d)+\\frac{1}{2}s(\\bm{x}^{\\prime}_{t+d},t+d,d),\n(4)\nwhere\n𝒙\nt\n+\nd\n′\n\\bm{x}^{\\prime}_{t+d}\nis the intermediate state from the first step. This formulation allows the model to generalize flow matching: as\nd\n→\n0\nd\\to 0\n,\ns\nθ\ns_{\\theta}\nconverges to the instantaneous flow; for\nd\n=\n1\nd=1\n, it learns a direct one-step mapping. Thus, a single model can support flexible inference budgets, from 1-step generation to refined multi-step sampling.\nIII-B\nFlowSSC Framework\nAchieving high-fidelity 3D scene completion is particularly challenging for single-step generative models due to the high dimensionality of 3D data and severe occlusion. To address this, FlowSSC decomposes the task into three manageable stages, effectively combining the strengths of discriminative representation learning and generative refinement:\n1.\nLatent Compression via VecSet VAE.\nWe first establish a compact and efficient latent space. Instead of operating on sparse, high-dimensional voxels (\n256\n×\n256\n×\n32\n256\\times 256\\times 32\n), we train a\nVecSet VAE\n(Section\nIII-C\n) that compresses the scene into a dense Triplane representation\n𝒉\n\\bm{h}\n. This significantly reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained geometric details via Cross-Attention.\n2.\nCoarse Prediction Condition.\nTo provide a structural prior for generation, we predict an initial coarse voxel grid\n𝑿\nc\n​\no\n​\na\n​\nr\n​\ns\n​\ne\n\\bm{X}_{coarse}\nfrom the input image. We adopt established architectural paradigms from state-of-the-art feedforward methods, which typically employ a 2D backbone for feature extraction followed by a 2D-to-3D lifting module. This predicted\n𝑿\nc\n​\no\n​\na\n​\nr\n​\ns\n​\ne\n\\bm{X}_{coarse}\nserves as a strong condition\n𝒄\n\\bm{c}\n, capturing global semantic layout but potentially lacking detail in occluded regions.\n3.\nShortcut Latent Diffusion model.\nFinally, we perform generative refinement in the triplane latent space. We employ a Shortcut Latent Diffusion Model (Section\nIII-E\n) conditioned on\n𝒉\nc\n​\no\n​\na\n​\nr\n​\ns\n​\ne\n\\bm{h}_{coarse}\n. By learning a direct ”shortcut” mapping from noise to the clean distribution, our model can rectify geometric errors and hallucinate plausible details in occluded areas in as few as one single step, achieving real-time high-fidelity completion.\nIII-C\nLatent Space Compression via VecSet VAE\nTo enable efficient diffusion modeling, we compress the high-dimensional voxel grid into a compact triplane latent space. Unlike standard 3D-CNNs that process sparse data inefficiently, we adopt a VecSet-inspired architecture\n[\n23\n]\n, leveraging Cross-Attention to aggregate geometric information into a structured latent representation. This formulation treats the input as a set of tokens and learns a function approximator that maps spatial queries to occupancy probabilities.\nSet-to-Set Encoding Mechanism\nThe encoder processes the input voxel grid\n𝑿\n∈\n{\n0\n,\n1\n}\nH\n×\nW\n×\nD\n\\bm{X}\\in\\{0,1\\}^{H\\times W\\times D}\nas a sparse set of non-empty feature tokens. Specifically, we extract voxel coordinates and features (if available) to form the input set\n𝒱\n=\n{\n(\n𝐯\ni\n,\n𝐩\ni\n)\n}\ni\n=\n1\nN\n\\mathcal{V}=\\{(\\mathbf{v}_{i},\\mathbf{p}_{i})\\}_{i=1}^{N}\n, where\n𝐯\ni\n\\mathbf{v}_{i}\nrepresents the local geometry feature and\n𝐩\ni\n∈\nℝ\n3\n\\mathbf{p}_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}\ncorresponds to the normalized spatial coordinate.\nTo compress this set into a fixed-size representation, we introduce a set of\nTriplane Queries\n𝑸\n∈\nℝ\n(\nH\nt\n​\np\n​\nW\nt\n​\np\n+\n2\n​\nH\nt\n​\np\n​\nD\nt\n​\np\n)\n×\nC\n\\bm{Q}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{(H_{tp}W_{tp}+2H_{tp}D_{tp})\\times C}\n, which are initialized with 2D Fourier positional encodings corresponding to the projected planes (XY, XZ, YZ).\nWe employ Multi-Head Cross-Attention (MHCA) where\n𝑸\n\\bm{Q}\nserves as the queries, and the input set\n𝒱\n\\mathcal{V}\nacts as keys and values. The update rule for the query features is:\n𝒉\n=\nMHCA\n​\n(\n𝑸\n,\n𝒱\n)\n=\nSoftmax\n​\n(\n𝑸\n​\n(\n𝒱\nemb\n​\n𝑾\nK\n)\nT\nd\n)\n​\n(\n𝒱\nemb\n​\n𝑾\nV\n)\n,\n\\bm{h}=\\text{MHCA}(\\bm{Q},\\mathcal{V})=\\text{Softmax}\\left(\\frac{\\bm{Q}(\\mathcal{V}_{\\text{emb}}\\bm{W}_{K})^{T}}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right)(\\mathcal{V}_{\\text{emb}}\\bm{W}_{V}),\n(5)\nwhere\n𝒱\nemb\n\\mathcal{V}_{\\text{emb}}\ndenotes the position-augmented input tokens. Intuitively, each element in\n𝑸\n\\bm{Q}\nlearns to attend to and aggregate features from relevant spatial regions defined by the attention weights, effectively learning an implicit interpolation function. This ”probing” mechanism allows the model to capture fine-grained details regardless of the input sparsity pattern. To handle the quadratic complexity of attention, we utilize FlashAttention\n[\n5\n]\nfor efficient computation.\nThe resulting queries are reshaped into three orthogonal feature planes:\n𝒉\nx\n​\ny\n∈\nℝ\nH\nt\n​\np\n×\nW\nt\n​\np\n×\nC\n\\bm{h}_{xy}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{H_{tp}\\times W_{tp}\\times C}\n,\n𝒉\nx\n​\nz\n∈\nℝ\nH\nt\n​\np\n×\nD\nt\n​\np\n×\nC\n\\bm{h}_{xz}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{H_{tp}\\times D_{tp}\\times C}\n, and\n𝒉\ny\n​\nz\n∈\nℝ\nW\nt\n​\np\n×\nD\nt\n​\np\n×\nC\n\\bm{h}_{yz}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{W_{tp}\\times D_{tp}\\times C}\n. In our setting,\nH\nt\n​\np\n=\nW\nt\n​\np\n=\n128\nH_{tp}=W_{tp}=128\n,\nD\nt\n​\np\n=\n16\nD_{tp}=16\n, and\nC\n=\n64\nC=64\n, achieving a significant compression ratio while maintaining high fidelity (85.91% IoU) compared to baseline CNNs.\nDecoder\nThe decoder transforms the triplane latents back to the voxel space. For any query point\n𝐱\n∈\nℝ\n3\n\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}\nin the target grid, we project it onto each of the three feature planes to retrieve features via bilinear interpolation. These features are summed and passed through a lightweight MLP to predict the occupancy probability\nO\n^\n​\n(\n𝐱\n)\n\\hat{O}(\\mathbf{x})\n. To efficiently reconstruct the full\n256\n×\n256\n×\n32\n256\\times 256\\times 32\ngrid, we employ a shallow 3D-CNN decoder that upsamples the aggregated triplane features. During the subsequent diffusion training, this VAE is frozen, serving as a robust neural tokenizer.\nIII-D\nCoarse Prediction as Condition\nTo guide the generation process, we predict an initial coarse representation from the monocular image\n𝑰\n\\bm{I}\n. The prediction network\nF\np\n​\nr\n​\ne\n​\nd\nF_{pred}\nfollows a standard vision-centric SSC architecture. It starts with a 2D backbone extracting multi-scale visual features, which are then lifted into 3D space via a view projection module to establish geometric correspondence. These 3D features are processed by a 3D encoder-decoder to complete the scene geometry and hallucinate occluded regions. Finally, a Prediction Head produces a coarse semantic voxel grid. This coarse estimate serves as a structural prior and is encoded into the triplane latent space to obtain the condition\n𝑿\nc\n​\no\n​\na\n​\nr\n​\ns\n​\ne\n\\bm{X}_{coarse}\nfor the subsequent diffusion refinement.\nIII-E\nShortcut Latent Diffusion Model\nWe employ a Shortcut Latent Diffusion Model to refine the coarse condition\n𝒉\nc\n​\no\n​\na\n​\nr\n​\ns\n​\ne\n\\bm{h}_{coarse}\ninto high-fidelity triplanes. Here,\n𝒉\nc\n​\no\n​\na\n​\nr\n​\ns\n​\ne\n\\bm{h}_{coarse}\nis obtained by encoding the coarse prediction\n𝑿\nc\n​\no\n​\na\n​\nr\n​\ns\n​\ne\n\\bm{X}_{coarse}\nvia the pre-trained VecSet VAE encoder. Unlike standard diffusion models, our approach utilizes a Triplane Diffusion Transformer (DiT) and a Shortcut Model to enable flexible inference from one to many steps.\nTriplane DiT Architecture\nWe adopt a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) tailored for triplane representations. The input consists of the channel-wise concatenation of the noisy triplane\n𝒉\nt\n∈\nℝ\n3\n×\nH\n×\nW\n×\nC\n\\bm{h}_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3\\times H\\times W\\times C}\nand the coarse condition\n𝒉\nc\n​\no\n​\na\n​\nr\n​\ns\n​\ne\n\\bm{h}_{coarse}\n. These are patchified into a sequence of tokens, which are then processed by a series of Transformer blocks.\nA key modification for the Shortcut formulation is the conditioning mechanism. We employ Adaptive Layer Normalization (AdaLN) to inject both the current timestep\nt\nt\nand the step size\nd\nd\n. Specifically,\nt\nt\nand\nd\nd\nare independently mapped to high-dimensional embeddings using Fourier features and MLPs, then summed to form a unified conditioning vector. This vector regresses the scale and shift parameters\n𝜸\n​\n(\nt\n,\nd\n)\n,\n𝜷\n​\n(\nt\n,\nd\n)\n\\bm{\\gamma}(t,d),\\bm{\\beta}(t,d)\nfor the AdaLN layers:\nAdaLN\n​\n(\n𝒛\n,\nt\n,\nd\n)\n=\n𝜸\n​\n(\nt\n,\nd\n)\n⋅\nLayerNorm\n​\n(\n𝒛\n)\n+\n𝜷\n​\n(\nt\n,\nd\n)\n.\n\\text{AdaLN}(\\bm{z},t,d)=\\bm{\\gamma}(t,d)\\cdot\\text{LayerNorm}(\\bm{z})+\\bm{\\beta}(t,d).\n(6)\nThis design allows dimensions of the condition such as the denoising stride\nd\nd\nto globally modulate the feature statistics, enabling the network to dynamically adapt its computation for either fine-grained flow matching (\nd\n→\n0\nd\\to 0\n) or large shortcut jumps (\nd\n≫\n0\nd\\gg 0\n). Optimization is performed on the valid triplane regions, masking out empty corners in the composed representation.\nShortcut Flow Matching\nWe train the model with a unified objective that combines instantaneous flow matching and long-range self-consistency. The total loss\nℒ\n𝐒\n​\n(\nθ\n)\n\\mathcal{L}^{\\mathbf{S}}(\\theta)\nis defined as the expectation over data samples, timesteps, and step sizes\n[\n6\n]\n:\nℒ\n𝐒\n​\n(\nθ\n)\n=\n‖\ns\nθ\n​\n(\n𝒉\nt\n,\nt\n,\n0\n)\n−\n(\n𝒉\ng\n​\nt\n−\n𝒉\nn\n​\no\n​\ni\n​\ns\n​\ne\n)\n‖\n2\n⏟\nFlow-Matching\n+\n‖\ns\nθ\n​\n(\n𝒉\nt\n,\nt\n,\n2\n​\nd\n)\n−\ns\ntarget\n‖\n2\n⏟\nSelf-Consistency\n,\n\\begin{split}\\mathcal{L}^{\\mathbf{S}}(\\theta)=&\\underbrace{\\|s_{\\theta}(\\bm{h}_{t},t,0)-(\\bm{h}_{gt}-\\bm{h}_{noise})\\|^{2}}_{\\text{Flow-Matching}}\\\\\n&+\\underbrace{\\|s_{\\theta}(\\bm{h}_{t},t,2d)-s_{\\text{target}}\\|^{2}}_{\\text{Self-Consistency}},\\end{split}\n(7)\nwhere the self-consistency target is constructed by concatenating two smaller steps:\ns\ntarget\n=\n1\n2\n​\ns\nθ\n​\n(\n𝒉\nt\n,\nt\n,\nd\n)\n+\n1\n2\n​\ns\nθ\n​\n(\n𝒉\nt\n+\nd\n′\n,\nt\n+\nd\n,\nd\n)\ns_{\\text{target}}=\\frac{1}{2}s_{\\theta}(\\bm{h}_{t},t,d)+\\frac{1}{2}s_{\\theta}(\\bm{h}^{\\prime}_{t+d},t+d,d)\n.\nIntuitively, the Flow-Matching term grounds the model at small step sizes (\nd\n→\n0\nd\\to 0\n) to match the empirical velocity field, ensuring stable ODE integration. The Self-Consistency term propagates this generation capability from multi-step to few-step and ultimately to One-Step Generation, by enforcing that a large jump\n2\n​\nd\n2d\nis consistent with two sequential jumps of size\nd\nd\n.

We first describe the dataset and evaluation metrics used. Then, we present quantitative results comparing our method to state-of-the-art approaches and provide a detailed analysis. Finally, we include qualitative results and potentially ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of our key components.\nIV-A\nQuantitative Results\nWe quantitatively evaluate our method’s performance on the SemanticKITTI Semantic Scene Completion test set and compare it with current state-of-the-art methods. The results are presented in Table\nI\n.\nTable\nI\nlists the performance of our proposed method and several leading existing approaches on key metrics, including Semantic Mean IoU (mIoU), Geometric IoU, and per-class Semantic IoU for the 20 semantic categories.\nAs shown in Table\nI\n, our proposed method demonstrates superior performance on the SemanticKITTI test set, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Specifically, our method obtains a Semantic mIoU of 19.52% and a IoU of 56.97%. These results not only set a new benchmark but also represent a substantial leap over prior leading methods, highlighting the efficacy of our generative framework.\nAn analysis of the per-class performance provides further insights into the robustness of our model. Notably, our method achieves the highest IoU across all reported semantic categories, even on those that typically suffer from severe occlusion or sparse observations. This superiority is particularly evident in the ’road’ category, where our model achieves an impressive 41.63% IoU. For context, the next best performing method reaches only 26.74% on this challenging class, demonstrating an unprecedented capability in completing difficult structures. As illustrated in Fig.\n3\n, buildings (yellow) are frequently occluded by roadside vegetation in driving scenarios. Existing methods struggle to recover these structures, often resulting in empty regions or large artifacts. In contrast, FlowSSC effectively learns implicit ”outdoor layout rules” from the dataset distribution—for instance, that buildings typically reside behind vegetation layers—and successfully reconstructs the structural contours of these occluded buildings. This capability to infer environmental context despite severe occlusion is crucial for situational awareness in real-time applications.\nThis strong performance across a diverse range of categories indicates that our method is capable of accurately completing and segmenting various objects and structures within the 3D scene.\nIV-B\nAblation Studies\nWe conduct comprehensive ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of key components in our FlowSSC framework. All experiments are conducted on the SemanticKITTI validation set.\nEffect of Shortcut Latent Diffusion Refiner\nWe first investigate the contribution of our Shortcut Latent Diffusion refiner by comparing the performance with and without the refinement stage. Table\nII\nshows the results.\nTABLE II\n:\nAblation study on the effect of Shortcut Latent Diffusion refiner.\nMethod\nIoU (%)\nmIoU (%)\nCoarse Prediction Only\n15.86\n50.77\n+ Shortcut Diffusion Refiner\n19.51\n56.60\nImprovement\n+3.65\n+5.83\nAs shown in Table\nII\n, the Shortcut Latent Diffusion refiner provides a significant improvement over the coarse prediction baseline. This demonstrates that our generative refinement effectively corrects errors and synthesizes high-fidelity details in the latent triplane space.\nImpact of Inference Steps\nTABLE III\n:\nAblation study on the number of inference steps in Shortcut Model.\n# Steps\nIoU (%)\nmIoU (%)\nTime (ms)\n1\n56.98\n19.55\n66\n2\n56.63\n19.52\n131\n4\n56.15\n19.37\n261\n8\n55.68\n19.19\n518\n16\n55.54\n19.07\n1044\nWe evaluate the performance of FlowSSC with varying numbers of sampling steps, as shown in Table\nIII\n. Contrary to standard diffusion models where quality typically improves with more steps, our method achieves peak performance with a single step.\nThe results indicate that 1-step inference yields the highest IoU (56.98%) and mIoU (19.55%). This behavior stems from the unique property of the Shortcut learning objective. The Self-Consistency loss explicitly trains the model to learn a precise ”shortcut” mapping to the data distribution. At the current training stage (110k iterations), the model has effectively converged to an optimal direct trajectory. Increasing the number of steps introduces intermediate states that, while theoretically valid, may suffer from minor cumulative errors or trajectory drift compared to the directly optimized one-step path. This characteristic is highly advantageous for real-time applications, as it allows FlowSSC to deliver its best accuracy at maximum speed (66ms), eliminating the need for expensive multi-step refinement.\nComparison of VAE Architectures\nWe compare our VecSet VAE architecture (based on Cross-Attention) with a conventional Conv-based VAE. Both architectures compress 3D voxels into triplane latents, but differ in how they aggregate spatial information. Table\nIV\nshows the reconstruction quality on the validation set.\nTABLE IV\n:\nComparison of VAE architectures for triplane representation.\nVAE Architecture\nIoU (%)\nmIoU (%)\nConv-based VAE\n84.51\n77.66\nVecSet VAE (Ours)\n91.10\n85.89\nOur VecSet VAE, which leverages Cross-Attention to aggregate 3D voxel features into learnable triplane queries, achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to the Conv-based baseline. This improvement can be attributed to the ability of Cross-Attention to selectively aggregate relevant spatial information from the entire voxel grid, rather than relying on local convolutional receptive fields. The enhanced triplane representation also benefits the subsequent diffusion refinement stage.\nIV-C\nQualitative Results\nTo complement our quantitative evaluation, we present qualitative results on the SemanticKITTI test set in Figure\n3\n. These visualizations offer crucial insights into the practical capabilities of our method, particularly its ability to handle challenging real-world scenarios.\nAs illustrated in Figure\n3\n, our method demonstrates exceptional visual fidelity, producing 3D semantic scene completions that are remarkably close to the ground truth logic and geometry. Beyond strong quantitative metrics, the qualitative results highlight the method’s generative capability, particularly in challenging occluded regions.\nA critical observation is our model’s ability to infer complete structures from sparse visual cues. As highlighted in the red boxes, FlowSSC successfully ”hallucinates” the missing geometry and semantics in high-occlusion scenarios, such as visual blind spots at road curves, the continuity of roadside vegetation, and the spatial layout of buildings. Where traditional feedforward models often fail or output blurry predictions, our approach leverages the strong generative prior learned from large-scale data, effectively inferring plausible unseen parts consistent with the visible context. The single-step refiner plays a key role here, transforming coarse, ambiguous estimates into sharp, coherent structures.\nThis capability to predict the ”unknown” from limited cues is paramount for future autonomous systems. It ensures that downstream planning and safety modules operate on a complete and coherent world representation, rather than a fragmented one. Furthermore, this behavior underscores the scalable nature of our generative framework: as it absorbs more data, its internal world model becomes increasingly consistent and predictive, enabling it to handle complex, unseen scenarios with greater robustness.

In contrast, the DiT Refinement stage is remarkably efficient, requiring only 66 ms per scene. This efficiency stems from our use of the compressed triplane space and the single-step inference capability of the Shortcut Model.\nThe total inference time is 0.216 seconds per scene (approximately 4.6 FPS), enabling near real-time performance. regarding memory, the total GPU memory consumption is 30.52 GB. While substantial, this fits within the VRAM capacity of high-end consumer GPUs (e.g., RTX 5090) and professional workstations, making high-fidelity generative SSC accessible. We note that:\n•\nThe memory usage is a trade-off for the state-of-the-art accuracy achieved by our two-stage generative approach.\n•\nThe separate stages allow for pipelined optimization in future deployment scenarios.\n•\nFuture work will suggest model compression techniques (e.g., pruning, quantization) to further reduce memory requirements while maintaining accuracy.\nOverall Performance\nDespite the computational overhead of the multi-stage pipeline, the total inference speed of our FlowSSC framework remains comparable to other monocular SSC methods while achieving superior accuracy. This demonstrates that our design successfully balances performance and efficiency through the strategic use of compact triplane representation and single-step diffusion.\nV\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we introduced FlowSSC, a universal generative framework for monocular Semantic Scene Completion that reconciles high-fidelity generation with real-time efficiency. By compressing the 3D scene into a compact triplane latent space via our VecSet VAE and employing a teacher-free Shortcut Flow Matching training objective, our model learns a direct one-step mapping for generative refinement. This approach effectively addresses the inherent ill-posedness of the task, recovering fine-grained geometry and semantics from monocular input. Extensive experiments on the SemanticKITTI dataset demonstrate that FlowSSC establishes new state-of-the-art performance while maintaining practical inference speeds suitable for autonomous driving applications.\nDespite its strong performance, we identify several avenues for future improvement. First, while our shortcut training enables fast inference, the Flow Matching training process remains computationally intensive, and the Triplane Diffusion Transformer architecture demands significant GPU memory. Consequently, exploring techniques to reduce model complexity and designing memory-efficient architectures remains a priority to facilitate deployment on edge devices. Second, future research should investigate how Self-Consistency objectives influence training dynamics to accelerate convergence. Third, to fully exploit the generalization potential of our generative framework, scaling the training to larger, more diverse datasets is crucial. Finally, extending our efficient prediction paradigm to video inputs for improved temporal consistency is a key direction for future work.\nIn summary, FlowSSC presents a universal paradigm for generative 3D perception, demonstrating that semantic scene completion task can be significantly enhanced through our efficient one-step latent refinement. By synergizing the robust representational capacity of triplanes with the rapid inference of Shortcut Flow Matching, we pave the way for real-time, high-fidelity generative 3D scene understanding.\nReferences\n[1]\nJ.

    "preview_text": "Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) from monocular RGB images is a fundamental yet challenging task due to the inherent ambiguity of inferring occluded 3D geometry from a single view. While feed-forward methods have made progress, they often struggle to generate plausible details in occluded regions and preserve the fundamental spatial relationships of objects. Such accurate generative reasoning capability for the entire 3D space is critical in real-world applications. In this paper, we present FlowSSC, the first generative framework applied directly to monocular semantic scene completion. FlowSSC treats the SSC task as a conditional generation problem and can seamlessly integrate with existing feed-forward SSC methods to significantly boost their performance. To achieve real-time inference without compromising quality, we introduce Shortcut Flow-matching that operates in a compact triplane latent space. Unlike standard diffusion models that require hundreds of steps, our method utilizes a shortcut mechanism to achieve high-fidelity generation in a single step, enabling practical deployment in autonomous systems.

            "answer": "好的，作为一名专业的学术论文分析助手，我将对这篇题为《FlowSSC: Universal Generative Monocular Semantic Scene Completion via One-Step Latent Diffusion》的论文进行深入分析，并详细阐述其提出的关键技术方法。\n\n## 论文核心技术创新分析\n\nFlowSSC 的核心目标是解决单目语义场景补全任务中固有的“一对多”映射模糊性问题，同时克服传统扩散模型推理速度慢的瓶颈。其技术框架围绕 **“高效潜空间压缩”** 和 **“一步式生成式精炼”** 两大支柱构建。\n\n以下是其关键技术方法的详细说明：\n\n| 技术模块 | 核心目标 | 关键技术细节与数学原理 | 具体参数与实现 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **1. 潜空间压缩：VecSet VAE** | 将高维稀疏体素网格压缩为紧凑、高效的**三平面潜表示**，以降低后续扩散模型的复杂度。 | **a. 编码器（Set-to-Set Encoding）：** <br> - **输入：** 稀疏体素网格 `X ∈ {0,1}^{H×W×D}`，被视为一组非空特征令牌 `V = {(v_i, p_i)}`，其中 `v_i` 是特征，`p_i ∈ R^3` 是归一化坐标。<br> - **查询：** 引入一组可学习的**三平面查询** `Q ∈ R^{(H_tp*W_tp + 2*H_tp*D_tp)×C}`，用2D傅里叶位置编码初始化，对应XY, XZ, YZ三个正交平面。<br> - **注意力聚合：** 使用多头交叉注意力，以 `Q` 为查询，以输入集 `V` 为键和值，将3D几何信息聚合到查询中。公式为：<br> `h = MHCA(Q, V) = Softmax( Q (V_emb W_K)^T / √d ) (V_emb W_V)` <br> 其中 `V_emb` 是位置增强后的输入令牌。这使每个查询能隐式地关注并聚合相关空间区域的特征。<br> **b. 解码器：** <br> - 对于目标网格中的任意查询点 `x ∈ R^3`，将其投影到三个特征平面上，通过双线性插值检索特征 `f_xy, f_xz, f_yz`。<br> - 将三个特征求和后，通过一个轻量级MLP预测该点的占用概率 `Ô(x)`。 | - **输入体素分辨率：** `256 × 256 × 32` <br> - **三平面潜表示维度：** 每个平面为 `(H_tp, W_tp/D_tp, C)`，其中 `H_tp = W_tp = 128`, `D_tp = 16`, `C = 64`。<br> - **压缩比：** 从 `256*256*32 = 2,097,152` 个体素点，压缩到 `3 * 128 * 128 * 64 ≈ 3.1M` 个潜变量（未考虑通道和平面数差异的精确计算，但数量级大幅降低）。<br> - **重建性能：** 在验证集上达到 **85.89% mIoU**，证明其保真度。 |\n| **2. 生成式精炼：捷径潜扩散模型** | 在潜空间中，以**单步推理**的方式，将粗糙预测精炼为高保真度的完整场景表示。基于**流匹配**与**捷径模型**框架。 | **a. 理论基础（流匹配 & 捷径模型）：** <br> - **流匹配（FM）：** 定义概率路径 `p_t(x)`，通过ODE平滑地将先验分布 `p_0`（高斯噪声）转换为数据分布 `p_1`：`dx_t/dt = v_t(x_t)`。FM目标是最小化预测向量场 `v_θ` 与目标向量场 `u_t` 的差异：`L_FM(θ) = E_{t,p_t(x)} [‖ v_θ(x,t) - u_t(x) ‖^2]`。<br> - **捷径模型（Shortcut Models）：** 为解决标准FM需要多步积分的问题，引入**步长 `d`** 作为条件变量。模型学习一个**捷径函数 `s_θ(x_t, t, d)`**，表示从当前状态 `x_t` 到下一状态 `x_{t+d}` 的**归一化方向**：`x_{t+d} = x_t + d · s_θ(x_t, t, d)`。<br> - **自一致性目标：** 核心约束是，一个大小为 `2d` 的捷径步应与两个连续的 `d` 步等价：<br> `s(x_t, t, 2d) = (1/2)s(x_t, t, d) + (1/2)s(x'_{t+d}, t+d, d)` <br> 其中 `x'_{t+d}` 是第一步后的中间状态。这使得模型能学习从单步 (`d=1`) 到多步 (`d→0`) 的灵活推理。 <br><br> **b. 模型架构（三平面扩散Transformer - Triplane DiT）：** <br> - **输入：** 噪声三平面 `h_t` 与粗糙条件 `h_coarse` 的通道拼接。<br> - **条件注入：** 使用**自适应层归一化（AdaLN）** 同时注入时间步 `t` 和步长 `d`：<br> `AdaLN(z, t, d) = γ(t,d) · LayerNorm(z) + β(t,d)` <br> `γ, β` 由 `t` 和 `d` 的嵌入求和后经MLP回归得到。这使得网络能动态适应不同步长下的计算模式。<br><br> **c. 训练目标：** <br> 结合流匹配损失和自一致性损失的统一目标：<br> ``` <br> L^S(θ) = ‖ s_θ(h_t, t, 0) - (h_gt - h_noise) ‖^2  // 流匹配项 (d→0) <br>        + ‖ s_θ(h_t, t, 2d) - s_target ‖^2         // 自一致性项 <br> ``` <br> 其中 `s_target = (1/2)s_θ(h_t, t, d) + (1/2)s_θ(h'_{t+d}, t+d, d)`。 | - **推理步数：** **主要使用1步**。消融实验表明，1步推理性能最佳（IoU 56.98%），多于1步反而因累积误差导致性能微降。<br> - **训练策略：** 每个mini-batch中，25%的样本计算自一致性损失（随机采样 `d ∈ [δ, 1-t]`），75%计算标准流匹配损失（`d=0`）。<br> - **条件：** 粗糙预测 `X_coarse` 由现有前馈SSC方法（如MonoScene范式）生成，并编码为三平面 `h_coarse`。<br> - **优化：** 使用AdamW，余弦退火学习率调度，初始学习率 `1e-4`。 |\n| **3. 整体流程与协同** | 将判别式模型的结构先验与生成式模型的细节 hallucination 能力相结合，实现通用、高效的性能提升。 | **三阶段流水线：** <br> 1. **粗糙预测：** 任何现有单目SSC方法生成粗糙体素 `X_coarse`，提供全局语义布局和几何先验。<br> 2. **潜编码：** 使用预训练且冻结的 **VecSet VAE 编码器**，将 `X_coarse` 压缩为条件三平面潜码 `h_coarse`。<br> 3. **生成式精炼：** **捷径潜扩散模型** 以 `h_coarse` 为条件，从高斯噪声 `h_0` 出发，通过**单步捷径函数** `s_θ(h_0, t=0, d=1)`，直接生成高质量的三平面潜码 `h_refined`。<br> 4. **解码输出：** 使用 **VecSet VAE 解码器** 将 `h_refined` 上采样回最终的高分辨率语义体素网格。 | - **性能提升：** 在SemanticKITTI上，精炼阶段将IoU从50.77%提升至56.60%，mIoU从15.86%提升至19.51%。<br> - **速度：** 总推理时间 ~216ms (4.6 FPS)。其中，DiT精炼仅需66ms，大部分时间消耗在VAE解码（150ms）。<br> - **内存：** 总GPU内存消耗约31.56 GB。 |\n\n## 总结：技术创新的实际价值\n\n1",
