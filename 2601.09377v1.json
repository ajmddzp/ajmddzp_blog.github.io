Existing trajectory planners exhibit systematic failures in these scenarios due to data imbalance. This results in insufficient modelling of vehicle dynamics, road geometry, and environmental constraints in high-risk situations, leading to suboptimal or unsafe trajectory prediction when vehicles operate near their physical limits.\nIn this paper, we introduce\nReflexDiffusion\n, a novel inference-stage framework that enhances diffusion-based trajectory planners through reflective adjustment. Our method introduces a gradient-based adjustment mechanism during the iterative denoising process: after each standard trajectory update, we compute the gradient between the conditional and unconditional noise predictions to explicitly amplify critical conditioning signals, including road curvature and lateral vehicle dynamics. This amplification enforces strict adherence to physical constraints, particularly improving stability during high-lateral-acceleration maneuvers where precise vehicle-road interaction is paramount. Evaluated on the nuPlan Test14-hard benchmark, ReflexDiffusion achieves a 14.1% improvement in driving score for high-lateral-acceleration scenarios over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. This demonstrates that inference-time trajectory optimization can effectively compensate for training data sparsity by dynamically reinforcing safety-critical constraints near handling limits. The framework’s architecture-agnostic design enables direct deployment to existing diffusion-based planners, offering a practical solution for improving autonomous vehicle safety in challenging driving conditions.\nCode\n—\nhttps://github.com/Luminous2028/ReflexDiffusion.git\n1\nIntroduction\nSafe autonomous driving fundamentally depends on generating reliable trajectories in long-tail scenarios. High-lateral-acceleration maneuvers presenting a critical paradox: they exhibit the highest accident risk yet receive the lowest representation in training data\n(Choudhari and Maji\n2021\n; Antonios\net al.\n2023\n; Rafiei\net al.\n2024\n; Kota\net al.\n2025\n; Sun\net al.\n2025\n)\n. While recent advances have focused on generating synthetic edge cases to augment training datasets\n(Tang\net al.\n2025\n; Xu\net al.\n2025\n; Peng\net al.\n2025\n)\n, a crucial gap remains in fully leveraging existing data to improve planning quality during inference. Current trajectory planning approaches fall into two categories: rule-based methods employ manually designed constraints\n(Dauner\net al.\n2023\n; Treiber\net al.\n2000\n)\nbut fail to adapt to novel scenarios; learning-based approaches that utilize imitation\n(Cheng\net al.\n2024a\n,\nb\n)\nor reinforcement learning\n(Liu\net al.\n2022\n,\n2023b\n)\nstruggle to capture the multi-modal nature of real-world driving, often resulting in suboptimal planning policies.\nDiffusion models have emerged as a promising solution for trajectory planning. For instance, the Diffusion Planner\n(Zheng\net al.\n2025\n)\njointly models agent dynamics, lane topology, and navigation information using a transformer architecture. However, these approaches exhibit critical limitations in\nhigh-lateral-acceleration scenarios\n, where they often generate unsafe trajectories due to curvature-speed decoupling. Furthermore, they typically rely on carefully designed classifier guidance functions. These functions must be continuously differentiable while satisfying multiple constraints-such as passenger comfort and collision avoidance, significantly complicating deployment.\nThe field of large language models offers a compelling paradigm through iterative reflection mechanisms. In this approach, generate-evaluate-refine cycles dramatically enhance output quality for high-stakes tasks that require complex constraint satisfaction\n(Ji\net al.\n2023\n; Shinn\net al.\n2023\n; Madaan\net al.\n2023\n; Gou\net al.\n2024\n)\n.\nThis paradigm holds significant promise for high-lateral-acceleration trajectory planning, where vehicles must operate near their physical limits while maintaining strict adherence to centripetal force constraints. Although reflection-based approaches have shown success across numerous domains\n(Liu\net al.\n2023a\n; Bai\net al.\n2025\n)\n, their application to trajectory planning remains unexplored. This gap presents an untapped opportunity to enhance safety when vehicles operate near their handling limits.\nIn this paper, we present ReflexDiffusion, a physics-aware reflection framework that pioneers a new approach for trajectory generation in autonomous driving. ReflexDiffusion operates through a dual-phase inference process: standard denoising generates an initial trajectory, which is then refined by a novel reflection phase that injects physics-aware gradients to explicitly enforce curvature-speed-acceleration coupling. This is achieved through conditional gradient ascent that amplifies critical physical constraints, iteratively refining the trajectory until convergence. Specifically, at each denoising step, we compute the gradient difference between conditional and unconditional noise predictions. This operation reveals how physical constraints influence trajectory generation. By strategically amplifying and injecting these gradients, we compel the trajectory to strictly adhere to centripetal force limitations, preventing dangerous speed-curvature violations that plague existing methods. Crucially, this approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted classifier guidance while maintaining full compatibility with existing diffusion-based planners, requiring no structural modifications. Thus, ReflexDiffusion fundamentally transforms the planning paradigm: rather than treating physical constraints as external penalties, it embeds them into the generative process through gradient-based reflection, enabling robust safety-critical planning tasks.\nWe demonstrate that ReflexDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on high-lateral-acceleration scenarios in the nuPlan Test14-hard\n(Cheng\net al.\n2024b\n)\nand Test14-random\n(Cheng\net al.\n2024b\n)\nbenchmarks. The method excels in safety-critical edge cases such as U-turns, where curvature-speed coupling is paramount. Our main contributions are as follows:\n•\nPioneering physics-aware reflection for trajectory generation.\nWe introduce the first adaptation of the reflection mechanism to autonomous driving trajectory planning. Our framework leverages gradient-based adjustment to perform iterative trajectory correction during diffusion sampling, thereby addressing critical safety gaps in real-time planning.\n•\nBreakthrough performance in high-lateral-acceleration scenarios.\nBy explicitly amplifying curvature-speed coupling through physics-aware reflection, ReflexDiffusion achieves a\n14.1% improvement\nin driving score on high-lateral-acceleration scenarios within the Test14-hard benchmark, setting a new state-of-the-art.\n•\nArchitecture-agnostic generalization.\nAs a plug-and-play module, the framework boosts the driving score of the Diffusion-es planner by\n22.5%\non Test14-hard when deployed during inference, demonstrating compelling universality and transferability without any architectural modifications.\n2\nRelated Works\nAutonomous vehicles trajectory generation.\nTrajectory generation for autonomous vehicles is primarily addressed by rule-based and learning-based methods. Rule-based approaches use explicit logical rules derived from traffic and safety knowledge\n(Treiber\net al.\n2000\n; Dauner\net al.\n2023\n)\n, but lack generalization in complex scenarios. Learning-based methods, such as imitation learning\n(Cheng\net al.\n2024a\n)\nand reinforcement learning\n(Shalev-Shwartz\net al.\n2016\n; Liu\net al.\n2023b\n)\n, learn policies from data but often produce suboptimal, unimodal trajectories. Diffusion models address this by capturing multi-modal behavior, however, they frequently depend on post-processing or guidance functions\n(Yang\net al.\n2024\n; Zheng\net al.\n2025\n)\n, which compromises their flexibility and interpretability. Our framework overcomes these limitations by eliminating the need for explicit guidance or rule-based refinement, instead enabling direct and flexible trajectory adaptation through a novel diffusion reflection mechanism.\nChallenges in long-tail scenarios.\nLong-tail scenarios involving high lateral acceleration (e.g., emergency curve negotiation) pose significant challenges to existing planners. These challenges stem from data scarcity, the oversimplified constraints of rule-based methods, and the static risk adaptation in imitation learning\n(Becker\net al.\n2023\n; Yoshioka and Suzuki\n2025\n)\n. Existing approaches often fail to incorporate key physical principles, such as curvature-speed-acceleration coupling (\na\ny\n=\nκ\n​\nv\n2\na_{y}=\\kappa v^{2}\n), resulting in unstable vehicle behavior near handling limits. Our method bridges this gap by leveraging inference-time reflection to dynamically reinforce\nκ\n\\kappa\n-\nv\nv\nrelationship and adjust safety margins using real-time lateral acceleration feedback.\nReflection mechanisms.\nReflection mechanisms iteratively refine outputs through generate-evaluate-adjust cycles, improving correctness and safety in domains such as large language models and computer vision\n(Liu\net al.\n2023a\n; Madaan\net al.\n2023\n; Bai\net al.\n2025\n)\n. However, they remain underexplored in trajectory planning, especially for high-dynamic scenarios. Existing adaptations in this domain are either computationally prohibitive for real-time use or fail to guarantee adherence to physical constraints\n(Yang\net al.\n2024\n; Zheng\net al.\n2025\n)\n. Our work introduces a real-time reflection mechanism that employs physics-compliant gradient adjustment and safety-gated triggers to proactively correct trajectories upon detecting curvature-speed misalignment.\nGeneralization of trajectory generation methods.\nGeneralization under distribution shift remains a persistent challenge. Rule-based methods typically require manual re-engineering per scenario, while data-driven generative models, such as GANs\n(Jiang\net al.\n2023\n)\nand the Diffusion Planner\n(Zheng\net al.\n2025\n)\n, often lack inference-time adaptability. In contrast, our reflection framework is architecture-agnostic. This design enables zero-shot transfer to unseen planners and delivers improved performance on nuPlan, without any structural modifications to the base model.\n3\nProblem Formulation\nTask Definition.\nHigh-lateral-acceleration scenarios represent a critical subset of long-tail driving situations characterized by extreme vehicle dynamics near handling limits.

(a) Training Module enhances model robustness to physically-coupled features via a conditional dropout strategy. (b) Denoising Module employs classifier-free guidance to generate initial trajectories. (c) Reflection Module iteratively refines trajectories by injecting physics-aware gradients to enforce curvature-speed-acceleration coupling constraints during inference. (d) Trajectory Confidence Module assesses trajectory reliability, and dynamically triggers the reflection mechanism to ensure safety.\n4.1\nTraining Module\nTo address data scarcity in long-tail scenarios, we introduce a conditional dropout strategy\n(Ho and Salimans\n2022\n)\ninto the Diffusion Planner\n(Zheng\net al.\n2025\n)\ntraining framework. While preserving its unified modeling capacity for neighbor vehicles, lane structures, and navigation signals, our approach strategically drops critical physics-coupled features during training to simulate real-world sensory degradation. Crucially, this includes randomly masking road turning radius\nR\nR\nand vehicle speed\nv\nv\nto simulate scenarios where their coupling\na\ny\n=\nv\n2\n/\nR\na_{y}=v^{2}/R\nis obscured. This forces the model to learn robust representations under partial observability, directly addressing the physics-disalignment challenge in extreme maneuvers.\nGiven a training sample with (1)\n𝐱\ng\n​\nt\n\\mathbf{x}_{gt}\n: Ground-truth trajectory; (2)\n𝐜\nf\n​\nu\n​\nl\n​\nl\n=\n[\n𝐜\nn\n​\ne\n​\ni\n​\ng\n​\nh\n​\nb\n​\no\n​\nr\n​\ns\n,\n𝐜\nl\n​\na\n​\nn\n​\ne\n​\ns\n,\n𝐜\nn\n​\na\n​\nv\n,\n𝐜\ns\n​\nt\n​\na\n​\nt\n​\ni\n​\nc\n​\n_\n​\no\n​\nb\n​\nj\n]\n\\mathbf{c}_{full}=[\\mathbf{c}_{{neighbors}},\\mathbf{c}_{{lanes}},\\mathbf{c}_{{nav}},\\mathbf{c}_{{static\\_obj}}]\n: Condition vector (neighbor vehicle data, lanes, navigation information, static objects); (3)\n𝐜\nd\n​\ne\n​\nc\n​\no\n​\nu\n​\np\n​\nl\n​\ne\n=\n[\n𝐜\nn\n​\na\n​\nv\n]\n\\mathbf{c}_{decouple}=[\\mathbf{c}_{nav}]\n, which drops lane information such as road turning radius\nR\nR\nand agent data including ego vehicle speed\nv\nv\n.\nWe generate masked condition\n𝐜\n~\n\\tilde{\\mathbf{c}}\nvia 10% conditional dropout:\n𝐜\n~\n=\n{\n𝐜\nd\n​\ne\n​\nc\n​\no\n​\nu\n​\np\n​\nl\n​\ne\nwith probability\n​\np\ndrop\n𝐜\nf\n​\nu\n​\nl\n​\nl\notherwise\n\\tilde{\\mathbf{c}}=\\begin{cases}\\mathbf{c}_{decouple}&\\text{with probability }p_{\\text{drop}}\\\\\n\\mathbf{c}_{full}&\\text{otherwise}\\end{cases}\n(2)\nThe diffusion training objective then becomes:\nℒ\nθ\n=\n𝔼\nt\n∼\n𝒰\n​\n(\n0\n,\nT\n)\n,\n𝐱\nt\n∼\nq\nt\n0\n​\n(\nx\nt\n|\nx\ng\n​\nt\n,\n𝐜\n~\n)\n​\n[\n‖\n𝐱\ng\n​\nt\n−\n𝐱\nt\n‖\n2\n]\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\theta}=\\mathbb{E}_{t\\sim\\mathcal{U}(0,T),\\mathbf{x}_{t}\\sim q_{t_{0}}(\\textbf{x}_{t}\\ |\\textbf{x}_{gt},\\tilde{\\mathbf{c}})}\\left[\\|\\mathbf{x}_{gt}-\\mathbf{x}_{t}\\|^{2}\\right]\n(3)\nwhile the diffusion training objective in Diffusion Planner is:\nℒ\nθ\n=\n𝔼\nt\n∼\n𝒰\n​\n(\n0\n,\nT\n)\n,\n𝐱\nt\n∼\nq\nt\n0\n​\n(\nx\nt\n|\nx\ng\n​\nt\n,\n𝐜\nf\n​\nu\n​\nl\n​\nl\n)\n∥\n𝐱\ng\n​\nt\n−\n𝐱\nt\n)\n∥\n2\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\theta}=\\mathbb{E}_{t\\sim\\mathcal{U}(0,T),\\mathbf{x}_{t}\\sim q_{t_{0}}(\\textbf{x}_{t}\\ |\\textbf{x}_{gt},\\mathbf{c}_{{full}})}\\|\\mathbf{x}_{gt}-\\mathbf{x}_{t})\\|^{2}\n(4)\n4.2\nDenoising Module\nTo address trajectory quality degradation in long-tail scenarios, particularly the inability to handle non-differentiable safety constraints, existing SOTA Diffusion Planners\n(Zheng\net al.\n2025\n)\nrely on complex classifier guidance (CG) during denoising. This approach requires handcrafting a guidance function\nf\ncg\n​\n(\nτ\n)\nf_{\\text{cg}}(\\tau)\nthat must be\ncontinuously differentiable, multi-objective and computationally tractable.\nHowever, these requirements lead to oversimplified approximations, severely limiting performance in safety-critical edge cases. Therefore, we utilize classifier-free guidance (CFG)\n(Ho and Salimans\n2022\n)\nas a principled alternative. The key innovation lies in embedding trajectory curvature constraint awareness directly into the diffusion model through conditional dropout during training, eliminating the need for auxiliary guidance functions.

This paradigm shift addresses inadequate long-tail information utilization in standard diffusion denoising, where single-pass sampling fails to recover critical scene semantics in rare events. Conventional denoising suffers from (1) Information dilution: Progressive noise removal attenuates long-tail features. (2) Error accumulation: Early-stage deviations amplify in later steps. (3) No recourse: Once generated, low-quality trajectories cannot be revised.\nOur physics-aware reflection mechanism breaks this linear flow through iterative information boosting.

To ensure that the performance gains are solely attributed to our proposed reflection mechanism and not training strategies, we retrain the current SOTA baseline Diffusion Planner, under two additional settings: Conditional dropout and Classifier-free guidance (CFG) for a comprehensive and fair comparison. Our method achieves SOTA on Test14-hard high-lateral-acceleration scenarios. NR: non-reactive mode. R: reactive mode.\nCompared to prior works, our reflection mechanism provides distinct advantages. Unlike classifier guidance (CG) or classifier-free guidance (CFG) methods that rely on one-shot generation, limiting their capacity for error correction, our approach enables iterative refinement through cyclic noise reversion. Whereas RL-based planners require costly retraining to adapt to new scenarios, our solution operates purely during inference without parameter updates. While ensemble methods achieve robustness via multiple models at the expense of high computational overhead, our method maintains efficiency by utilizing a single model architecture with minimal latency increase.\n4.4\nTrajectory Confidence Module\nTo assess the reliability of generated trajectories throughout the denoising and reflection cycles, we introduce a multi-factor confidence metric. This module fulfills two key roles: (1) determining when to trigger reflection, and (2) ensuring safety through real-time risk evaluation to enable effective fallback mechanisms.\nThe confidence metric\n𝒞\n​\n(\n𝐱\nt\n)\n\\mathcal{C}(\\mathbf{x}_{t})\nquantifies the reliability of generated trajectories in high-lateral-acceleration scenarios, integrating three domain-specific factors:\n1.

Both benchmarks are developed to cover the 14 scenario types including our target scenarios in the nuPlan Challenge, with the former introduced especially to represent long-tail scenarios.\nBaselines.\nThe baselines are mainly divided into three groups\n(Dauner\net al.\n2023\n)\n: Rule-based\n(Treiber\net al.\n2000\n; Dauner\net al.\n2023\n)\n, Learning-based\n(Scheel\net al.\n2021\n; Yang\net al.\n2024\n; Renz\net al.\n2022\n; Cheng\net al.\n2024b\n,\na\n; Zheng\net al.\n2025\n)\n, and Hybrid methods\n(Dauner\net al.\n2023\n; Huang\net al.\n2023\n; Fan\net al.\n2025\n)\n, which incorporate additional refinement to the outputs of the learning-based model. We compare ReflexDiffusion against\nthe baselines above, which are detailed in Appendix.\n(a)\nDiffusion Planner\n(b)\nReflexDiffusion\nFigure 2:\nVisualization comparison in U-turn scenario from high-lateral-acceleration scenarios. The Diffusion Planner’s trajectory veers out of the lane during the turn, while ReflexDiffusion makes the turn without incident!\n5.2\nMain Results\nWe compare the performance of ReflexDiffusion with baselines on high-lateral-acceleration scenarios in the long-tail dataset Test14-hard, as well as the regular dataset Test14-random.\nThe quantitative and qualitative results are shown in Table\n1\nto Table\n6\nand Figure\n2\nto Figure\n3\n, from which we derive the following findings.\nOur method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on high-lateral-acceleration scenarios in long-tail benchmarks while maintaining strong performance on regular datasets.\nAs summarized in Table\n1\n, ReflexDiffusion outperforms the current SOTA Diffusion Planner on the Test14-hard benchmark in both non-reactive and reactive modes, achieving a significant 14.1% improvement in driving score for the reactive mode. Concurrently, performance on the regular dataset is also substantially enhanced, with a 20.7% improvement in the non-reactive mode. Runtime analysis conducted on a single RTX 4090 GPU (Table\n2\n) indicates that enabling the reflection mechanism increases the per-step latency from 3.3 ms to 6.3 ms. However, since reflection is triggered in only\n≤\n\\leq\n0.5% of evaluated real-world driving cases, the average runtime is calculated as\n0.5\n%\n×\n122.7\n+\n99.5\n%\n×\n35.7\n≈\n36.1\n0.5\\%\\times 122.7+99.5\\%\\times 35.7\\approx 36.1\nms. This remains comparable to the SOTA baseline, sustaining a control frequency of\n>\n>\n20 Hz suitable for real-time deployment. Crucially, this marginal increase in latency is traded for a substantial gain in planning robustness and safety.\nPlanner\nper-step\ne2e\nDiffusion-es\n/\n7612.7\nDiffusion Planner\n/\n35.7\nReflexDiffusion w/o reflection\n3.3\n35.7\nOurs\n6.3\n36.1\nTable 2:\nRuntime tests among diffusion-based planners. The runtime of ReflexDiffusion stays near the current SOTA baseline, and trades minor latency for higher robustness.\nThe effectiveness of our method is further demonstrated through trajectory confidence.\nThe superior performance of ReflexDiffusion in high-lateral-acceleration scenarios is corroborated by trajectory confidence analysis. In a representative U-turn scenario where the baseline Diffusion Planner fails, our method achieves a significantly higher driving score (Table\n3\n). A qualitative comparison in Figure\n2\nillustrates this improvement: while the baseline planner generates trajectories that violate drivable areas due to excessive lateral acceleration, ReflexDiffusion produces trajectories that maintain both safety and feasibility.\nWe attribute the baseline’s failures to an insufficient representation of extreme vehicle dynamics in the training data, which critically impairs generalization to high-lateral-acceleration cases. To address this, ReflexDiffusion introduces a reflective adjustment step during inference. After each denoising iteration, a physics-aware gradient—derived from the difference between conditional and unconditional predictions—is computed and injected to explicitly amplify critical physical constraints. Through this iterative refinement, trajectories progressively converge to satisfy the centripetal force constraint\na\ny\n≤\nv\n2\n/\nR\na_{y}\\leq v^{2}/R\n. As visualized in the confidence plot (Figure\n3\n), the trajectory confidence temporarily decreases during the reflection phase due to exploratory gradient adjustments. This dip signifies an active optimization process against physical constraints. The confidence subsequently recovers and rises to a peak level after the final denoising step. This pattern demonstrates how the reflection mechanism compensates for training data scarcity by dynamically reinforcing vehicle-road interaction physics near handling limits, effectively converting transient uncertainty into enhanced safety margins.\nFigure 3:\nVisualization of trajectory confidence in inference process.\nrepresents the trend of trajectory confidence for ReflexDiffusion and\nrepresents the trend of trajectory confidence for Diffusion Planner.\nPlanner\nScore\nTrajectory Confidence\nnor\nre\nre-de\nDiffusion Planner\n0.00\n0.48\n/\n/\nOurs\n100.00\n0.87\n0.36\n0.73\nTable 3:\nDriving score comparisons on U-turn scenario from high-lateral-acceleration scenarios.

Its core innovation lies in an inference-stage reflection mechanism, with the only training modification being a random dropout of input features. This design enables seamless transfer across different diffusion-based planners. Generalization tests on both Diffusion Planner\n(Zheng\net al.\n2025\n)\nand Diffusion-es\n(Yang\net al.\n2024\n)\nconfirm its effectiveness, demonstrating significant performance improvements in long-tail scenarios as shown in Table\n4\nand Table\n5\n. We train the Diffusion-es conditional diffusion model for\n50 epochs\nas a baseline, and use the same settings to train a new model with a conditional dropout rate of 10%. These results validate ReflexDiffusion as a general and practical strategy for enhancing the safety and robustness of existing trajectory planners.\nPlanner\nTest14-hard\ndriving score\nTest14-random\ndriving score\nDiffusion Planner\n57.41\n71.60\nw/ ReflexDiffusion\n65.53\n86.40\nTable 4:\nGeneralizability test on Diffusion Planner.

The results show that the conditional dropout is significant and the optimal performance is achieved at 10%.\nDesign Choices for inference.\nWe ablate the classifier-free guidance denoising and reflection mechanism, as shown in Table\n6\n, as well as two hyperparameters: denoising scale\nλ\n1\n\\lambda_{1}\nand reflection scale\nλ\n2\n\\lambda_{2}\nshown in Figure\n4\n(b) and\n4\n(c), respectively.

    "preview_text": "Generating safe and reliable trajectories for autonomous vehicles in long-tail scenarios remains a significant challenge, particularly for high-lateral-acceleration maneuvers such as sharp turns, which represent critical safety situations. Existing trajectory planners exhibit systematic failures in these scenarios due to data imbalance. This results in insufficient modelling of vehicle dynamics, road geometry, and environmental constraints in high-risk situations, leading to suboptimal or unsafe trajectory prediction when vehicles operate near their physical limits. In this paper, we introduce ReflexDiffusion, a novel inference-stage framework that enhances diffusion-based trajectory planners through reflective adjustment. Our method introduces a gradient-based adjustment mechanism during the iterative denoising process: after each standard trajectory update, we compute the gradient between the conditional and unconditional noise predictions to explicitly amplify critical conditioning signals, including road curvature and lateral vehicle dynamics. This amplification enforces strict adherence to physical constraints, particularly improving stability during high-lateral-acceleration maneuvers where precise vehicle-road interaction is paramount. Evaluated on the nuPlan Test14-hard benchmark, ReflexDiffusion achieves a 14.1% improvement in driving score for high-lateral-acceleration scenarios over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. This demonstrates that inference-time trajectory optimization can effectively compensate for training data sparsity by dynamically reinforcing safety-critical constraints near handling limits. The framework's architecture-agnostic design enables direct deployment to existing diffusion-based planners, offering a practical solution for improving autonomous vehicle safety in challenging driving conditions.\n\nReflexDiffusion: Reflection-Enhanced Trajectory Planning for High-lateral-acceleration Scenarios in Autonomous Driving\nXuemei Yao\n1\n, Xiao",

            "answer": "## ReflexDiffusion 研究脉络与发展方向分析\n\n基于论文内容及其引用的相关文献，可以梳理出自动驾驶轨迹规划，特别是针对**高横向加速度（High-lateral-acceleration）长尾场景**这一方向的发展脉络。其演进主要围绕**如何更好地建模物理约束、处理数据稀疏性以及提升推理时规划质量**这几个核心挑战展开。发展路径可归纳为以下几个阶段和方向：\n\n### 发展脉络梳理\n\n#### 1. 传统规则化方法 (Rule-based Methods)\n- **代表工作**：IDM、PDM-Closed 等（Treiber et al., 2000; Dauner et al., 2023）。\n- **核心思想**：基于交通规则和车辆动力学知识，设计显式的逻辑规则和约束来生成轨迹。\n- **改进与局限**：\n    - **优点**：可解释性强，在常见场景下稳定。\n    - **缺点**：缺乏泛化能力，无法适应复杂、新颖的长尾场景（如紧急弯道），需要针对新场景手动重新设计规则，灵活性差。\n\n#### 2. 数据驱动的学习化方法 (Learning-based Methods)\n为了克服规则方法的泛化问题，研究转向从数据中学习策略。\n- **a. 模仿学习 (Imitation Learning)**：\n    - **代表工作**：UrbanDriver, Pluto（Cheng et al., 2024a,b）。\n    - **核心思想**：从人类驾驶数据中学习驾驶策略，直接模仿专家行为。\n    - **改进**：相比规则方法，能更好地处理多模态的驾驶行为，适应更复杂的场景。\n    - **局限**：\n        - **数据偏差**：严重依赖训练数据分布，对高横向加速度等长尾场景数据覆盖不足，导致规划失败。\n        - **静态风险适应**：难以动态调整安全边界，在极限工况下可能产生次优或不安全轨迹。\n- **b. 强化学习 (Reinforcement Learning)**：\n    - **代表工作**：（Liu et al., 2022, 2023b）。\n    - **核心思想**：通过与仿真环境交互，以奖励函数驱动，学习最优的规划策略。\n    - **改进**：能够优化长期收益，理论上可以探索出超越人类专家的策略。\n    - **局限**：\n        - **奖励函数设计难**：需要精心设计兼顾安全、舒适、效率的奖励函数。\n        - **训练成本高**：需要大量交互数据，且泛化到新场景可能需要重新训练。\n        - **安全性保障难**：在探索过程中可能产生危险行为。\n\n#### 3. 生成模型与扩散模型 (Generative & Diffusion Models)\n为了捕捉驾驶行为的多模态特性并生成更自然的轨迹，生成模型被引入。\n- **a. 生成对抗网络 (GANs)**：\n    - **代表工作**：（Jiang et al., 2023）。\n    - **改进**：能够生成多样化的轨迹。\n    - **局限**：训练不稳定，且缺乏推理时的自适应能力。\n- **b. 扩散模型 (Diffusion Models)**：\n    - **代表工作**：Diffusion Planner, Diffusion-es（Zheng et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2024）。\n    - **核心思想**：通过一个逐步去噪的过程生成轨迹，天然适合建模复杂的多模态分布。\n    - **重大改进**：\n        1.  **强大的多模态建模能力**：能同时生成多种合理轨迹，应对不确定性。\n        2.  **联合建模**：可以统一建模自车状态、他车历史、地图拓扑、导航指令等多种信息（如Diffusion Planner）。\n    - **核心局限（也是ReflexDiffusion的出发点）**：\n        1.  **分类器引导（CG）依赖**：许多方法依赖手工设计的、可微的分类器引导函数来注入物理或安全约束。这要求函数同时满足**连续性、多目标性、可计算性**，设计极其复杂，且往往为了可微而过度简化，在安全关键场景失效。\n        2.  **训练数据偏差**：模型在数据丰富的主流场景表现好，但在高横向加速度等长尾场景下，由于数据稀疏，会出现 **“曲率-速度解耦”** 问题，即规划的轨迹不满足向心力约束 `a_y = κv²`，导致车辆在弯道中失稳（如图2所示）。\n        3.  **单次推理，缺乏修正**：标准的扩散采样是单向去噪过程，一旦在早期步骤产生偏差，后续无法修正，错误会累积放大。\n\n#### 4. 推理时优化与反射机制 (Inference-time Optimization & Reflection)\n这是ReflexDiffusion所代表的**最新发展方向**，旨在不改变模型结构的前提下，在推理阶段动态提升规划质量。\n- **思想起源**：受大语言模型（LLMs）中 **“生成-评估-反思-精炼”** 循环的启发（Ji et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023）。\n- **核心改进（ReflexDiffusion的贡献）**：\n    1.  **训练策略增强（条件丢弃）**：在训练阶段，随机丢弃关键物理耦合特征（如道路曲率R、车速v），迫使模型在部分可观测下学习更鲁棒的表征，直接针对长尾场景中的物理失准问题。\n    2.  **无分类器引导（CFG）**：用CFG替代复杂的CG，通过条件与无条件预测的差异来隐式引导生成，更灵活。\n    3.  **开创性引入物理感知反射机制**：\n        - **反射触发**：设计轨迹置信度模块，实时评估轨迹的**运动学一致性、几何对齐度、安全裕度**，当置信度低于阈值时触发反射。\n        - **梯度注入**：在去噪迭代中，计算条件与无条件噪声预测的梯度差，这个梯度包含了关键的物理约束信息。通过一个投影矩阵 **P**，将该梯度显式地映射到向心力约束流形上。\n        - **迭代精炼**：将放大后的物理感知梯度重新注入到采样过程中，对轨迹进行“反思”和调整，强制其满足 `a_y ≈ κv²` 的耦合关系。这是一个**循环修正**的过程，打破了标准扩散的单向性。\n    4.  **架构无关的即插即用设计**：整个反射机制在推理阶段运行，无需修改底层扩散规划器的架构，可泛化到不同的扩散模型上（论文中在Diffusion Planner和Diffusion-es上均验证有效）。\n\n### 着重发展的几个不同方向\n\n从上述脉络可以看出，该领域主要沿着三个互补的方向深化：\n\n1.  **模型表达能力的增强方向**：\n    - 从**规则模型** -> **判别式学习模型** -> **生成式模型（扩散模型）**。\n    - 改进核心：不断提升对复杂、多模态驾驶行为分布的建模能力，从模仿单一模式到生成多种可能。\n\n2.  **物理与安全约束的融合方向**：\n    - 从**外部硬约束** -> **通过可微损失/引导函数软约束** -> **通过数据增强和推理时梯度注入内化约束**。\n    - 改进核心：如何更自然、更严格地将车辆动力学、道路几何等物理约束整合到数据驱动的模型中，特别是在数据稀缺的极限工况下。ReflexDiffusion的“反射”是实现深度内化的关键一步。\n\n3.  **推理时自适应与泛化能力提升方向**：\n    - 从**固定策略** -> **需要重新训练以适应** -> **无需改动模型的即插即用推理时优化**。\n    - 改进核心：解决长尾场景的核心矛盾——无法在训练数据中穷尽所有情况。ReflexDiffusion通过“反射”机制，使模型在**推理时**能利用现有知识进行动态自我调整和优化，用算法补偿数据不足，这是通向更高阶智能和可靠性的重要路径。\n\n**总结**：ReflexDiffusion站在扩散模型这一强大生成框架的肩膀上，通过引入来自LLM的“反射”范式，创造性地解决了该框架在安全临界场景下的核心痛点。它标志着轨迹规划的研究重点，从追求更复杂的模型结构，部分转向了**设计更智能的推理过程**，为实现更安全、更可靠的自动驾驶系统提供了新的思路和实用工具。",

            "answer": "## 评价指标与数据集分析\n\n### 一、 主要评价指标\n论文的核心评价指标是 **nuPlan 基准测试中的“驾驶分数 (Driving Score)**。该分数是一个综合性指标，用于在闭环仿真中全面评估规划器的性能。其具体构成如下表所示：\n\n| 指标类别 | 具体指标 | 描述与计算细节 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **核心安全指标** | **碰撞率** | 评估与车辆、行人、自行车等动态障碍物以及静态障碍物发生碰撞的频率。 |\n| | **可行驶区域违规率** | 评估轨迹偏离道路（如驶上路肩、草坪、隔离带等不可行驶区域）的频率。 |\n| | **时间到碰撞 (TTC)** | 衡量与最近障碍物发生碰撞的紧迫性，用于计算安全裕度（见公式15）。TTC低于阈值（如2.5秒）会降低安全分数。 |\n| **舒适性与合规性** | **舒适度违规** | 评估急加速、急减速和急转弯（高横向加速度）的频率，超过设定阈值会扣分。 |\n| | **交通规则遵守** | 评估是否遵守交通信号灯、停车标志、速度限制等规则。 |\n| **任务完成度** | **进度** | 衡量车辆沿着预定路线前进的距离比例。未能完成路线会降低分数。 |\n| **综合分数** | **驾驶分数** | 以上所有指标的加权综合得分。它是nuPlan挑战赛的官方排名指标，直接反映了规划器在**安全性、合规性、舒适性和效率**方面的整体表现。 |\n\n**论文中的特殊指标：**\n除了上述综合驾驶分数，论文还引入并分析了 **“轨迹置信度 (Trajectory Confidence)”**（公式13-15），这是一个**多因子复合指标**，用于在推理阶段内部评估生成轨迹的质量，并动态触发反射机制。其细节如下：\n- **运动学一致性 (`𝒟_kin`)**: 评估轨迹是否符合基本的车辆动力学约束，特别是**横向加速度 (`a_y`) 和横向加加速度 (`j_lat`)** 是否在合理范围内。公式中使用了参考加速度 (`a_y^ref`) 和最大加加速度 (`j_max`) 作为约束。\n- **几何对齐度 (`𝒢_align`)**: 量化轨迹与道路几何的贴合程度。包含两个子项：\n    - **曲率对齐 (`ℛ_curv`)**: 惩罚规划轨迹曲率 (`κ_τ`) 与道路曲率 (`κ_road`) 的差异，差异越大惩罚越重，尤其在弯道半径 (`R_curve`) 小时更敏感。\n    - **横向偏差 (`ℛ_dev`)**: 惩罚轨迹点 (`p_τ`) 相对于车道中心线 (`p_center`) 的最大横向偏差 (`d_dev`)，超过安全距离 (`d_safe`) 会线性降低分数。\n- **安全裕度 (`𝒮_margin`)**: 评估轨迹的主动安全缓冲。综合了：\n    - **碰撞时间 (TTC)**: 使用Sigmoid函数将TTC映射为风险分数。\n    - **可行驶区域违规概率 (`p_ODA`)**: 直接降低安全分数。\n    - **航向偏差 (`Δψ`)**: 车辆航向与道路切线方向的偏差，用余弦函数惩罚。\n\n### 二、 使用的数据集与基准\n论文主要在 **nuPlan** 数据集构建的特定测试基准上进行评估，专注于**长尾高风险场景**。\n\n| 数据集/基准名称 | 来源 | 细节与特点 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **nuPlan 数据集** | nuPlan Challenge | 大规模自动驾驶数据集，包含来自4个城市的真实驾驶日志，涵盖丰富的场景、天气和交通条件。提供高清地图、动态障碍物轨迹、自我状态等信息。 |\n| **Test14-hard 基准** | 基于nuPlan构建 (Cheng et al., 2024b) | **论文的核心评估基准。** 专门为评估**14种长尾、高风险场景**而设计。这些场景在常规数据中占比极少，但对安全性至关重要。论文重点关注其中 **“高横向加速度场景”** 的子集（定义见公式1）。 |\n| **Test14-random 基准** | 基于nuPlan构建 (Cheng et al., 2024b) | 作为**对照基准**。它同样覆盖14种场景类型，但场景是从nuPlan数据中**随机采样**得到的，代表了更普遍、更常见的驾驶情况。用于验证方法在常规场景下的性能是否下降。 |\n\n**高横向加速度场景的明确定义：**\n论文对核心测试场景给出了严格的数学定义（公式1）：在至少0.5秒 (`t_min`) 的持续时间内，车辆的瞬时横向加速度 (`|a_y(t)|`) 超过阈值4.0 m/s² (`a_th`)。这类场景包括**急转弯、U型弯、高速变道**等，车辆接近物理操控极限，对规划器的动力学建模能力要求极高。\n\n### 三、 评估设置细节\n1.  **闭环仿真**：所有实验均在nuPlan的闭环仿真环境中进行，规划器生成的轨迹会控制车辆运动，并接受环境反馈，能真实反映规划决策的长期后果。\n2.  **两种模式**：\n    - **非反应模式 (NR)**: 其他交通参与者按照日志记录的原轨迹运动，不响应自车行为。\n    - **反应模式 (R)**: 其他交通参与者使用智能驾驶员模型（IDM）等，会对自车行为做出反应，评估更具挑战性。\n3.  **对比基线全面**：涵盖了**基于规则的方法**（如IDM）、**基于学习的方法**（如模仿学习、强化学习、扩散模型）以及**混合方法**，确保了对比的公平性和说服力。\n4.  **效率评估**：论文专门测量了推理时间（表2），证明反射机制仅在必要时触发（≤0.5%的情况），平均延迟仅从35.7ms增加到36.1ms，保持了**>20Hz的实时性**，体现了其**实际部署价值**。\n\n**总结**：论文通过**驾驶分数**这一核心综合指标，在**专门针对长尾高风险场景设计的Test14-hard基准**上，系统性地评估了ReflexDiffusion的性能。同时，其自定义的**轨迹置信度指标**不仅作为内部触发机制，也作为分析工具，直观展示了反射过程如何优化轨迹以满足物理约束。这种评估体系紧密围绕其解决“高横向加速度场景规划”的核心问题，有效证明了其技术创新和实际价值。",

            "answer": "## 论文主要局限性分析\n\n基于对论文《ReflexDiffusion: Reflection-Enhanced Trajectory Planning for High-lateral-acceleration Scenarios in Autonomous Driving》的深入阅读，其核心局限性及未来改进方向总结如下：\n\n### 主要局限性\n\n1.  **计算开销与实时性权衡**\n    - **局限性**：反射机制在触发时会增加单步推理时间（从3.3 ms增至6.3 ms）。尽管论文声称在真实驾驶中触发频率低（≤0.5%），平均延迟可控（~36.1 ms），但这**依赖于一个关键假设**：高风险场景（高横向加速度）在整体驾驶中的占比确实极低。在极端或连续高风险场景下（如连续急弯赛道），频繁触发反射可能导致延迟累积，挑战实时性（>20 Hz）的硬性要求。\n    - **证据**：论文第5.2节（Table 2及相应分析）承认了单步延迟增加，其平均延迟计算基于对高风险场景发生频率的估计。\n\n2.  **反射触发的依赖性与泛化性**\n    - **局限性**：框架性能提升高度依赖于**轨迹置信度模块**的准确性和阈值（γ）的设定。该模块需要精确评估运动学一致性、几何对齐和安全边际。如果置信度评估本身在未知或更复杂的场景下失效（如传感器噪声极大、道路几何异常），反射机制可能无法被正确触发或产生错误修正，导致性能下降甚至引入新的风险。\n    - **证据**：第4.4节详细描述了置信度计算，第5.3节（Figure 4d）显示性能对阈值γ敏感，需在特定数据集上校准。\n\n3.  **物理模型简化与投影矩阵的固定性**\n    - **局限性**：反射模块中用于增强物理约束的**投影矩阵P**（公式10）基于简化的向心力模型 `a_y = κv²`。该模型假设了理想的道路-车辆耦合，未充分考虑**轮胎动力学、载荷转移、路面附着系数**等更复杂的真实车辆物理特性。在接近物理极限时，这些简化可能导致规划轨迹虽然满足简化模型，但实际执行时仍存在风险。\n    - **证据**：第3、4.3节将物理约束核心建模为 `a_y = κv²`，未引入更高级的车辆动力学模型。\n\n4.  **训练数据增强策略的局限性**\n    - **局限性**：训练阶段采用的**条件丢弃策略**（Conditional Dropout）通过随机丢弃关键特征（如道路曲率R、车速v）来模拟感知退化并增强鲁棒性。然而，这种丢弃是随机的，可能无法**系统性地覆盖所有类型的长尾数据缺失或耦合关系扭曲**，其增强效果有上限。\n    - **证据**：第4.1节描述了该策略，但未与更复杂的合成数据生成或对抗性训练等方法进行对比。\n\n5.  **评估场景的特定性**\n    - **局限性**：性能评估主要集中于nuPlan数据集中的高横向加速度场景（如U型弯）。虽然这紧扣主题，但未能充分证明方法在**其他类型长尾场景**（如极端天气、突发严重交通冲突、复杂人车混行）中的泛化能力。其“架构无关”的优势仍需在更广泛、更多样的基准和真实世界测试中验证。\n    - **证据**：第5节实验全部基于nuPlan的Test14-hard/random基准。\n\n### 未来可能的改进方向\n\n1.  **自适应与轻量化反射机制**\n    - **方向**：开发**自适应触发策略**，根据场景风险等级动态调整反射的迭代次数和计算深度，而非简单的二元触发。同时，研究**更轻量级的梯度投影或近似方法**，减少单次反射的计算开销，确保在最严苛的连续高风险场景下也能满足实时性。\n\n2.  **置信度模块的强化学习与多模态融合**\n    - **方向**：利用**离线或在线强化学习**来优化置信度评估策略，使其能直接从驾驶结果中学习何时以及如何进行反射修正更有效。此外，可以融合**多模态感知不确定性**（如视觉、激光雷达的置信度）作为轨迹置信度的输入，使评估更全面、更鲁棒。\n\n3.  **集成高阶车辆动力学模型**\n    - **方向**：将**更精确的车辆动力学模型**（如自行车模型甚至考虑轮胎魔术公式的模型）集成到反射模块的梯度投影中。可以设计一个可插拔的“物理引擎”层，根据车辆类型和实时状态（如胎压、磨损）动态调整约束条件，使规划更贴合实际物理极限。\n\n4.  **与前沿数据生成技术结合**\n    - **方向**：将反射机制与**基于扩散模型或世界模型的合成数据生成技术**结合。利用反射机制在推理时发现的“困难样本”来指导生成更具挑战性、物理耦合更复杂的训练场景，形成“**规划-发现-增强**”的闭环，从根本上改善基础扩散规划器的长尾性能。\n\n5.  **跨数据集与真实世界验证**\n    - **方向**：在**更广泛的数据集**（如Waymo Open Dataset, INTERACTION）和**硬件在环/实车测试平台**上进行验证。重点测试其在超出nuPlan分布范围的、定义更复杂的“边缘场景”中的表现，以全面证明其泛化能力和实际部署价值。\n\n**总结**：ReflexDiffusion的核心创新在于将LLM中的“反思”范式创造性地应用于轨迹规划的推理阶段，通过梯度操作显式强化物理约束，巧妙地规避了重新训练和数据稀缺问题。其当前局限性主要围绕**计算效率、模块依赖性、模型简化**和**评估广度**。未来的工作若能围绕**自适应优化、模型精细化、闭环数据增强**和**广泛验证**展开，将有望将其从一个针对特定问题的优秀解决方案，提升为自动驾驶规划系统中一个更通用、更强大的安全增强模块。",
