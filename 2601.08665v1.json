This architecture allows the model to leverage historical visual and linguistic memory, achieving SOTA results on several embodied navigation benchmarks. Furthermore, VLingNav can be deployed zero-shot on real-world robots to perform diverse and complex navigation tasks.\n1\nIntroduction\nEmbodied navigation\n[\n57\n]\nis a fundamental capability for intelligent robots, enabling purposeful movement through previously unseen, structurally complex environments in response to human instructions. As robots are increasingly deployed in open-world settings from household service scenarios to industrial inspection, navigation systems must deliver accurate perception and decision-making while robustly generalizing to novel scenes and tasks.\nTraditional modular approaches\n[\n8\n,\n65\n,\n9\n]\ndecompose navigation into submodules (e.g., perception, mapping, planning) by leveraging mature techniques such as visual foundation models\n[\n44\n,\n32\n]\n, SLAM\n[\n38\n,\n58\n]\n, and path-planning algorithms\n[\n21\n]\n. However, these pipelines require manually defined module interfaces; over-reliance on hand-crafted rules compromises robustness and induces error accumulation, limiting adaptability in dynamically complex environments. Recent advances in large-scale vision–language–action (VLA) models have made compelling progress toward this goal. By unifying multimodal scene understanding with language-conditioned action generation, VLA-based agents substantially improve the adaptability and expressiveness of embodied navigation systems.\nDespite this progress, current VLA models are reactive systems, often lacking the explicit reasoning mechanisms, memory structures, and interpretability that are important for reliable real-world deployment.\nMost existing models operate under a fixed inference budget, producing actions with a predetermined amount of computation, and therefore cannot increase deliberation when faced with ambiguity.\nIn addition, these models often lack persistent semantic memory, relying solely on limited context windows. Without a mechanism to retain historical context, agents struggle to track their progress over extended trajectories, resulting in redundant exploration, looping behaviors, and poor adaptation to dynamic changes in the environment.\nAddressing these limitations requires rethinking VLA architectures from a linguistic perspective, moving beyond passive perception-action mapping toward active reasoning, memory construction, and interpretable decision-making. Motivated by principles from cognitive science and human problem solving, we argue that effective embodied navigation demands two missing capabilities:\n1) adaptive reasoning, enabling the agent to adjust the granularity of its internal deliberation according to task complexity; and\n2) linguistically grounded long-term memory, providing stable cross-modal semantics that support consistent and context-aware navigation behavior.\nFurthermore, most current VLA training paradigms rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) via imitation learning. However, this approach often limits generalization, preventing models from performing beyond expert demonstrations. While post-training paradigms rooted in reinforcement learning (RL) have proven effective for enhancing LLMs and VLMs on complex tasks\n[\n16\n,\n47\n,\n13\n]\n, their application in embodied navigation remains preliminary\n[\n14\n,\n31\n,\n82\n]\n. Notably, existing efforts typically focus on autoregressive RL in discrete space, leaving the exploration of RL for refining continuous control policies an open area for further investigation.\nIn this work, we present VLingNav, a linguistic-driven VLA framework designed to endow embodied agents with cognitive abilities through two core components. First, inspired by the fast-and-slow thinking paradigm, we introduce an Adaptive Chain-of-Thought (AdaCoT) mechanism. AdaCoT dynamically triggers explicit reasoning only when necessary, allowing the agent to efficiently switch between fast reactive execution and deliberate planning depending on the situation. Second, to handle long-term spatial dependencies, we develop a Visual-assisted Linguistic Memory module (VLingMem). By constructing a persistent cross-modal memory, VLingMem enables the agent to recall past observations to prevent repetitive exploration and infer movement trends for dynamic tasks, thereby ensuring coherent decision-making over extended interactions.\nTo support the training of such cognitively enriched VLA models, we construct Nav-AdaCoT-2.9M, the largest embodied navigation dataset with reasoning annotations to date, incorporating adaptive CoT annotations that teach the model when to think and what to think about. Beyond imitation learning, we further employ online expert-guided RL for post-training, enabling VLingNav to acquire self-improving navigation behaviors that surpass the limitations of supervised demonstrations.\nExtensive experiments across diverse embodied navigation benchmarks show that VLingNav achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing VLA-based agents in both success rate and efficiency metrics. Notably, VLingNav transfers to real-world robots in a zero-shot manner, successfully executing novel navigation tasks in the real world without any additional fine-tuning. These results highlight the strong generalization ability of linguistic-driven cognition and demonstrate the promise of integrating adaptive reasoning and persistent memory into VLA models for embodied navigation. The contributions are as follows:\n•\nWe propose VLingNav, a novel framework integrating Adaptive Chain-of-Thought (AdaCoT) and Visual-Assisted Linguistic Memory (VLingMem). AdaCoT enables the agent to dynamically switch between fast execution and slow deliberation based on task complexity, while VLingMem eliminates redundant exploration and infers movement trends through persistent cross-modal storage.\n•\nWe construct Nav-AdaCoT-2.9M, the largest embodied navigation dataset with reasoning annotations to date, enriched with adaptive CoT annotations that induce flexible reasoning patterns. We further introduce an online expert-guided RL post-training stage, empowering the model to surpass the limitations of imitation learning and acquire more robust, self-optimized navigation behaviors.\n•\nWe conduct extensive experiments across standard embodied navigation benchmarks, demonstrating that VLingNav achieves state-of-the-art performance, with significant gains in long-horizon reasoning and success rate. Moreover, VLingNav exhibits remarkable zero-shot transfer to real-world robot platforms, successfully executing unseen tasks and illustrating strong cross-domain and cross-task generalization.\n2\nRelated Works\n2.1\nEmbodied Navigation Models\nAs a core task in robotics, navigation has long attracted significant attention from robotics researchers\n[\n11\n]\n. With the rise of embodied AI in recent years, robot navigation has gradually shifted from classical point-to-point navigation\n[\n22\n]\nto more intelligent embodied navigation. Embodied navigation includes subtasks such as vision-language navigation (VLN)\n[\n73\n,\n75\n,\n56\n,\n10\n,\n70\n]\n, object goal navigation (ObjectNav)\n[\n42\n,\n62\n,\n60\n]\n, image goal navigation (ImageNav)\n[\n25\n,\n59\n,\n63\n]\n, and embodied visual tracking (EVT)\n[\n52\n,\n84\n,\n30\n]\n, emphasizing that robots follow natural language instructions to perceive, reason, and plan in unseen environments.\nEmbodied navigation methods can be broadly categorized into modular and end-to-end approaches. The modular paradigm relies on well-established components such as off-the-shelf large models\n[\n85\n,\n86\n]\n, SLAM\n[\n38\n,\n5\n]\n, vision foundation models\n[\n71\n,\n39\n]\n, and planning algorithms\n[\n21\n]\n. It decomposes the navigation task into distinct modules (\ne\n.\ng\n., perception, localization, planning) and aligns them via manually defined interfaces. This design yields high interpretability and strong zero-shot transfer\n[\n63\n]\n. However, integrating multiple modules inevitably incurs information loss\n[\n34\n]\n; moreover, tight coupling across modules increases system fragility\n[\n34\n]\n.\nEnd-to-end approaches leverage data-driven learning to directly map sensor inputs to robot actions\n[\n59\n,\n66\n,\n69\n]\n. By removing manually designed interfaces and mitigating information loss, these methods have achieved notable progress\n[\n43\n,\n42\n]\n. However, they exhibit limited generalization and can produce abnormal actions under out-of-distribution conditions. With the rapid advancement of large models in recent years, an increasing number of studies have adopted pre-trained VLMs as the backbone to enhance generalization, environmental perception, and spatial understanding.\nNaVid\n[\n73\n]\nrepresents the first embodied navigation VLA model. It designs a video-based VLM and finetunes on VLN datasets, demonstrating robust generalization capabilities. However, its inference time increases significantly with longer video streams, making real-world deployment challenging.\nBuilding upon NaVid, Uni-NaVid\n[\n75\n]\nintroduces a video-stream compression mechanism to control the number of visual tokens. Moreover, Uni-NaVid extends the model to multiple categories of embodied navigation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks. Similarly, NaVILA\n[\n10\n]\nand StreamVLN\n[\n56\n]\nadopt similar architectures; they further incorporate large-scale open-world navigation data and leverage KV cache to jointly improve both generalization and inference speed.\nJanusVLN\n[\n70\n]\nenhances 3D understanding by fusing spatial features produced by VGGT\n[\n51\n]\n, thereby exhibiting strong instruction-following performance. Notably, all the aforementioned works represent robot actions as discrete tokens. This simplification leads to inefficient action quality and weak adaptability in dynamic scenarios.\nTo address this limitation, TrackVLA\n[\n52\n]\ndesigns an anchor-based diffusion policy that directly outputs the robot’s motion trajectory, substantially improving both action quality and efficiency. NavFoM\n[\n74\n]\nfurther extends the model by introducing TVI tokens, enabling inputs from cross-embodiment navigation data.\nNevertheless, existing navigation VLA models rely solely on action labels for finetuning and thus fail to exploit the inherent reasoning capabilities of VLMs\n[\n2\n,\n13\n]\n. In addition, they maintain history only through implicit visual features, without explicit memory, which ultimately prevents fully unlocking the potential of the VLM backbone.\n2.2\nEmbodied Chain-of-Thought\nWith the chain-of-thought significantly enhancing the performance of LLM and VLM on complex tasks\n[\n55\n,\n54\n,\n20\n]\n, several studies have attempted to extend this paradigm to embodied tasks. By explicitly outputting the reasoning process before a robot executes actions, the inherent reasoning capabilities of the VLM can be better leveraged. This approach aims to enhance the model’s competencies in task decomposition, environmental perception, and decision-making, ultimately improving the accuracy and quality of the actions generated by the model, as well as its generalization ability and performance in real-world scenarios. Embodied-CoT\n[\n68\n]\nfirst utilizes structured textual instructions enriched with spatial localization information. CoT-VLA\n[\n83\n]\nand VPP\n[\n19\n,\n72\n]\nintegrate reasoning via future image prediction.\nπ\n0.5\n\\pi_{0.5}\n[\n3\n]\nperforms task decomposition and reasoning through text.\nChatVLA-2\n[\n87\n]\nenhances the model’s performance in complex visual reasoning tasks by introducing additional open-world visual reasoning pre-training data. ThinkAct\n[\n20\n]\ndesigns a dual-system framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action. However, the aforementioned methods are limited to tabletop manipulation tasks and have not been extended to navigation in open spaces. OctoNav\n[\n14\n]\nimproves the model’s performance in navigation tasks and enhances interpretability by executing CoT at fixed frequency. However, the requirement for manual configuration of the CoT frequency impedes the full exploitation of CoT’s potential. Aux-Think\n[\n53\n]\nconstructs a VLN dataset with CoT labeling, and experiments show that using CoT as an auxiliary task during training enhances the model’s navigation performance, while excessive reasoning affects the model’s efficiency and performance.\nN\n​\na\n​\nv\n​\nA\n3\nNavA^{3}\n[\n76\n]\nadopts GPT-4o as the reasoning-VLM for task decomposition and 3D spatial localization, but it suffers from long reasoning latency, making it difficult to deploy on real robots.\nIn contrast to previous work, we propose an adaptive thinking strategy that balances reasoning efficiency with navigation capability.\n2.3\nMemory in VLA Models\nFor long-horizon embodied tasks, VLA models must possess robust memory capabilities. RoboFlamingo\n[\n27\n]\n, for instance, compresses vision–language representations into latent tokens and propagates them through a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. However, the resulting latent representations are relatively coarse-grained, leading to a significant loss of fine-grained perceptual history.\nIn contrast, MemoryVLA\n[\n48\n]\nintegrates high-level cognitive semantics and fine-grained perceptual details within a unified memory framework, enabling effective temporal modeling for long-horizon manipulation tasks. However, it only employs a single implicit cognitive token to serve as the semantic memory, failing to fully leverage the reasoning capabilities of LLM.\nOn the navigation side, video-based VLA models\n[\n73\n,\n75\n,\n10\n,\n56\n,\n52\n,\n30\n]\ncommonly encode historical image observations as inputs to provide implicit visual memory. However, such implicit memory can hinder learning to focus on key regions, and semantic information is further degraded as visual features are repeatedly compressed.\nFinally, Mem2Ego\n[\n78\n]\nand MapNav\n[\n77\n]\nincorporate global map information into VLA models as memory components. Yet current VLM backbones lack native support for map-format inputs, and the representation design of maps for VLAs remains under-explored.\nCompared with latent-, vision-, or map-based memories, language memory is better aligned with the VLA framework, thanks to large-scale language pretraining. Therefore, we design the memory module from a linguistic perspective and use visual features as auxiliary signals.\n2.4\nPost-training for VLA Models\nReinforcement Learning enhances the exploration capability of large models, unlocks their reasoning potential, and shows promise for mitigating issues such as covariate shift and causal confusion induced by imitation learning. Notably, OctoNav\n[\n14\n]\n, VLN-R1\n[\n37\n]\n, and Nav-R1\n[\n31\n]\nhave convergently integrated GRPO\n[\n47\n]\ninto navigation VLA models, enabling the simultaneous optimization of CoT outputs and actions.\nFigure 2\n:\nThe overall framework of VLingNav.\nThe framework takes video streams and multimodal instruction as input to produce robot action for navigation with tailored linguistic designs. AdaCoT can adaptively generate linguistic thinking according to its observation, while VLingMem summarizes CoT cues with key visual features for globally informed decision-making.\nRecent advances in large reasoning models (\ne\n.\ng\n.,\nDeepSeek-R1\n[\n16\n]\n) show that RL can drive remarkable progress even when relying solely on outcome-based rewards. Several studies have also attempted to leverage outcome-based rewards for the RL post-training of VLA models. For instance, SimpleVLA-RL\n[\n26\n]\npioneers outcome-based rewards for the RL post-training of OpenVLA-OFT\n[\n23\n]\n, achieving a substantial improvement in success rate on the manipulation benchmarks. ActiveVLN\n[\n82\n]\n, caches all historical actions and states into model tokens and leverages GRPO to implement outcome-based RL through this mechanism.\nThe aforementioned work remains confined to autoregressive action outputs, failing to support more advanced continuous action prediction. Recently, ReinFlow\n[\n80\n]\naddresses this by formulating flow matching as an MDP, enabling RL training via PPO\n[\n45\n]\nor GRPO.\nExisting VLA-RL frameworks either adopt discrete autoregressive action with limited policy space or continual flow-based action with slow inference speed. We adopt an MLP-based continuous action to overcome the above drawbacks. In addition, we introduce prior expert knowledge into the RL framework to improve online learning efficiency and performance.\n3\nMethodology\n3.1\nNavigation Task Definitions\nEmbodied navigation tasks can be defined as follows: a mobile robot is provided with an instruction\nℐ\n\\mathcal{I}\nand a sequence of visual observations\n𝒪\n1\n:\nt\n∈\nℝ\nW\n×\nH\n×\n3\n\\mathcal{O}_{1:t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{W\\times H\\times 3}\n, captured by the egocentric camera mounted on the robot at each time step\n{\n1\n,\n…\n,\nt\n}\n\\{1,...,t\\}\n. Given these observations and the instruction, the policy model\nπ\n\\pi\nis required to output the next action\na\nt\n∈\n𝔸\n=\n{\nv\n,\nω\n}\na_{t}\\in\\mathbb{A}=\\{v,\\omega\\}\nfor the robot. The robot accomplishes the navigation task by executing the action predicted by the model, which can be formulated as\na\nt\n=\nπ\n​\n(\nℐ\n,\n𝒪\n1\n:\nt\n)\na_{t}=\\pi(\\mathcal{I},\\mathcal{O}_{1:t})\n. VLingNav is capable of performing multiple embodied navigation tasks, including ObjectNav, EVT, and ImageNav. ObjectNav requires the robot to explore unseen environments given a textual description of an object category and to locate an object that matches the specified goal. EVT focuses on identifying the correct target described by textual instructions in dynamic, crowded scenarios and maintaining continuous tracking of the moving target. ImageNav is analogous to ObjectNav, with the key difference that the goal is specified by an image rather than text. Similarly, the robot must explore unseen environments and find the location corresponding to the image goal.\n3.2\nVLingNav Overview\nVLingNav extends a video-based VLM, specifically LLaVA-Video-7B\n[\n81\n]\n, and integrates an action model to enable simultaneous text token generation and trajectory planning. For text token prediction, the model follows a conventional autoregressive paradigm. For trajectory planning, the action model conditions on the VLM backbone’s outputs to predict a motion trajectory\nτ\n=\n{\na\n1\n,\na\n2\n,\n…\n​\na\nn\n}\n\\tau=\\{a_{1},a_{2},\\dots\\,a_{n}\\}\n, where\nn\nn\nis the trajectory horizon and each\na\n∈\nℝ\n3\n=\n(\nx\n,\ny\n,\nθ\n)\na\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}=(x,y,\\theta)\ndenotes a waypoint that encapsulates both position and orientation.\n3.3\nVLingNav Architecture\n3.3.1\nObservation Encoding\nFor the video-based VLA model, the number of image frames grows over time during online inference. This substantially increases computational burden, making it difficult to ensure inference efficiency when deploying on real robots. Moreover, for low-speed mobile robots, adjacent egocentric frames captured at high FPS contain substantial redundant visual information.\nPrior studies explore two main strategies to mitigate this issue. One merges visual tokens from historical frames to reduce redundancy among adjacent frames\n[\n75\n,\n4\n]\n; however, this operation often distorts original semantic features and introduces additional computation. The other uniformly samples the video stream to reduce frame count\n[\n10\n]\n, which inevitably causes delayed and inaccurate decisions due to insufficient short-term observations at low sampling rates.\nTo address the limitations of these two approaches, we propose a dynamic FPS sampling strategy. Inspired by the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve\n[\n12\n]\n, historical frames are sampled according to their time intervals relative to the current frame. Specifically, older historical frames, regarded as long-term memory, are sampled at a lower rate to simulate the forgetting process. In contrast, recent historical frames, considered as short-term memory, are sampled at a guaranteed higher rate. The relationship between the sampling rate and the time interval approximately satisfies the following:\nf\ns\n​\n(\ni\n)\n=\nf\ns\nm\n​\na\n​\nx\n​\ne\n−\nΔ\n​\nT\ns\nf_{s}(i)=f_{s}^{max}e^{-\\frac{\\Delta T}{s}}\n(1)\nwhere\nf\ns\nf_{s}\ndenotes the sampling rate,\nf\ns\nm\n​\na\n​\nx\nf_{s}^{max}\nrepresents the maximum sampling rate,\nΔ\n​\nT\n=\nt\n−\ni\n\\Delta T=t-i\nstands for the time interval from latest frame\nt\nt\nto frame\ni\ni\n, and\ns\ns\nsignifies the stability of memory. Through this approach, we can control the number of input image tokens while selectively preserving more important images.\nAfter sampling the input visual observations, we need to encode and map the visual observations into the latent space of the VLM backbone. Following LLaVA-Video, we employ a pre-trained vision encoder (SigLIP-400M\n[\n71\n]\n), to encode the input egocentric video stream\n𝒪\n1\n:\nt\n=\n{\n𝐨\n1\n,\n⋯\n,\n𝐨\nt\n}\n\\mathcal{O}_{1:t}=\\{\\mathbf{o}_{1},\\cdots,\\mathbf{o}_{t}\\}\nof the robot. This encoding process yields visual features\n𝐕\n1\n:\nt\n∈\nℝ\nN\n×\nC\n\\mathbf{V}_{1:t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N\\times C}\n, where\nN\nN\nstands for the number of image patches (\nN\n=\n729\nN=729\n) and\nC\nC\ndenotes the embedding dimension (\nC\n=\n1152\nC=1152\n). To efficiently summarize historical visual information, we process past observations using a grid pooling strategy. This approach downsamples the feature maps of historical observations, enabling the model to capture high-level semantic features while effectively controlling computational costs. Similar to dynamic FPS, we also determine the downsampling ratio for grid pooling based on time intervals. The specific operation is defined as follows:\ng\n​\n(\ni\n)\n\\displaystyle g(i)\n=\n⌊\ne\n−\nΔ\n​\nT\ng\n⌋\n\\displaystyle=\\lfloor e^{-\\frac{\\Delta T}{g}}\\rfloor\n(2)\n𝐕\nt\ni\n′\n\\displaystyle\\mathbf{V}^{\\prime}_{t_{i}}\n=\n𝒢\n​\n(\n𝐕\nt\ni\n,\ng\n​\n(\ni\n)\n)\n\\displaystyle=\\mathcal{G}(\\mathbf{V}_{t_{i}},g(i))\n(3)\nwhere\n𝐕\nt\ni\n′\n\\mathbf{V}^{\\prime}_{t_{i}}\nis the\ni\ni\n-th visual feature after grid pooling operation\n𝒢\n​\n(\n⋅\n)\n\\mathcal{G(\\cdot)}\nwith stride\ng\n​\n(\ni\n)\ng(i)\n.\nFurthermore, to eliminate the temporal inconsistency in the video stream caused by dynamic FPS sampling, we incorporate timestamp information for each frame within the visual observations. Specifically, a temporal-aware indicator token\nE\nT\n​\n(\n⋅\n)\n∈\nℝ\nC\nE^{T}(\\cdot)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{C}\nis introduced prior to each frame, which can reflect the time interval between a given historical visual observation and the current observation. By encoding timestamp information using Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE)\n[\n49\n]\n,\nE\nT\nE^{T}\nenables the model to perceive the absolute time interval between different historical frames and the current frame. It can be expressed as follows:\nE\nT\n​\n(\nΔ\n​\nT\n)\n=\nE\nb\n​\na\n​\ns\n​\ne\nT\n+\nR\n​\no\n​\nP\n​\nE\n​\n(\nΔ\n​\nT\n)\nE^{T}(\\Delta T)=E^{T}_{base}+RoPE(\\Delta T)\n(4)\nFor the projection of visual features, we follow the well-established framework of VLMs\n[\n29\n]\n. Specifically, a cross-modality projector based on a two-layer Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)\n𝒫\n​\n(\n⋅\n)\n\\mathcal{P}(\\cdot)\nis employed to map the visual features\n𝐕\n\\mathbf{V}\ninto the latent space of the VLM, yielding the projection result as\n𝐄\nt\nV\n=\n𝒫\n​\n(\n𝐕\nt\n′\n)\n\\mathbf{E}^{V}_{t}=\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbf{V}_{t}^{{}^{\\prime}})\n, where\n𝐄\nt\nV\n\\mathbf{E}^{V}_{t}\nrepresents the projected visual token.\n3.3.2\nAdaptive CoT & Visual-Assisted Linguistic Memory\nAs illustrated in Fig.\n2\n, we concatenate the visual tokens\n𝐄\nt\nV\n\\mathbf{E}_{t}^{V}\nwith the language tokens\n𝐄\nI\n\\mathbf{E}^{I}\nand the temporal-aware indicator tokens\n𝐄\nT\n\\mathbf{E}^{T}\nto form the input sequence of the VLM. To balance the model’s inference performance and efficiency, we train the model using a large scale high-quality adaptive CoT data (detailed in Sec.\n4\n) endowing it with the ability to autonomously decide whether to perform CoT reasoning for a given input. Specifically, for the current input, the VLM first predicts a CoT indicator token (\n<think_on>\nor\n<think_off>\n). Upon outputting\n<think_on>\n, the model generates the specific content of CoT in an autoregressive manner, which consists of two components:\n•\nThe reasoning content, enclosed within\n<think>\nand\n</think>\ntokens. This content includes perception of the visual observation, task decomposition and analysis, assessment of whether the current location has been visited, and determination of the next action.\n•\nThe environmental summary of the current observation, enclosed within\n<summary>\nand\n</summary>\ntokens.

Tab.\n1\npresents a statistical comparison between Nav-AdaCoT-2.9M and existing public embodied navigation datasets, evaluating metrics such as scene number, task type, total steps, CoT annotation number, and action modalities.\nNotably, our dataset surpasses others in scene number, task variety, and input modality richness. It also features the largest count of CoT annotations to date. Furthermore, Nav-AdaCoT-2.9M employs trajectory-based annotation, which provides finer-grained supervision compared to discrete action-based datasets.\n4.1\nEmbodied Navigation Data\n4.1.1\nNavigation Data Generation\nTo ensure both diversity and comparability, we construct our training data from several widely used embodied navigation benchmarks.\nObject-Goal Navigation.\nWe use data from three benchmarks:\n•\nHM3D ObjNav\n[\n41\n]\n: For this category-level search task, we utilize a subset of the human demonstration data provided by Habitat-Web\n[\n42\n]\n.\n•\nMP3D ObjNav\n[\n7\n]\n: We collect shortest-path trajectories to serve as training data.\n•\nHM3D OVON\n[\n66\n]\n: For this zero-shot, open-vocabulary task, we also collect shortest-path trajectories.\nVisual Tracking.\nWe leverage EVT-Bench\n[\n52\n]\nto curate a multi-person indoor tracking dataset.\nImage-Goal Navigation.\nWe use the HM3D Instance ImageNav\n[\n24\n]\nbenchmark. For this, we also generate shortest-path trajectories and derive step-by-step action labels.\nLeveraging these existing resources, we propose Nav-AdaCoT-2.9M, a large-scale dataset encompassing 2.9M step-by-step adaptive Chain-of-Thought trajectories. Distinct from prior datasets that predominantly furnish only instructions and expert action labels, Nav-AdaCoT-2.9M explicitly integrates structured reasoning that is aligned with observations and instructions. This design effectively bridges the domains of perception, language, and action. As the cornerstone for the supervised fine-tuning phase of VLingNav, this dataset facilitates the acquisition of structured reasoning capabilities in VLingNav prior to the reinforcement learning-based post-training.\nFigure 4\n:\nThe autonomous adaptive CoT labeling pipeline of VLingNav.\n4.1.2\nAutonomous Adaptive CoT labeling pipeline\nWe propose an autonomous adaptive Chain-of-Thought data labeling pipeline, specifically designed to construct high-quality CoT labels for embodied navigation and reasoning tasks. This pipeline leverages the reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models to generate coherent, step-by-step CoT rationales that justify navigation decisions in complex environments. As illustrated in Fig.\n4\n, we applied adaptive CoT labeling to the entire embodied navigation dataset described in the previous section.\nTo generate high-quality Chain-of-Thought labels, we designed a composite prompt for Qwen2.5-VL-72B\n[\n2\n]\nthat incorporates five essential components: 1) navigation instructions, 2) egocentric visual stream input (the most recent 10 frames, included to reduce the computational load of the VLM), 3) prior memory content, 4) expert trajectories at each step, and 5) explicit formatting requirements. This prompt guides the VLM to reason about spatial relationships, environmental constraints, and the semantic meaning of instructions, thereby generating structured, step-by-step CoT sequences. The outputs follow a standardized format: reasoning processes are enclosed within\n<think>\n​\n⋯\n​\n</think>\n\\texttt{<think>}\\cdots\\texttt{</think>}\ntags, while summaries are contained in\n<summary>\n​\n⋯\n​\n</summary>\n\\texttt{<summary>}\\cdots\\texttt{</summary>}\ntags. This formatting ensures transparent alignment among observations, reasoning, and memory.\nWhen this pipeline was executed across our diverse set of environments, approximately 472K CoT responses were generated from 2.9M samples. Each response includes a detailed CoT analysis and decision-making process for the navigation scenario, as well as linguistic memory describing the current environmental context. These raw outputs were further refined through a two-stage filtering procedure:\n1) Rule-based checks: Responses that were incomplete or logically inconsistent were discarded.\n2) Quality verification: Decisions were cross-validated against expert navigation trajectories to ensure accuracy.\nFollowing refinement, we constructed the Nav-AdaCoT-2.9M dataset. Serving as the Supervised Fine-Tuning data for VLingNav, this dataset provides rich reasoning trajectories that tightly integrate perception, instruction following, and navigation decision-making.\n4.2\nOpen-World Video Data\nFurthermore, co-training with open-world video data has been shown in multiple studies\n[\n75\n,\n56\n,\n3\n]\nto enhance model generalization and reduce the sim-to-real transfer gap. Consistent with these findings, we incorporate a variety of publicly available open-world video datasets\n[\n1\n,\n81\n,\n13\n]\ninto our training data. Beyond prior efforts, our approach not only improves general visual understanding but also further strengthens adaptive reasoning through additional adaptive CoT annotations. Specifically, we utilize three datasets, LLaVA-Video-178K\n[\n81\n]\n, Video-R1\n[\n13\n]\n, and ScanQA\n[\n1\n]\n, comprising a total of 1.6M samples, and construct an adaptive CoT-based video dataset by categorizing samples according to difficulty. In particular, the Video-R1 dataset, which contains relatively challenging video QA pairs, is organized as a CoT-annotated subset, whereas the other two datasets are formatted as non-CoT subsets. This design enables the model to further develop the ability to autonomously decide whether reasoning is required for a given input.\n4.3\nDataset Statistics\nUltimately, the training dataset for VLingNav comprises the two aforementioned types of datasets, totaling 4.5M training samples. Specifically, it includes 2.9M samples of embodied navigation data and 1.6M samples of open-world video data, with the detailed data distribution illustrated in Fig.\n3\n.\n5\nTraining Recipe\nFigure 5\n:\nOnline post-training with a hybrid rollout procedure.\n5.1\nModel Pre-train\nThe VLM backbone used in VLingNav does not natively support adaptive reasoning. To address this, we first conduct a pre-training stage on our custom open-world adaptive CoT video dataset (detailed in Sec.\n4\n). Following standard VLM training paradigms, we fine-tune the model for a single epoch. This process equips the model with the foundational ability to perform adaptive visual reasoning. The training is supervised using a standard cross-entropy (CE) loss, applied at the token level.\n5.2\nSupervised Fine-Tuning\nFollowing the pre-training phase, we perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to establish robust navigation and video reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we train the model using standard imitation learning on a combined dataset that integrates our embodied navigation data with the open-world video data. This co-training strategy ensures the model retains general-purpose visual reasoning while acquiring task-specific navigation skills. The training objective can be formalized as:\nmin\nθ\n⁡\nℒ\nSFT\n​\n(\nθ\n)\n=\nα\n​\nℒ\nMSE\n​\n(\nτ\n^\nt\n,\nτ\nt\ng\n​\nt\n)\n+\n(\n1\n−\nα\n)\n​\nℒ\nCE\n​\n(\nE\nt\np\n​\nr\n​\ne\n​\nd\n,\nE\nt\ng\n​\nt\n)\n\\min_{\\theta}\\;\\;\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{SFT}}(\\theta)=\\alpha\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{MSE}}(\\hat{\\tau}_{t},\\tau_{t}^{gt})+(1-\\alpha)\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{CE}}(E_{t}^{pred},E_{t}^{gt})\n(6)\nwhere\nℒ\nMSE\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{MSE}}\nis the Mean Squared Error loss that supervises the predicted action trajectory\nτ\n^\nt\n\\hat{\\tau}_{t}\nagainst the ground-truth trajectory\nτ\nt\ng\n​\nt\n\\tau^{gt}_{t}\n,\nℒ\nCE\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{CE}}\nis the Cross-Entropy loss that supervises the generation of all textual outputs, including both the CoT reasoning and the VQA responses.\nα\n\\alpha\nis a hyperparameter that balances the contribution of the two loss components.\n5.3\nOnline Expert-guided Post-training\nTo address the limitations of offline imitation learning, such as covariate shift, and to better align the VLM’s high-level representations with the closed-loop robot continuous action, we introduce an online post-training stage.\nStarting from the SFT checkpoint, the agent actively interacts with the simulation environment to collect fresh, on-policy trajectories. The policy is then updated using a hybrid objective function. This objective combines outcome-driven optimization with expert-guided supervision. This dual approach allows the model to explore more effective strategies while preventing catastrophic forgetting of the expert policy.\n5.3.1\nProbabilistic Continuous Action Model\nExisting VLA architectures often employ discrete tokenization for actions, which sacrifices precision; others use generative models like diffusion or flow matching, which incur high computational costs due to iterative denoising. To address this trade-off between high-precision continuous control and efficient inference, we propose a lightweight probabilistic projection head.\nLet\n𝐡\nt\n\\mathbf{h}_{t}\ndenote the visual-linguistic features extracted from the VLM backbone at timestep\nt\nt\n. We parameterize the policy\nπ\nθ\n​\n(\n𝐚\nt\n|\n𝐬\nt\n)\n\\pi_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{a}_{t}|\\mathbf{s}_{t})\nas a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Specifically, the action head projects\n𝐡\nt\n\\mathbf{h}_{t}\nto predict the mean\n𝝁\nθ\n​\n(\n𝐡\nt\n)\n\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{h}_{t})\nand the logarithm of the standard deviation\nlog\n⁡\n𝝈\nθ\n​\n(\n𝐡\nt\n)\n\\log\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{h}_{t})\n:\nπ\nθ\n​\n(\n𝐚\nt\n|\n𝐬\nt\n)\n=\n𝒩\n​\n(\n𝝁\nθ\n​\n(\n𝐡\nt\n)\n,\ndiag\n​\n(\n𝝈\nθ\n​\n(\n𝐡\nt\n)\n2\n)\n)\n\\pi_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{a}_{t}|\\mathbf{s}_{t})=\\mathcal{N}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{h}_{t}),\\text{diag}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{h}_{t})^{2}\\right)\\right)\n(7)\nDuring online post-training rollout, stochastic exploration is implemented by sampling actions\n𝐚\nt\n\\mathbf{a}_{t}\nfrom the policy distribution\n𝐚\nt\n∼\nπ\nθ\n(\n⋅\n∣\n𝐬\nt\n)\n\\mathbf{a}_{t}\\sim\\pi_{\\theta}(\\cdot\\mid\\mathbf{s}_{t})\n. In contrast, for the validation phase, deterministic execution is adopted, where actions\n𝐚\nt\n\\mathbf{a}_{t}\nare set to the mean value\n𝐚\nt\n=\n𝝁\nθ\n​\n(\n𝐡\nt\n)\n\\mathbf{a}_{t}=\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{h}_{t})\nof the policy’s action distribution conditioned on the hidden state\n𝐡\nt\n\\mathbf{h}_{t}\n.\n5.3.2\nHybrid Rollout\nTo balance exploration with successful task completion, we employ a hybrid data collection strategy. As illustrated in Fig.\n5\n, we alternate between two rollout modes:\n•\nNaive rollout: The current policy\nπ\nθ\n\\pi_{\\theta}\ninteracts with the environment independently. We store the complete interaction trajectories\nτ\n=\n{\n(\n𝐬\nt\n,\n𝐚\nt\n,\nr\nt\n)\n}\n\\tau=\\{(\\mathbf{s}_{t},\\mathbf{a}_{t},r_{t})\\}\n, and only successful trajectories are filtered out and incorporated into the hybrid buffer. As on-policy data, this dataset accurately reflects the current policy’s capabilities and provides high-quality positive examples for reinforcing successful action sequences.\n•\nExpert-guided rollout: To address inefficient exploration and mitigate erroneous behaviors, the system incorporates an expert policy\nπ\n∗\n\\pi^{*}\n(implemented via a Shortest Path planner in simulator). When the agent triggers an irrational condition (\ne\n.\ng\n., oscillating or stuck for\nk\nk\nsteps, here\nk\n=\n15\nk=15\n) or eventually fails. By taking control and demonstrating a recovery path, the expert provides high-quality, corrective trajectories. These demonstrations are then added to the hybrid buffer, enriching it with valuable examples of how to escape difficult states and improving overall agent robustness.\n5.3.3\nOnline Fine-tuning with Augmented Loss\nPure reinforcement learning can be unstable and sample-inefficient under sparse rewards and long horizons, while pure imitation learning may overfit to the expert state distribution and suffer from covariate shift. We therefore adopt a demonstration-augmented online post-training scheme\n[\n40\n]\n, where interaction data provides an outcome-driven learning signal and expert-guided trajectories provide a stabilizing supervised signal. Specially, we optimize the following composite objective:\nmin\nθ\n⁡\nℒ\npost\n​\n(\nθ\n)\n\\displaystyle\\min_{\\theta}\\;\\;\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{post}}(\\theta)\n=\nλ\n​\nℒ\nRL\n​\n(\nθ\n)\n+\n(\n1\n−\nλ\n)\n​\nℒ\nSFT\n​\n(\nθ\n)\n\\displaystyle=\\lambda\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{RL}}(\\theta)+(1-\\lambda)\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{SFT}}(\\theta)\n(8)\nwhere\n​\nℒ\nRL\n​\n(\nθ\n)\n\\displaystyle\\text{where }\\;\\;\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{RL}}(\\theta)\n=\n−\n𝔼\nt\n​\n[\nmin\n⁡\n(\nr\nt\n​\n(\nθ\n)\n​\nA\nt\n,\nclip\n​\n(\nr\nt\n​\n(\nθ\n)\n,\n1\n−\nϵ\n,\n1\n+\nϵ\n)\n​\nA\nt\n)\n]\n,\n\\displaystyle=-\\mathbb{E}_{t}\\left[\\min\\Big(r_{t}(\\theta)A_{t},\\;\\mathrm{clip}(r_{t}(\\theta),1-\\epsilon,1+\\epsilon)\\,A_{t}\\Big)\\right],\nwhere\nℒ\nRL\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{RL}}\nis a PPO-style policy-gradient objective,and we use REINFORCE++\n[\n18\n]\nto calculate the advantage\nA\nt\nA_{t}\n.\nℒ\nSFT\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{SFT}}\nis the imitation loss defined in Eq.\n6\n.\n5.4\nImplementation Details\n5.4.1\nTraining Details\nVLingNav is trained on a cluster with 128 NVIDIA A100 GPUs using a three-stage training pipeline. In the first stage, we leverage open-world video data for pre-training to endow the model with adaptive general visual reasoning capabilities. Consistent with standard VLM practices\n[\n29\n]\n, this pre-training runs for a single epoch. In the second stage, all embodied navigation data and open-world video data are mixed and randomly shuffled for co-training 20K steps with a total batch size of 512. In the online post-training phase, the policy undergoes 10 rollout iterations of updates using the training datasets of HM3D OVON, HM3D Instance ImageNav and EVT-Bench DT benchmarks. For each iteration, we use the current policy to collect 128 episodes of on-policy data, which are then added to the hybrid buffer before the model is updated. For open-world video data, all videos are sampled at 1 FPS to reduce redundancy between consecutive frames. Throughout all stage training, only the visual encoder’s parameters are frozen; all other components are updated. The hyperparameters are set to\nα\n=\n0.5\n\\alpha=0.5\nand\nλ\n=\n0.01\n\\lambda=0.01\n, which is determined by the scale of different losses.\n5.4.2\nInference Details\nDuring inference, we maintain a compact and consistent model architecture by not using task-specific tokens for task partitioning. Instead, at each step, the model autoregressively predicts a CoT indicator token. Based on this indicator, it may then generate CoT content. Finally, the hidden state corresponding to the last generated token is fed into the action module, which predicts the robot’s future motion trajectory.\n6\nExperiments\nTo comprehensively evaluate the performance of VLingNav, we conducted a series of extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world. We first quantitatively compare VLingNav against state-of-the-art methods on several standard embodied navigation benchmarks. We then conduct detailed ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of each of our proposed key components. Furthermore, we have validated that the proposed model framework and training recipe in VLingNav demonstrate emergent generalization capabilities across diverse domains and tasks. Finally, we demonstrate VLingNav’s ability to transfer to a real-world robot and complete practical navigation tasks in a zero-shot manner, verifying its real-world generalization and utility.\n6.1\nExperiment Setups\n6.1.1\nBenchmarks.\nOur method is evaluated on multiple public benchmarks, including those for Object Goal Navigation (HM3Dv1 ObjNav, HM3Dv2 ObjNav, MP3D ObjNav, and HM3D OVON), Embodied Visual Tracking (EVT-Bench), and Image Goal Navigation (HM3D Instance ImageNav). Notably, a shared model checkpoint is used across all tasks, with no additional fine-tuning performed for any individual task.\n6.1.2\nBaselines.\nWe conduct a comprehensive comparison of VLingNav against current state-of-the-art models, categorized into three groups: (1) modular methods, often separate the model into perception, mapping and planning,\ni\n.\ne\n.\n[\n66\n,\n63\n,\n62\n,\n67\n,\n74\n,\n8\n,\n25\n,\n79\n]\n, (2) end-to-end small-scale models often leverage a pre-trained network for visual feature extraction, which are then integrated with a policy network to output robot actions,\ni\n.\ne\n.\n[\n42\n,\n43\n,\n66\n,\n64\n,\n84\n,\n69\n]\n, and (3) VLA models\n[\n75\n,\n52\n,\n74\n,\n30\n,\n31\n,\n89\n]\n.\n6.1.3\nMetrics.\nTo evaluate navigation performance, we use standard metrics from public benchmarks, including Success Rate (SR), Success-weighted Path Length (SPL), Tracking Rate (TR), and Collision Rate (CR).\n6.2\nSimulation Experiments\n6.2.1\nObject Goal Navigation\nTable 2:\nPerformance on object goal navigation.\nComparison on HM3D ObjNav\n[\n41\n]\nand MP3D ObjNav\n[\n7\n]\nbenchmarks.

Specifically, our evaluations were conducted across multiple publicly available benchmarks including HM3Dv1, HM3Dv2, MP3D and HM3D OVON.\nAs presented in Tab.\n2\n, VLingNav achieved SOTA performance on three closed-vocabulary benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior methods on both SR and SPL metrics. On HM3Dv1, VLingNav reaches 79.1 SR and 42.9 SPL, improving over previous SOTA video-based VLA model Uni-NaVid (73.7/37.1) by +5.4 SR (+7.3%) and +3.9 SPL (+15.6%). A comparable performance improvement is also observed in HM3Dv2, where VLingNav achieves 83.0 SR and 40.5 SPL, surpassing FiLM-Nav (77.0/41.3) by +6.0 SR (+7.8%). It is noted that the SPL result achieved by our method is slightly lower than that of FiLM-Nav. This discrepancy primarily arises because the FiLM-Nav model only selects the next frontier position and then relies on a shortest path planner to reach it—an approach that confers greater advantages in the simulator compared to our method, which directly outputs trajectory-based actions. On the MP3D benchmark—where long-range exploration scenarios predominate—VLingNav achieves an SR of 58.9 and an SPL of 26.5. These results significantly outperform those of the prior SOTA methods CogNav (46.6/16.1) and ApexNav (39.2/17.8). Specifically, our method yields an +26.4% improvement in SR and a substantial +32.8% enhancement in SPL. This impressive result demonstrates that VLingNav possesses robust exploration and memory capabilities, validating its effectiveness in complex long-range navigation tasks. Collectively, these results show that VLingNav not only exhibits enhanced object-exploration capabilities in diverse and challenging unseen environments, but also produces substantially shorter and more efficient trajectories across benchmark tests, highlighting the benefits of adaptive reasoning and long-horizon linguistic memory in the Object Goal Navigation task.\nTo further validate the generalization capability of VLingNav, we evaluate its performance on HM3D OVON—a more challenging open-vocabulary object navigation benchmark. This benchmark comprises three distinct test splits: (1)\nval seen\n, which includes object categories present in the training set; (2)\nval seen synonym\n, which consists of goal categories synonymous with those encountered during training; and (3)\nval unseen\n, which contains object categories not present in the training dataset. As illustrated in Tab.\n3\n, VLingNav achieves the best performance across all three test splits, with SRs improved by 0.9 (+1.5%), 8.7 (+18.1%), and 6.6 (+15.1%) respectively compared to the previous SOTA methods. This result demonstrates the strong cross-domain generalization capability of VLingNav.\n6.2.2\nEmbodied Visual Tracking\nTable 4:\nPerformance on embodied visual tracking.\nComparison on EVT-Bench\n[\n52\n]\n.\n†\n{\\dagger}\n: Use GroundingDINO\n[\n32\n]\nas the open-vocabulary detector.\n‡\n{\\ddagger}\n: Use SoM\n[\n61\n]\nwith GPT-4o\n[\n36\n]\nas the visual foundation model.\nMethod\nSingle Target Tracking\nDistracted Tracking\nSR\n↑\n\\uparrow\nTR\n↑\n\\uparrow\nCR\n↓\n\\downarrow\nSR\n↑\n\\uparrow\nTR\n↑\n\\uparrow\nCR\n↓\n\\downarrow\nIBVS\n†\n{\\dagger}\n[\n17\n]\n42.9\n56.2\n3.75\n10.6\n28.4\n6.14\nPoliFormer\n†\n{\\dagger}\n[\n69\n]\n4.67\n15.5\n40.1\n2.62\n13.2\n44.5\nEVT\n[\n84\n]\n24.4\n39.1\n42.5\n3.23\n11.2\n47.9\nEVT\n‡\n{\\ddagger}\n[\n84\n]\n32.5\n49.9\n40.5\n15.7\n35.7\n53.3\nUni-NaVid\n[\n75\n]\n53.3\n67.2\n12.6\n31.9\n50.1\n21.3\nTrackVLA\n[\n52\n]\n85.1\n78.6\n1.65\n57.6\n63.2\n5.80\nNavFoM\n[\n74\n]\n86.0\n80.5\n-\n61.4\n68.2\n-\nNavFoM*\n[\n74\n]\n88.4\n80.7\n-\n62.0\n67.9\n-\nTrackVLA++\n[\n30\n]\n86.0\n81.0\n2.10\n66.5\n68.8\n4.71\n\\rowcolor\ngray!20\nVLingNav (SFT)\n87.2\n78.9\n1.23\n66.1\n69.7\n4.78\n\\rowcolor\ngray!20\nVLingNav\n88.4\n81.2\n2.07\n67.6\n73.5\n5.51\nTo evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method for the Embodied Visual Tracking (EVT) task, we conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis on the EVT-Bench. Specifically, we evaluate two representative and challenging splits:\n(1)\nSingle-Target Tracking\n: The agent must continuously track a single designated target in complex unseen environments.\n(2)\nDistracted Tracking\n: A more complex scenario in which the agent must sustain stable tracking of the correct target under instructions while resisting interference from multiple distractors.\nAs illustrated in Tab.\n4\n, VLingNav demonstrates SOTA performance across both splits. In the\nSingle Target Tracking\ntask, VLingNav achieves an SR of 88.4 and a TR of 81.2, matching or slightly surpassing the previous best methods like NavFoM and TrackVLA++. In the more challenging\nDistracted Tracking\nscenario, VLingNav establishes a clear advantage, achieving an SR of 67.6 and a TR of 73.5. This represents a significant improvement of 1.1 (+1.7%) in SR and 4.7 (+6.8%) in TR compared to the previous SOTA method TrackVLA++. Notably, VLingNav outperforms NavFoM with multi-view setting while using only a monocular camera, demonstrating robust tracking and precise recognition. These results strongly validate the superior tracking capability and robustness of our approach, especially in complex environments with distractors.\nFigure 6\n:\nPerformance visualization of VLingNav across various navigation benchmarks.\n6.2.3\nImage Goal Navigation\nTable 5:\nPerformance on image goal navigation.\nComparison on HM3D Instance ImageNav benchmark\n[\n41\n]\n.

This task requires the agent to navigate to a specific object instance depicted in a goal image within complex and unseen environments. As presented in Table\n5\n, VLingNav achieves state-of-the-art results on this benchmark. It achieves an SR of 60.8, which is slightly higher than the previous SOTA method UniGoal (60.2/23.7). Note that, UniGoal leverages the LightGlue\n[\n28\n]\nkeypoint-matching algorithm as an additional criterion, whereas VLingNav relies solely on the model’s implicit reasoning. More impressively, VLingNav demonstrates a substantial improvement in navigation efficiency, achieving an SPL of 37.4. This represents a remarkable 13.7 (+57.8%) improvement over UniGoal. This significant gain in SPL underscores our model’s ability to not only successfully find the target instance but also to do so via much more direct and efficient paths, highlighting the advanced reasoning and planning abilities of VLingNav.\n6.2.4\nVisualization Results\nFig.\n6\nillustrates several visualizations of VLingNav on the simulation benchmarks, including the robot’s egocentric visual observations, a top-down scene map, input instructions, and the outputs of adaptive CoT and the predicted trajectory. These examples show that our model efficiently accomplishes multiple embodied navigation tasks while adaptively generating CoT reasoning. This not only enhances interpretability but also improves the overall quality of the navigation process.\n6.3\nReal-World Experiments\n6.3.1\nRobot Platform and Deployments\nFigure 7\n:\nReal-world robot platform setup.\nFigure 8\n:\nReal-world experiment results.\nWe provide a visualization of our robot platform in Fig.\n8\n. The platform is based on the Unitree Go2 quadruped robot, equipped with an Intel RealSense D457 camera on its head. In our work, we only utilize the RGB frames with a resolution of 1280\n×\n\\times\n800 from the camera, under a horizontal field of view (HFOV) of 90\n∘\n. Additionally, a portable Wi-Fi is mounted on the back of the robot to enable communication with the remote server through the Internet.\nVLingNav is deployed on a remote server equipped with an NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU. During real-world deployment, the server receives the instructions and images captured by the camera via the Internet. To ensure efficient communication, the images are compressed before transmission. After receiving the incoming data, the model performs inference and predicts the future trajectory, which is then transmitted to the quadruped robot for execution. Given that real-world navigation is an online process, we cache visual tokens from historically observed images. As a result, at each step the model only encodes the latest frame, which significantly improves inference efficiency. Furthermore, by leveraging VLingNav’s visual memory compression strategy, our model maintains an inference latency of under 300 ms across 500 video frames. Including communication overhead (approximately 100 ms), VLingNav achieves an effective inference speed of around 2.5 FPS during long-horizon, real-world robot experiments.\nUpon receiving the predicted trajectory, the robot employs a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) module for trajectory tracking\n[\n15\n]\n. Formulating the task as an optimization problem based on a kinematic unicycle model, the controller computes optimal linear and angular velocities over a receding horizon.\n6.3.2\nObject Goal Navigation\nWe evaluated the Object Goal Navigation performance of VLingNav against the SOTA method Uni-NaVid, across three representative scenarios: home, office, and outdoor environment.\nFor each scenario, we selected three distinct target objects: (i) the table, washing machine, and microwave for the home environment; (ii) the TV, elevator, and trashbin for the office environment; (iii) the bike, light pole, and tree for the outdoor environment.\nTo mitigate the effects of randomness, we conducted 10 repeated trials for each target object. As shown in Fig.\n8\n, VLingNav achieves a significantly higher success rate than Uni-NaVid across all tested scenarios. These results validate the robust object recognition, exploration, and cross-scenario generalization capabilities of our model.\n6.3.3\nEmbodied Visual Tracking\nWe evaluated the embodied visual tracking performance of our method against Uni-NaVid across three representative scenarios: (i) single-target tracking in open spaces, (ii) single-target tracking in cluttered indoor environments, and (iii) distracted tracking in crowded scenes with frequent occlusions and nearby distractors. To mitigate randomness, we conducted 10 repeated trials per scenario. As shown in Fig.\n8\n, our method consistently outperforms Uni-NaVid in tracking success rate, with the largest margins appearing in the distracted setting where transient occlusions and target switches are common. These results validate the effectiveness of our adaptive reasoning for re-identification after occlusion and the benefit of precise trajectory control, highlighting strong generalization to dynamic, cluttered environments.\n6.3.4\nImage Goal Navigation\nWe further evaluated Image Goal Navigation by comparing our method with UniGoal across three representative scene categories—home, office, and outdoor environments. For each category, we selected two image-specified goals and conducted 10 repeated trials per goal. As shown in Fig.\n8\n, our approach achieves a substantially higher success rate than UniGoal in all categories. These results suggest that multi-task training induces robust cross-modal grounding from text to images, while the combination of Adaptive CoT and linguistic memory supports reliable localization and efficient long-horizon navigation to visually specified targets under variations in camera intrinsics, viewpoints, and lighting.\nFigure 9\n:\nQualitative performance of VLingNav in real-world deployments.\n6.3.5\nVisualization Results\nReal-world experimental results are shown in Fig.\n9\n, where we evaluate the navigation capabilities of VLingNav under challenging scenarios. Specifically, we test the model across three representative scenario categories: office environments, household settings, and outdoor scenes. Within each category, we assess three core capabilities: object goal navigation, embodied visual tracking, and image goal navigation.\nNotably, the model weights deployed on the real-world robot are the same as those used in the simulation experiments described in the previous section; no additional fine-tuning on real-world data is performed.\nThe results demonstrate that VLingNav exhibits strong sim-to-real transfer in both recognition and planning while sustaining high-frequency inference in real-world scenarios, enabling zero-shot deployment in complex environments.\n6.4\nEmergence of Cross-Task and Cross-Domain Capabilities\nJoint training on multi-task navigation datasets leads VLingNav to exhibit emergent behaviors that generalize beyond any single task, yielding both cross-task and cross-domain capabilities.\n6.4.1\nCross-task Performance\nWe observe clear cross-task transfer in real-world experiments (Fig.\n9\n). For instance, although the visual tracking task contains only language-format instructions, VLingNav can directly track targets specified by image goals in a zero-shot manner. Moreover, it composes behaviors across tasks: (1) Search for a language-described target, then switch to tracking that target. (2) Search for the target in the image goal and subsequently track it after locating it.\nThis compositionality arises from the VLA model’s shared, unified architecture and co-training on multi-task navigation datasets. Together, these factors enable the model to learn common navigation priors and transfer them successfully across diverse navigation tasks.\n6.4.2\nCross-domain Performance\nSecond, we observe robust cross-domain generalization. Although trained only to track humans, VLingNav reliably tracks dynamic non-human targets. Moreover, VLingNav successfully localizes and navigates to out-of-distribution objectives specified only by fine-grained textual instructions, including category-ambiguous objects disambiguated by color, spatial constraints, or detailed descriptions. These behaviors indicate that multi-task learning, when co-trained with general visual understanding data, can substantially enhance VLingNav’s generalization across domains.\n6.5\nAblation Studies\nTo evaluate the contribution of each component and training strategy in VLingNav, we conducted comprehensive ablation studies. These studies were performed on the ObjectNav task using the HM3D OVON\nval unseen\nbenchmark, the EVT task using the EVT-Bench\nDistracted Tracking\nbenchmark, and the ImageNav task using the HM3D Instance ImageNav\nval\nbenchmark. For consistency, we adhered to the same training procedures and evaluation settings as those used for the full model. Below, we summarize the empirical results and analyze the key findings.\n6.5.1\nAdaptive CoT\nTable 6:\nAblation study on Chain-of-Thought strategies.\nr\nC\n​\no\n​\nT\nr_{CoT}\nindicates the average percentage of steps where CoT reasoning is activated.\nCoT Strategy\nObjNav\nTrack\nImageNav\n𝒓\n𝑪\n​\n𝒐\n​\n𝑻\n\\boldsymbol{r_{CoT}}\n(%)\nSR\n↑\n\\uparrow\nSPL\n↑\n\\uparrow\nSR\n↑\n\\uparrow\nTR\n↑\n\\uparrow\nCR\n↓\n\\downarrow\nSR\n↑\n\\uparrow\nSPL\n↑\n\\uparrow\nw/o CoT\n36.2\n16.5\n62.7\n68.5\n6.28\n56.3\n27.3\n0.0\nDense CoT (Per-step)\n25.3\n13.0\n59.8\n70.1\n26.3\n19.6\n13.2\n100.0\nFixed Interval (\nk\n=\n5\nk=5\n)\n42.5\n23.5\n68.5\n74.2\n9.18\n48.2\n28.7\n20.0\nFixed Interval (\nk\n=\n20\nk=20\n)\n39.7\n19.4\n66.2\n70.8\n11.9\n51.3\n31.2\n5.0\n\\rowcolor\ngray!20\nAdaptive CoT (Ours)\n50.1\n24.6\n67.6\n73.5\n5.51\n60.8\n37.4\n2.1\nTo assess the impact of different reasoning strategies, we conducted an ablation study detailed in Tab.\n6\n. The results show that both a complete lack of reasoning (“w/o CoT”) and exhaustive reasoning at every step (“Dense CoT”) lead to suboptimal performance. While fixed-interval reasoning provides a moderate improvement, it remains inflexible. Our proposed Adaptive CoT strategy demonstrates clear superiority. It achieves the highest performance across all benchmarks. Remarkably, it accomplishes this while maintaining an exceptionally low reasoning frequency (\nr\nC\n​\no\n​\nT\n=\n2.1\n%\nr_{CoT}=\\text{2.1}\\%\n), far more efficient than even the sparse fixed-interval method. This highlights that dynamically and intelligently activating reasoning only when needed is crucial for creating high-performing, efficient embodied agents.\n6.5.2\nVisual-assisted Linguistic Memory\nTable 7:\nAblation study on memory modalities.\nMemory Mode\nObjNav\nTrack\nImageNav\nSR\n↑\n\\uparrow\nSPL\n↑\n\\uparrow\nSR\n↑\n\\uparrow\nTR\n↑\n\\uparrow\nCR\n↓\n\\downarrow\nSR\n↑\n\\uparrow\nSPL\n↑\n\\uparrow\nw/o Memory\n15.4\n3.5\n37.5\n59.1\n1.90\n21.0\n3.7\nVisual-only\n45.2\n20.3\n66.8\n70.6\n7.85\n57.9\n33.7\nLanguage-only\n18.8\n4.4\n40.2\n55.2\n3.25\n23.3\n7.5\n\\rowcolor\ngray!20\nVLingMem (Ours)\n50.1\n24.6\n67.6\n73.5\n5.51\n60.8\n37.4\nWe conducted an ablation study to evaluate the VLingMem module and assess how long-horizon context affects navigation performance. As summarized in Tab.\n7\n, removing the memory module entirely (“w/o Memory”) leads to a substantial performance drop. This is particularly pronounced in large or multi-room layouts, where agents frequently get stuck in loops or revisit dead ends.\nUsing a naive replay buffer that stores only visual features (“Visual-only”) or only linguistic memory (“Linguistic-only”) partially recovers performance but remains inferior to our full approach.\nIn contrast, our proposed VLingMem achieves the best results with minimal latency overhead. Qualitatively, VLingMem enables the agent to remember the environment layout and avoid revisiting explored regions, yielding higher success rates with more efficient paths.\n6.5.3\nCo-train with Open-world Video Data\nTable 8:\nAblation study on open-world video co-training.\nTraining Data\nObjNav\nTrack\nImageNav\nSR\n↑\n\\uparrow\nSPL\n↑\n\\uparrow\nSR\n↑\n\\uparrow\nTR\n↑\n\\uparrow\nCR\n↓\n\\downarrow\nSR\n↑\n\\uparrow\nSPL\n↑\n\\uparrow\nw/o Co-training\n43.1\n20.6\n66.5\n70.2\n7.62\n50.2\n32.7\n\\rowcolor\ngray!20\nw/ Co-training\n50.1\n24.6\n67.6\n73.5\n5.51\n60.8\n37.4\nWe further evaluated the impact of co-training with open-world video data. As presented in Tab.\n8\n, the results demonstrate a significant performance improvement compared to the model trained solely on embodied navigation data. This co-training strategy effectively enriches the model’s semantic priors, thereby enhancing cross-modal grounding and generalization capabilities while notably reducing the sim-to-real gap.\n6.5.4\nSFT Training Steps\nWe investigated the relationship between model performance and the number of training steps. As shown in Fig.\n11\n, model performance scales positively with the number of training steps (where 1 epoch\n≈\n\\approx\n10K training steps). The success rate rises steadily as the model is exposed to more data.\nNotably, we found that excessive training leads to diminishing returns and eventual performance degradation, likely due to overfitting on the simulation data. This highlights the need for a balanced training strategy that maximizes performance without incurring unnecessary computational cost or risking overfitting.\nFigure 10\n:\nAblation study on training steps.\nFigure 11\n:\nAblation study on online post-training iteration steps.\nFigure 12\n:\nAblation study on multi-task learning. We present the multi-task synergy of VLingNav and illustrate the performance comparison between models trained on a single task and those trained on multiple tasks.\n6.5.5\nOnline Post-training\nWe evaluated the effect of our online post-training phase, which follows the SFT stage. Across all benchmarks (Tab.\n2\n,\n3\n,\n4\n,\n5\n), the post-trained VLingNav model significantly outperforms the SFT checkpoint. This phase is critical for teaching the agent to find shortcuts, recover from errors, and handle the distribution shift that occurs beyond the static demonstration data.\nAs shown in Fig.\n11\n, the ablation studies on the rollout strategy demonstrate that the proposed Hybrid Rollout exhibits the highest effectiveness, yielding the optimal performance. Here, we evaluate on the HM3D OVON\nval unseen\nsplit. While the Expert Rollout (DAgger-like) also delivers strong performance, it still exhibits a performance gap compared to the Hybrid Rollout. However, the Naive Rollout fails to improve performance, likely due to the sparse reward signals and the long-horizon nature of the task making value estimation too difficult. This confirms that our expert-guided framework successfully optimizes the policy. It uses expert data to correct faulty behaviors while simultaneously using on-policy data to explore and discover better strategies, thereby outperforming pure imitation learning and finding a more robust policy.\n6.5.6\nMulti-task Synergy\nFinally, we investigated how jointly training on ObjectNav, EVT, and ImageNav affects generalization. As shown in Fig.\n12\n, models trained on a single task consistently underperform the multi-task model, even on their respective specialized benchmarks.\nMore importantly, this multi-task training strategy fosters emergent cross-domain and cross-task capabilities, leading to a notable performance improvement on out-of-distribution tasks. These findings demonstrate that multi-task learning facilitates the transfer of skills across different domains. This synergy enhances the model’s ability to reason and plan across diverse modalities, tasks, and target categories.\n7\nDiscussion\nWe further discuss the core contributions of our approach, their broader implications, and the key insights revealed by our experimental results.\n1) Effectiveness of Adaptive Thinking:\nInspired by dual-process theory, our adaptive Chain-of-Thought (AdaCoT) mechanism autonomously allocates “cognitive resources”, balancing efficiency and deliberation. When faced with simple, unambiguous navigation scenarios, such as traversing a straight corridor, the model opts for “fast thinking” (\n<think_off>\n) and directly outputs actions, ensuring fluid and real-time navigation. Conversely, at critical decision positions, in complex environments, or when encountering ambiguity—like choosing a direction at an intersection or searching for an occluded object—the model triggers “slow thinking” (\n<think_on>\n), generating a detailed reasoning output. This adaptability not only significantly enhances decision quality but also proves that deliberate thought at a small fraction of key steps (shown to be average 2.1% in our experiments) is sufficient to substantially boost overall task success. This finding is crucial for deploying efficient, intelligent navigation on resource-constrained robot platforms.\n2) Synergy of Visual-Assisted Linguistic Memory:\nNavigation is a long-horizon decision-making process by its nature. Our proposed Visual-Assisted Linguistic Memory (VLingMem) module effectively addresses the memory deficiencies in traditional VLA models. Unlike methods that rely solely on implicit visual features, VLingMem distills key visual observations into concise linguistic summaries (\n<summary>\n⋯\n\\cdots\n</summary>\n) and integrates them into the model’s context. This design offers two primary advantages. First, linguistic memory is more robust against information decay than compressed visual features, enabling the model to clearly recall critical semantic information such as “I have already checked this room” or “there is a locked door on the left,” thereby effectively preventing redundant exploration and inefficient paths. Second, this linguistic memory forms a powerful synergy with the AdaCoT mechanism. When the model chooses not to engage in detailed CoT, the persistent linguistic memory still provides the necessary historical context, ensuring a coherent decision-making process. This synergy serves as a pivotal factor in enhancing the robustness of VLingNav in long-horizon and complex environments, while significantly improving the efficiency and quality of VLingNav’s exploration.\n3) Beyond Imitation Learning: The Value of Online Expert-guided RL:\nOur research confirms that VLA models trained exclusively via imitation learning (SFT) are constrained by both the quality and coverage of expert data. Such models are additionally prone to critical issues, including causal confusion and covariate shift. To address these limitations, we introduce a post-training phase using expert-guided reinforcement learning. VLingNav enables autonomous exploration and policy refinement through real-time online interaction with the environment, while directly deriving rewards from prior expert policy. Compared to rule-based RL, the introduction of expert knowledge allows the model to discover superior or more robust navigation strategies with higher efficiency.\nThe significant performance gains observed in our experiments underscore that RL post-training is a critical step to unlock the full potential of VLA models, transforming them from mere “imitators” into genuine “problem solvers.”\n4) Generality and Real-world Generalization:\nA notable achievement of VLingNav is its generality. By training on the large-scale, multi-task Nav-AdaCoT-2.9M dataset, VLingNav achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance across all these tasks using a single, unified set of model weights, obviating the need for task-specific fine-tuning. This demonstrates that our approach successfully captures the underlying, universal cognitive structures of embodied navigation. Even more encouraging is VLingNav’s ability to transfer to real-world robot platforms in a zero-shot manner and complete practical navigation tasks. This indicates that, through high-quality simulation training and a powerful cognitive architecture, the model learns generalizable representations of space, language, and action, rather than just patterns specific to the simulator, successfully bridging the sim-to-real gap.\nIn summary, VLingNav, with its unique cognitive architecture, provides a powerful paradigm for developing more intelligent, efficient, and interpretable embodied agents. It demonstrates the immense potential of combining principles from human cognition, such as adaptive thinking and episodic memory, with advanced machine learning paradigms like VLAs and RL.\n8\nConclusion and Limitation\nIn this work, we introduce VLingNav, a Vision-Language-Action model grounded in linguistic-driven cognition to address critical challenges in embodied navigation. By synergistically integrating adaptive reasoning, multimodal memory, and online expert-guided RL post-training, VLingNav achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of embodied navigation benchmarks and can directly transfer to real-world robot platforms in a zero-shot manner.\nWhile VLingNav has achieved progress in embodied navigation, it has several limitations that point to promising directions for future research. First, the current model primarily relies on monocular egocentric observations as input. Due to the limited field of view (FOV) inherent in monocular vision, such input constrains the model’s perceptual capabilities. Following recent work\n[\n74\n]\n, we will explore integrating multi-view observations to improve navigation efficiency. Second, the current model adopts a single-system architecture, which restricts its prediction frequency. This limitation impedes rapid decision-making and obstacle handling in highly dynamic environments. To address this, we plan to upgrade VLingNav to a dual-system structure that supports high-frequency action outputs, thereby enhancing fundamental navigation performance, such as obstacle avoidance. Finally, the current approach uses only an MPC-based waypoint controller and lacks a more flexible locomotion model\n[\n35\n]\n. Incorporating such a locomotion controller could increase movement speed and expand the robot’s reachable areas. We therefore plan to integrate locomotion capabilities into VLingNav in future work.\n9\nAcknowledgements\nWe sincerely thank Yunke Cai, Haiquan Chen, Shuai Chu, Taifeng Gao, Bo Jiang, Yunfei Li, Yunfei Liu, Tao Wang, Xibin Wu, and Tingshuai Yan for their strong support and fruitful discussions.\nReferences\nAzuma et al.

  "preview_text": "VLA models have shown promising potential in embodied navigation by unifying perception and planning while inheriting the strong generalization abilities of large VLMs. However, most existing VLA models rely on reactive mappings directly from observations to actions, lacking the explicit reasoning capabilities and persistent memory required for complex, long-horizon navigation tasks. To address these challenges, we propose VLingNav, a VLA model for embodied navigation grounded in linguistic-driven cognition. First, inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition, we introduce an adaptive chain-of-thought mechanism, which dynamically triggers explicit reasoning only when necessary, enabling the agent to fluidly switch between fast, intuitive execution and slow, deliberate planning. Second, to handle long-horizon spatial dependencies, we develop a visual-assisted linguistic memory module that constructs a persistent, cross-modal semantic memory, enabling the agent to recall past observations to prevent repetitive exploration and infer movement trends for dynamic environments. For the training recipe, we construct Nav-AdaCoT-2.9M, the largest embodied navigation dataset with reasoning annotations to date, enriched with adaptive CoT annotations that induce a reasoning paradigm capable of adjusting both when to think and what to think about. Moreover, we incorporate an online expert-guided reinforcement learning stage, enabling the model to surpass pure imitation learning and to acquire more robust, self-explored navigation behaviors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VLingNav achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of embodied navigation benchmarks. Notably, VLingNav transfers to real-world robotic platforms in a zero-shot manner, executing various navigation tasks and demonstrating strong cross-domain and cross-task generalization.\n\n1]ByteDance Seed\n2]Peking University\n3]Zhongguancun Academy\n\\contribution\n[*]Co-first authors\n\\contribution\n",

      "answer": "## VLingNav 的前作分析\n\nVLingNav 的研究团队（主要来自字节跳动和北京大学）在视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型和具身导航领域有一系列相关的前期工作。这些工作为 VLingNav 的提出奠定了基础。以下表格详细梳理了其核心前作，并重点对比了 VLingNav 与这些前作在技术路线和具体改进上的区别。\n\n| 论文名称 | 发表年份/状态 | 核心贡献与技术特点 | 与 VLingNav 的主要区别及 VLingNav 的改进 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **NaVid** (Video-based VLM Plans the Next Step for Vision-and-Language Navigation) | 2024 (RSS) | **首个基于视频的VLA导航模型**。将导航任务构建为视频问答问题，使用视频VLM（LLaVA-Video）作为主干，通过监督微调（SFT）学习从视觉观察和语言指令到离散动作（如“前进”、“左转”）的映射。展现了强大的零样本泛化能力。 | **区别与改进**：<br>1. **推理机制**：NaVid 是**反应式**模型，缺乏显式的、可解释的推理过程。VLingNav 引入了**自适应思维链（AdaCoT）**，使模型具备动态触发显式推理的能力，提升了决策的可靠性和可解释性。<br>2. **记忆机制**：NaVid 仅通过输入历史视频帧提供**隐式视觉记忆**，信息易衰减。VLingNav 设计了**视觉辅助语言记忆（VLingMem）**，构建了持久、可回顾的跨模态语义记忆，有效防止重复探索。<br>3. **动作输出**：NaVid 输出**离散动作令牌**，控制精度和流畅性有限。VLingNav 通过MLP动作模型直接输出**连续轨迹**，控制更精细、适应动态场景能力更强。<br>4. **训练范式**：NaVid 仅使用**模仿学习（SFT）**。VLingNav 增加了**在线专家引导的强化学习（RL）后训练**阶段，使策略能超越演示数据，自我优化，获得更鲁棒的行为。 |\n| **Uni-NaVid** (A Video-based Vision-Language-Action Model for Unifying Embodied Navigation Tasks) | 2025 (RSS) | **多任务统一的VLA导航模型**。在NaVid基础上，引入了**视频流压缩机制**以控制视觉令牌数量，提升了推理效率。同时，将模型扩展到物体导航（ObjNav）、图像目标导航（ImageNav）和视觉跟踪（EVT）等多个任务，使用单一模型实现SOTA性能。 | **区别与改进**：<br>1. **自适应推理**：Uni-NaVid 虽然支持多任务，但其推理过程仍是固定的或需要手动配置频率。VLingNav 的 **AdaCoT 是自适应的**，模型能自主决定“何时思考”以及“思考什么”，在效率与性能间取得更好平衡（平均仅2.1%的步骤触发详细推理）。<br>2. **结构化记忆**：Uni-NaVid 的记忆仍依赖于压缩后的历史视觉特征，是隐式的。VLingNav 的 **VLingMem 是显式、结构化的语言记忆**，能主动总结环境关键信息（`<summary>`），并与推理过程协同，长期规划能力更强。<br>3. **训练数据与策略**：Uni-NaVid 主要依赖现有导航数据集进行SFT。VLingNav 构建了**迄今最大的带推理标注的数据集 Nav-AdaCoT-2.9M**，并引入了**RL后训练**，使其在复杂、长视野任务（如MP3D ObjNav）上表现显著更优（SR提升显著）。 |\n| **TrackVLA** (Embodied Visual Tracking in the Wild) | 2025 (arXiv) | **专注于具身视觉跟踪（EVT）的VLA模型**。设计了**基于锚点的扩散策略**，直接输出机器人的运动轨迹，相比离散动作在跟踪平滑性和精度上有大幅提升。在EVT-Bench上取得了当时SOTA的结果。 | **区别与改进**：<br>1. **通用性与架构**：TrackVLA 是**专门为跟踪任务设计**的模型。VLingNav 是一个**通用导航框架**，通过多任务协同训练，在ObjNav、ImageNav和EVT任务上均达到SOTA，实现了“一个模型解决多个问题”。<br>2. **推理与记忆**：TrackVLA 未强调显式推理和长期记忆模块。VLingNav 引入了**AdaCoT和VLingMem这两个核心认知模块**，使其在复杂干扰场景（如Distracted Tracking）中表现更鲁棒，能更好地进行重识别和轨迹规划。<br>3. **动作模型**：TrackVLA 使用**扩散模型**生成轨迹，推理时需要迭代去噪，计算开销较大。VLingNav 采用**轻量化的MLP动作模型**（输出高斯分布参数），在保证连续控制精度的同时，实现了**更高的推理效率**（~300ms延迟），更利于实时机器人部署。 |\n| **NavFoM** (Embodied Navigation Foundation Model) | 2025 (arXiv) | **导航基础模型**。引入了**TVI（Time, View, Instance）令牌**，能够融合来自不同机器人形态（ embodiment ）的跨视角导航数据，增强了模型的泛化性和空间理解能力。 | **区别与改进**：<br>1. **认知机制设计**：NavFoM 侧重于**数据融合与表征学习**。VLingNav 的核心创新在于**模仿人类认知过程的架构设计**（双过程推理+语言记忆），旨在提升模型的内在决策能力和可解释性。<br>2. **记忆形式**：NavFoM 可能利用多视角信息构建更丰富的场景表示，但未明确设计持久记忆模块。VLingNav 明确提出了**VLingMem**，以语言为中心构建记忆，与VLM主干天然对齐，更专注于利用历史信息指导未来决策。<br>3. **训练策略**：VLingNav 强调了**RL后训练**的关键作用，实验表明其能显著提升SFT基线的性能。而NavFoM 的工作重点更多在预训练和数据层面。 |\n\n### 总结：VLingNav 的核心改进\n\nVLingNav 并非对前作功能的简单叠加，而是在**认知架构**和**训练范式**上进行了根本性的革新：\n\n1.  **从反应式到认知式**：前作（NaVid, Uni-NaVid）本质是强大的“感知-动作”映射器。VLingNav 通过 **AdaCoT** 赋予了模型“思考”的能力，实现了**动态的、按需的显式推理**，这是从“条件反射”到“深思熟虑”的关键跨越。\n\n2.  **从隐式记忆到显式记忆**：前作依赖历史视觉输入作为隐式记忆。VLingNav 的 **VLingMem** 创建了以语言为载体的、可存储和调用的显式语义记忆，解决了长视野任务中的信息遗忘和循环探索问题。\n\n3.  **从纯模仿到交互学习**：前作主要依赖专家演示（SFT）。VLingNav 引入了**在线专家引导的RL**，使模型能够通过与环境的主动交互来发现更优策略、纠正错误，突破了模仿学习的数据瓶颈和协变量偏移问题。\n\n4.  **从专用模型到通用且高效的智能体**：VLingNav 整合了上述改进，在一个框架内统一了多个导航任务，并兼顾了高性能（各项任务SOTA）与高效率（低推理频率、快速连续动作预测），最终实现了**零样本迁移到真实机器人**，完成了从仿真算法到实用系统的验证。\n\n**总而言之，VLingNav 的主要改善在于将认知科学原理（双过程理论、语言记忆）系统性地融入VLA模型架构，并通过创新的数据集构建和两阶段训练策略（SFT+RL），打造出一个具备自适应推理、持久记忆和强泛化能力的“认知型”具身导航智能体。**",
