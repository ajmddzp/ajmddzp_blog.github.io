Existing approaches typically depend on large, hardware-specific grasp datasets collected in simulation or through costly real-world trials, hindering scalability as new dexterous hand designs emerge. To this end, we propose a data-efficient framework, which is designed to bypass robot grasp data collection by exploiting the rich, object-centric semantic priors latent in pretrained generative diffusion models. Temporally aligned and fine-grained grasp affordances are extracted from raw human video demonstrations and fused with 3D scene geometry from depth images to infer semantically grounded contact targets. A kinematics-aware retargeting module then maps these affordance representations to diverse dexterous hands without per-hand retraining. The resulting system produces stable, functionally appropriate multi-contact grasps that remain reliably successful across common objects and tools, while exhibiting strong generalization across previously unseen object instances within a category, pose variations, and multiple hand embodiments. This work (i) introduces a semantic affordance extraction pipeline leveraging vision–language generative priors for dexterous grasping, (ii) demonstrates cross-hand generalization without constructing hardware-specific grasp datasets, and (iii) establishes that a single depth modality suffices for high-performance grasp synthesis when coupled with foundation-model semantics. Our results highlight a path toward scalable, hardware-agnostic dexterous manipulation driven by human demonstrations and pretrained generative models.\nI\nIntroduction\nReliable grasp synthesis remains a central, yet unresolved, challenge in dexterous robot manipulation. Compared with parallel-jaw grippers, multi-fingered dexterous hands offer substantially higher kinematic expressivity and potential contact richness, but this increase in dimensionality and hand–object–environment interaction complexity dramatically amplifies the difficulty of learning and deploying robust grasp strategies. The classical problem can be informally factorized into (i) “\nhow to grasp\n”: the structured, role-aware coordination of fingers, contacts, approach direction, and hand synergies, and (ii) “\nwhere to grasp\n”: the spatial localization of functionally exploitable object regions. Despite rapid progress, existing methods typically address these two issues in isolation, leading to brittle policies, embodiment entanglement, and limited cross-object generalization.\nOn “\nhow\nto grasp”, recent works leverage reinforcement learning or large-scale supervised training in simulation to explore expansive action spaces\n[\n36\n,\n34\n]\n. However, simulation-trained policies customarily rely on privileged, complete, and noise-free geometric states, which are rarely attainable in real-world deployments. This induces significant sim-to-real gaps when facing realistic sensing artifacts such as partial views, self-occlusions, depth discontinuities, and modality noise.\nAn alternative line—direct large-scale real-world data collection (e.g., AnyDexGrasp\n[\n9\n]\n)—suffers from prohibitive operational cost and still struggles to generalize to unseen dexterous hand embodiments. A core culprit is representational overfitting: action/policy parameterizations are tightly coupled to a specific hand model’s joint layout, contact affordances, and actuation limits, precluding systematic transfer.\nOn “\nwhere\nto grasp”, prevailing affordance research yields coarse region-of-interest predictions\n[\n23\n,\n22\n]\n. While such representations offer a spatial prior for potential contact regions, they stop short of encoding the per-finger engagement strategy and the geometry-conditioned sequencing necessary for stable multi-contact closure.\nThus, although they identify candidate regions, they fail to specify the fine-grained per-finger instructions required for dexterous manipulation (e.g., contact assignments, approach vectors, and local-geometry adaptations). Recasting contact reasoning as keypoint detection is likewise insufficient: reliable contact loci often lack discriminative RGB cues and hinge on object-part semantics and inter-finger relations that appearance-only backbones (e.g., CNNs/ViTs\n[\n8\n]\n) do not capture.\nOur core idea to tackle the above challenges is that Internet-scale text-to-image diffusion models internalize multi-level knowledge about objects, parts, materials, and functional geometry\n[\n29\n]\n. Prior work\n[\n38\n]\nshows that intermediate denoising features encode exactly the semantic priors missing in standard discriminative backbones, and that these features can be repurposed—not to generate data, but to ground grasp semantics.\nBuilding on this insight, we propose to infer a\nFinger-Specific Affordance Field (FSAF)\nthat unifies the “how” and “where”: a dense, object-conditioned mapping that assigns, for each prospective surface location, structured likelihoods and role descriptors for individual fingers, jointly capturing feasible contact placement, approach direction hypotheses, and inter-finger relational compatibility.\nSpecifically, we repurpose a frozen Stable Diffusion\n[\n29\n]\nU\n-\nNet as a semantic backbone to infer a\nFSAF and couple it with a kinematics\n-\naware planner for on\n-\ntable execution. Once FSAF is inferred, we compose novel grasps without additional teleoperation and transfer across heterogeneous dexterous hands via object\n-\ncentric planning.\nThis affordance-based representation enables more precise manipulation from only a small number of human demonstrations and supports deploying a single policy across multiple dexterous hands.\nExperiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on seen and unseen objects—superior affordance grounding and a 90% grasp success rate—with cross-embodiment transfer to different dexterous hands.\nIn summary, we make the following contributions:\n•\nFinger-Specific Affordance Field (FSAF).\nWe introduce a fine-grained, per-finger affordance representation that leverages vision–language generative priors to jointly encode object affordance functions and contact-level manipulation semantics, decomposing monolithic grasp poses into semantically grounded finger role assignments.\n•\nDemonstration-light, affordance-conditioned grasp synthesis.\nOur grasp generation consumes the inferred FSAF to synthesize stable, role-constrained multi-finger grasp configurations without requiring large-scale teleoperation demonstration corpora, substantially reducing data collection burden.\n•\nCross-embodiment generalization.\nWe achieve direct transfer of grasp strategies across heterogeneous dexterous hands, evidencing that the proposed affordance abstraction disentangles grasp semantics from specific embodiment kinematics.\nII\nRELATED WORK\nII-A\nLearning from Human Demonstration Videos\nLearning from human demonstration videos is central to robot learning because such data are easier to collect and encode strong task priors\n[\n22\n,\n28\n]\n; however, a persistent embodiment gap separates human hands from robotic dexterous end-effectors. The prevailing remedy is retargeting—mapping human motions to robot kinematics\n[\n25\n,\n43\n,\n18\n]\n—which is effective for teleoperation and data gathering but typically still requires reinforcement learning in simulation to attain dexterous proficiency, thereby introducing a sim-to-real gap and limiting cross-embodiment generalization. Recently, a more fundamental route is to learn manipulation structure from human hand data that robots can directly consume. For parallel-jaw grippers, PointPolicy\n[\n13\n]\nuses video-derived keypoints to supervise gripper control; however, such position-only cues under-specify dexterous-hand interaction. In this work, we therefore learn finger-specific affordances from human demonstrations—object-conditioned descriptors that specify, per finger, contactable regions and approach directions over time—to represent how dexterous hands should interact with objects.\nFigure 2\n:\nPipeline overview.\n(1)\nHyperfeature extraction:\nA frozen text-to-image diffusion U-Net encodes the object image with text conditioning.

Such position-only cues under-specify dexterous-hand interactions\n[\n31\n,\n7\n]\n. In addition, a subset of dexterous hand approaches relies on template matching, built around exemplars specific to the object or the task, thus having limited generalizability to novel objects/tasks\n[\n17\n,\n10\n]\n. Contact-centric representations improve task relevance but require complex pipelines and costly data collection to obtain dexterous-hand contact regions\n[\n39\n,\n4\n]\n. More recently, interaction-driven approaches such as CMKA\n[\n37\n]\nlearn interaction regions from web imagery, yet map object keypoints to wrist, index, and little-finger anchors, effectively producing a single grasp parameterized by three points and limiting performance to on-shelf settings. These limitations motivate per-finger contact representations rather than region- or point-only cues.\nWe learn per-finger contact cues and, via depth-and-segmentation projection, map them onto object surfaces, to further derive precise tabletop grasps.\nII-C\nAffordance Learning\nThe concept of affordance was popularized by psychologist James Gibson\n[\n12\n]\n,\nwhich aims to highlight the actionable areas on objects, is crucial for robotic grasping and manipulation in dynamic, complex, and physical environments. Previous research has achieved remarkable progress in learning affordance knowledge from Human-Object-Interaction (HOI) images\n[\n40\n,\n30\n]\nand videos\n[\n1\n,\n23\n]\n, language instructions\n[\n19\n]\n, and 3D point clouds\n[\n6\n,\n5\n]\n. More recently, researchers have expanded the reasoning ability of multimodal large language models into affordance learning\n[\n33\n,\n24\n]\n, achieving advanced affordance reasoning and generalization abilities. Moreover, the text-to-image diffusion model\n[\n29\n]\nshows promising affordance-aware understanding ability by generating precise hand-object images\n[\n38\n]\n.\nHowever, most approaches localize coarse object regions (e.g., boxes or masks), which is insufficient for fine-grained, finger-specific guidance required by dexterous hands—motivating representations at the per-finger contact level.\nIII\nMETHODS\nWe present a perception-to-optimization framework that learns\nfinger-specific affordances\nfrom human demonstrations and converts them into executable dexterous grasps, as shown in Fig.\n2\n. Semantically grounded hyperfeatures from a frozen text-to-image diffusion model\n[\n29\n]\nare decoded into five-channel per-finger likelihood maps, which guide contact selection on a reconstructed object point cloud. Local surface geometry defines waypointed approach/closure trajectories that are tracked via a damped least-squares QP under joint and collision constraints. As grasp execution is optimization-based, the pipeline transfers across dexterous hands with little or no retraining.\nIII-A\nData Collection\nWe construct a finger-wise contact affordance dataset from human demonstration videos using a custom data acquisition pipeline. For each recorded grasp sequence, we first automatically detect 2D hand keypoints with the RTMPose\n[\n15\n]\nhand pose estimator. We then identify (i) an\nobject-only\nkeyframe in which the target object is fully visible and no hand pixels are present, and (ii) the earliest\nstable grasp\nframe in which the human hand establishes clear contact with the object. This pair of frames form one training sample: the object-only frame provides a clean visual context of the object’s geometry and texture, while the grasp frame provides the supervisory signal for finger-specific contact localization.\nOn the image lattice\nΩ\n=\n{\n0\n,\n…\n,\nh\n−\n1\n}\n×\n{\n0\n,\n…\n,\nw\n−\n1\n}\n\\Omega=\\{0,\\ldots,h-1\\}\\times\\{0,\\ldots,w-1\\}\n, each fingertip\nk\nk\nwith center\nμ\nk\n\\mu_{k}\ninduces a Gaussian channel\nH\nk\n​\n(\nu\n)\n=\nexp\n⁡\n(\n−\n‖\nu\n−\nμ\nk\n‖\n2\n2\n/\n(\n2\n​\nσ\n2\n)\n)\nH_{k}(u)=\\exp(-\\|u-\\mu_{k}\\|_{2}^{2}/(2\\sigma^{2}))\nfor\nu\n∈\nΩ\nu\\in\\Omega\n; stacking yields a tensor\nH\nH\nof shape\n5\n×\nh\n×\nw\n5\\times h\\times w\n.\nWe set\nσ\n=\nmin\n⁡\n(\nh\n,\nw\n)\n/\n64\n\\sigma=\\min(h,w)/64\nand train the predictor\nH\n^\n\\hat{H}\nto regress\nH\nH\nusing MSE.\nIII-B\nFinger-Specific Affordance Representation from Diffusion Models\nIII-B\n1\nFeature synthesis and hyperfeature aggregation\nEmpirical evidence that diffusion models generate precise hand–object grasp\n[\n38\n]\nscenarios indicates that Stable Diffusion\n[\n29\n]\nhas already acquired the grasp-critical feature space, integrating holistic affordance semantics with nuanced image details via its generative learning process. Inspired by prior work\n[\n38\n,\n21\n]\n, we leverage the rich semantic grounding capability of large pretrained text-to-image diffusion models to localize finger-specific contact affordances on object images. Distinct from previous approaches, we jointly harvest both visual and textual affordance semantics from Stable Diffusion. Roughly speaking, we employ a U-Net backbone comprising convolutional blocks, downsampling / upsampling paths, skip connections, and cross-attention modules. At each denoising timestep, cross-attention injects textual embeddings into the visual feature stream, encouraging intermediate activations to align with interpretable semantic concepts.

We deliberately eschew any learned policy so that the method can be ported across distinct dexterous hand embodiments without model modification or retraining; adopting a pure motion-planning and optimization formulation preserves cross-embodiment generality. Our perception pipeline reconstructs a partial object point cloud by first generating a dense depth map from stereo infrared (IR) using the FoundationStereo\n[\n35\n]\n. The target object mask, segmented by GroundingDINO-SAM2\n[\n20\n,\n27\n]\n, is then back-projected using camera intrinsics to yield the final 3D point cloud. Using the finger keypoints obtained in Section\nIII-B\n, we first re‑project the entire 3D point cloud onto the image plane. Then, for each finger keypoint, we use the previously described method to select the N point‑cloud projections that are closest to it in the image, forming robust fingertip contact candidates.\nApproach Vector Construction:\nGiven the predicted per-finger contact locations\nc\nk\nc_{k}\n, we estimate a consistent surface normal\nn\n^\nk\n\\hat{n}_{k}\nby fitting a local tangent plane to the object point cloud and resolving its orientation with an object-centric rule (normal oriented toward the contact patch). We then parameterize a short, geometry-aligned 1D approach vector for each finger:\nγ\nk\n​\n(\ns\n)\n=\nc\nk\n+\ns\n​\nn\n^\nk\n,\ns\n∈\nℝ\n,\n\\gamma_{k}(s)=c_{k}+s\\,\\hat{n}_{k},\\qquad s\\in\\mathbb{R},\n(6)\nand instantiate three phase anchors along this curve:\napproach\n(\ns\n>\n0\ns>0\n),\nclosure\n(\ns\n→\n0\n+\ns\\to 0^{+}\n), and\nhold\n(\ns\n<\n0\ns<0\n, introducing a small preload).

For evaluation, we test on seven\nunseen\nobjects that include both (i) new instances of previously seen categories and (ii) entirely novel categories (e.g., wrench, hammer).\nFigure 5\n:\nQualitative comparison of finger-specific affordance grounding.\nLeft:\nSeen\nobjects; Right:\nUnseen\nobjects. Rows show ReKep, CMKA, Ours (DINO features), and Ours (Stable Diffusion). Overlays visualize five per-finger likelihood maps; colored dots indicate annotated fingertip contacts. The diffusion-based variant produces sharper, finger-disentangled hotspots aligned with functional parts and preserves localization quality on unseen tools. ReKep and CMKA each produce keypoints directly and a single-channel heatmap is generated via post-processing following CMKA, thus their overlays are rendered in a single purple color, whereas our method outputs five-channel heatmaps rendered with five distinct colors.\nImplementation Details:\nWe train for\n4\n,\n000\n4{,}000\nsteps with batch size\n2\n2\non a single NVIDIA H100 GPU using AdamW (initial learning rate\n10\n−\n3\n10^{-3}\nwith cosine decay). Raw RGB frames are resized to\n640\n×\n320\n640\\times 320\nwith letterboxing when necessary to preserve aspect ratio, and pixel intensities are normalized to\n[\n0\n,\n1\n]\n[0,1]\n. Predicted and ground-truth finger heatmaps are uniformly rescaled to\n448\n×\n448\n448\\times 448\nfollowing saliency-grounding conventions, and each per-finger heatmap is re-normalized to integrate to\n1\n1\n.\nAll results are averaged over 3 random seeds.\nThe robotic arm–dexterous-hand platform is shown in Fig.\n4\n; the real-world setup comprises two dexterous hands (DexHand021 and Linker Hand L20), a Franka arm, and a RealSense 435 camera.\nEvaluation Metrics:\nFor finger-specific affordance grounding, We report KLD, SIM, and NSS\n[\n2\n]\n:\n•\nKLD\n(lower is better): Kullback–Leibler divergence between predicted and ground-truth heatmaps.\n•\nSIM\n(higher is better): Normalized histogram intersection (similarity).\n•\nNSS\n(higher is better): Normalized Scanpath Saliency; per finger we sample the annotated keypoint location as a fixation.\nFor Dexterous functional grasping, we follow the definitions of metrics provided\nin [4] and [5]:\nGrasping Success Rate (Suc. R.)\n: A grasp is considered\nsuccessful if the object can be lifted above 0.1 m and\nheld stable longer than 3 seconds. Here, grasping specifically refers to grasping based on manipulation affordances.\nIV-B\nResults of Finger-Specific Affordance Grounding\nBecause there is no prior work that directly couples vision-language models with fine-grained, finger-specific affordance keypoints, we select two closest approaches as baselines. (1) Rekep\n[\n14\n]\nis a robotic manipulation keypoint prediction framework that extracts image features using DINO and obtains keypoints via unsupervised clustering. (2) CMKA\n[\n37\n]\nleverages exocentric (third-person) interaction images as input, applies SAM\n[\n16\n]\nfor multi-scale object segmentation, and then performs clustering over the segmentation-driven feature hierarchy to learn object affordance keypoints.\nTo ensure fairness, we train CMKA\n[\n37\n]\nusing the exocentric interaction images from our dataset, keeping all other hyperparameters unchanged. For metric computation, we follow a procedure consistent with CMKA: the predicted keypoints are first rescaled to the original image resolution, then converted into heatmaps by placing Gaussian kernels (with\nσ\n\\sigma\nset to shorter side of image size / 64) centered at each keypoint. To validate the necessity of large-scale generative models in our framework, we conduct ablations that replace the diffusion\n-\nderived hyperfeatures with discriminative backbones CLIP\n[\n26\n]\nand DINO\n[\n3\n]\nused purely as feature extractors.\nTABLE I\n:\nComparison and ablation on the finger-specific affordance grounding benchmark.

Fig.\n5\n(left,\nseen\n) and (right,\nunseen\n) qualitatively reveal these failure cases where on objects with weak or uniform appearance cue, e.g., the smooth, texture-poor\ntomato\nand the monochrome\nmouse\n, both baselines produce diffuse, centroid-biased blobs and scattered contact dots that either bleed across boundaries or miss functional parts. Our model simultaneously improves all three metrics—lower KLD and higher SIM/NSS—indicating more precise localization of affordance-relevant regions rather than generic centers or silhouette edges.\nHolding data, labels, losses, and training schedule fixed while varying only the feature extractor, we isolate the contribution of diffusion-derived hyperfeatures.\nKLD\nincreases by\n1.33\n×\n1.33\\times\ncompared with DINO and\n2.69\n×\n2.69\\times\nwith CLIP, while\nSIM\ndrops by\n14.2\n%\n14.2\\%\n/\n35.6\n%\n35.6\\%\nand\nNSS\nby\n9.1\n%\n9.1\\%\n/\n30.9\n%\n30.9\\%\n.\nOurs (DINO) tends to merge adjacent fingers into single peaks and produces broader activations with boundary spill-over. Besides, on\nunseen\nelongated tools (e.g.,\nhammer\n), it allocates excess activation to the visually salient head rather than the grasp-functional handle. In contrast, our diffusion-based model maintains sharp, part-aligned peaks along the handle and places stabilizing secondary contacts on supporting faces. Across both seen and unseen items (e.g.,\nscrewdriver\n,\nwrench\n,\nbottle\n), diffusion hyperfeatures consistently suppress three dominant errors, i.e., centroid collapse, boundary spill-over, and fingertip swapping, supporting\nRQ1\nthat diffusion-derived hyperfeatures are critical for precise per-finger affordance localization.\nIV-C\nFunctional Affordance Grasping with High-DOF Hands\nOur evaluation targets\non-table\n, affordance-driven dexterous grasping with finger-specific contacts and human-consistent grasp sites.\nExisting simulation-trained policies\n[\n36\n]\noptimize for success in simplified settings and cannot select grasp sites following human conventions (e.g., grasping a hammer by its head).\nTo assess alignment with human grasp choices within our setting, we include two point-cloud-based imitation learning policies (Diffusion Policy 3D\n[\n42\n]\nand ACT-3D\n[\n11\n]\n) trained from our teleoperated demonstrations(30 trajectories). We also compare to CMKA representing a recent affordance-based dexterous grasping approach. We evaluate CMKA strictly under its original, unmodified pipeline: we directly use the three keypoints predicted by CMKA, lift them to 3D, assign them to the functional finger, little finger, and wrist, and then execute the method’s fixed grasp execution strategy.\nAs shown in Tab.\nII\n, the conventional imitation-learning baselines tend to reproduce trajectories close to demonstrations: as object morphology varies, they do not proactively adapt their strategy, leading to significantly degraded performance both on seen objects with poses absent from the training data and on unseen objects. CMKA’s performance is limited by the layered segmentation output of SAM; as discussed in Section\nII-B\n, for objects that lack salient part delineation such as tomatoes and bananas, it often fails to predict correct grasp locations. Moreover, because it executes a preprogrammed grasp approaching motion, the fingers collide with the table surface when attempting to grasp low-profile objects such as bananas and screwdrivers, thus preventing successful task completion.\nBy contrast, our method achieves higher success on common objects and remains robust on previously unseen instances within the same categories. In Fig.\n6\n, per-finger affordance inference places contacts on grasp-functional geometry, while robust stereo depth estimation provides stable surface normals for accurate on-table execution. The geometry-aligned\nApproach Vector\nco-optimizes wrist pose and finger trajectories relative to the tabletop object, producing table-skimming entries that reliably avoid finger–table collisions, particularly beneficial for low-profile objects.\nFigure 6\n:\nAffordance-driven dexterous grasping in the real world.\nRepresentative rollouts on everyday objects and tools; columns denote tasks (banana, bottle, tomato, screwdriver, drill).\nTABLE II\n:\nPerformance comparison across different methods on common objects and tools manipulation tasks.

We transfer the pipeline from DexHand021 (\n12\n+\n5\n12{+}5\nDOFs) to Linker Hand L20 (\n16\n+\n5\n16{+}5\nDOFs) via\nkinematic retargeting of fingertip targets; perception and affordance inference remain unchanged.\nAs shown in Tab.\nIII\n, grasp success remains statistically unchanged across embodiments.\nThis invariance indicates that the proposed finger-specific affordance representation and geometry-aligned waypoint construction decouple grasp semantics from hand morphology, enabling deployment without hand-specific retraining.\nTABLE III\n:\nGrasp success rates across different hand embodiments.\nCommon Objects (%)\nTools (%)\nModel\nBottle (S/U)\nBanana\nTomato\nScrewdriver\nDrill\nDexHand021\n100/85\n85\n90\n60\n70\nLinker Hand L20\n100/80\n90\n100\n70\n90\nV\nCONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nWe leverage pretrained generative models’ understanding of hand–object interactions to extract both high-level object semantics and fine-grained visual cues, and fuse these with a small set of human demonstrations providing fingertip annotations. This enables learning\nfinger-specific affordances\nthat unify perception and control: our representation captures not only\nwhere\nto act but also\nhow\nto act. Built on this, our FSAG-based motion planning maps dexterous-hand postures onto finger-specific contacts, yielding stable functional grasps and generalization across multiple dexterous-hand embodiments. Empirically, our approach substantially outperforms contemporary methods on both affordance localization accuracy and functional grasping success rate.\nAs illustrated in Fig.\n7\n, occasional failures on slender objects arise primarily from the execution: a simple, fixed-offset open-loop closure can induce rotation or slip even when contact targets are valid.\nNext, we will close the loop around FSAF contacts via learned residual-impedance/operational-space control with contact-force estimation and slip detection, yielding more robust and dynamic manipulation.\nReferences\n[1]\nS.

    "preview_text": "Dexterous grasp synthesis remains a central challenge: the high dimensionality and kinematic diversity of multi-fingered hands prevent direct transfer of algorithms developed for parallel-jaw grippers. Existing approaches typically depend on large, hardware-specific grasp datasets collected in simulation or through costly real-world trials, hindering scalability as new dexterous hand designs emerge. To this end, we propose a data-efficient framework, which is designed to bypass robot grasp data collection by exploiting the rich, object-centric semantic priors latent in pretrained generative diffusion models. Temporally aligned and fine-grained grasp affordances are extracted from raw human video demonstrations and fused with 3D scene geometry from depth images to infer semantically grounded contact targets. A kinematics-aware retargeting module then maps these affordance representations to diverse dexterous hands without per-hand retraining. The resulting system produces stable, functionally appropriate multi-contact grasps that remain reliably successful across common objects and tools, while exhibiting strong generalization across previously unseen object instances within a category, pose variations, and multiple hand embodiments. This work (i) introduces a semantic affordance extraction pipeline leveraging vision-language generative priors for dexterous grasping, (ii) demonstrates cross-hand generalization without constructing hardware-specific grasp datasets, and (iii) establishes that a single depth modality suffices for high-performance grasp synthesis when coupled with foundation-model semantics. Our results highlight a path toward scalable, hardware-agnostic dexterous manipulation driven by human demonstrations and pretrained generative models.\n\nFSAG: Enhancing Human-to-Dexterous-Hand Finger-Specific Affordance Grounding via Diffusion Models\nYifan Han\n1,2\n,\nPengfei Yi\n1,2\n,\nJunyan Li\n1,2\n,\nHanqing Wang\n3\n,\nGaojing Zhang\n4\n,\nQi Peng Liu\n5\n,\nWenzhao Lian\n5†\n1\n",

            "answer": "## 论文核心分析：FSAG\n\n### **一、 核心问题**\n论文旨在解决**灵巧手抓取合成**中的两大核心挑战：\n1.  **“如何抓”与“何处抓”的割裂**：现有方法通常将抓取策略（手指协调、接触点、接近方向）与抓取位置（功能化可操作区域）分开处理，导致策略脆弱、泛化能力差。\n2.  **数据依赖与硬件耦合**：传统方法严重依赖在仿真或真实世界中收集的、针对特定灵巧手硬件的大规模抓取数据集。这导致成本高昂，且难以推广到新设计的灵巧手上，**可扩展性差**。\n\n### **二、 核心创新点**\n论文提出了一个名为 **FSAG** 的数据高效框架，其核心创新在于：\n\n1.  **提出“手指特定可供性场”（Finger-Specific Affordance Field, FSAF）**\n    -   **是什么**：一种细粒度的、**以对象为中心**的密集映射表示。它为物体表面的每个潜在位置，不仅预测其是否“可抓取”，更关键的是**为每个手指（五指）分配结构化的似然值和角色描述符**。\n    -   **解决了什么**：统一了“如何抓”与“何处抓”。FSAF 同时编码了可行的接触点放置、接近方向假设以及手指间的协同关系，将整体的抓取姿态分解为**基于语义的手指角色分配**。\n\n2.  **利用预训练扩散模型的语义先验，实现数据高效学习**\n    -   **关键技术**：**重用冻结的 Stable Diffusion U-Net 作为语义骨干网络**，提取其去噪过程中的多尺度、多时间步特征（称为“超特征”），这些特征编码了关于物体、部件、材料和功能几何的丰富知识。\n    -   **解决了什么**：**绕过昂贵的机器人抓取数据收集**。仅需少量（论文中为130个）带指尖标注的人类抓取演示视频，即可学习到高质量的 FSAF。这大幅降低了数据负担。\n\n3.  **实现跨具身（Cross-Embodiment）泛化**\n    -   **方法**：采用**基于优化的运动规划**（阻尼最小二乘二次规划，QP）来执行抓取。感知模块（FSAF预测）与规划模块解耦。规划器仅接收从FSAF和深度图像中推导出的**几何对齐的接触点目标与接近路径**，而不依赖于特定手的运动学模型。\n    -   **解决了什么**：**将抓取语义与特定硬件运动学解耦**。使得学习到的抓取策略能够**零样本（zero-shot）** 迁移到不同的灵巧手（如DexHand021和Linker Hand L20）上，无需针对每款手重新训练。\n\n### **三、 解决方案（技术流程）**\n整个系统是一个从感知到优化的端到端管道：\n\n1.  **数据收集与标注**：从人类抓取视频中，自动检测手部关键点，生成五指指尖的2D高斯热图作为监督信号。\n2.  **FSAF预测（核心感知模块）**：\n    -   **特征提取**：输入物体RGB图像和文本描述，通过冻结的扩散U-Net提取多尺度“超特征” `Ag`。\n    -   **热图解码**：使用一个FPN风格的解码器，将 `Ag` 上采样并解码为 **5通道的、每手指的似然热图** `H_hat`。\n3.  **3D场景重建**：结合深度图像（FoundationStereo）和物体分割（GroundingDINO-SAM2），生成物体的**部分点云**。\n4.  **抓取规划与执行**：\n    -   **接触点选择**：将预测的2D指尖热图峰值反投影到3D点云上，作为候选接触点。\n    -   **路径生成**：根据接触点处的局部表面法线，为每个手指构建一条分为 **“接近-闭合-保持”三阶段**的几何对齐路径。\n    -   **优化控制**：使用一个**阻尼最小二乘QP求解器**，在满足关节限位、碰撞避免等约束的条件下，跟踪所有手指的阶段路径点，生成可执行的关节控制指令。\n\n### **四、 实际价值与意义**\n-   **数据高效与低成本**：显著减少对大规模、硬件特定机器人数据集的依赖，利用易于获取的人类视频和强大的预训练模型先验。\n-   **硬件无关与可扩展**：为实现**可扩展的、硬件无关的灵巧操作**指明了一条路径，新设计的灵巧手可以快速部署，无需从头开始收集数据。\n-   **功能化抓取**：生成的抓取不仅稳定，而且符合人类抓取的功能性意图（例如，握锤子的手柄而非锤头），提升了抓取的实用性和任务相关性。\n-   **性能卓越**：实验表明，该方法在**手指特定可供性定位精度**和**真实世界灵巧抓取成功率**（最高达90%）上均优于现有方法，并能很好地泛化到未见过的物体类别和不同灵巧手上。\n\n**总结**：FSAG 的核心创新在于创造性地利用**生成式扩散模型的语义理解能力**，构建了一个**细粒度、手指级、语义 grounded 的可供性表示（FSAF）**，并以此为基础，通过**与硬件解耦的优化规划**，实现了数据高效、功能正确且可跨硬件泛化的灵巧抓取合成。",

            "answer": "## 论文发展脉络梳理：从粗粒度到细粒度、从数据驱动到先验驱动的灵巧手抓取\n\n本文（FSAG）是**基于预训练扩散模型的语义先验**和**人类视频演示**，实现**数据高效、跨具身、指级细粒度**的抓取规划。其发展脉络可以梳理为以下几个关键方向，每一步都针对前作的局限性进行了针对性改进：\n\n### 方向一：抓取表示从“粗粒度区域”到“细粒度指级接触”\n\n1.  **早期工作：并行夹爪与区域级可操作性**\n    *   **代表工作**：传统的并行夹爪抓取研究，以及早期基于深度学习的可操作性预测工作（如 [22, 23]）。\n    *   **核心表示**：预测物体上“可抓取”的**二维边界框或掩码区域**。这种表示回答了“**在哪里**”抓取，但非常粗糙。\n    *   **局限性**：对于具有多个手指、需要复杂接触模式的灵巧手而言，仅知道一个大致区域**完全不足以指导具体的抓取动作**。它无法指定每个手指应该放在哪里、以什么角度接近。\n\n2.  **中期改进：关键点与接触点表示**\n    *   **代表工作**：将抓取表示为几个**3D关键点**（如手腕、指尖位置）或**接触点集合**（如 [37, 39]）。\n    *   **核心表示**：从区域细化到离散的**点**。这为控制提供了更精确的目标。\n    *   **局限性**：\n        *   **语义缺失**：关键点通常通过几何或外观特征学习，缺乏对物体**功能部件**（如锤柄、瓶盖）的语义理解，导致抓取可能功能不当（如抓锤头）。\n        *   **指级关系模糊**：如CMKA [37] 仅预测三个关键点（对应功能指、小指、手腕），**固定了手指的角色分配**，限制了抓取策略的多样性，且难以泛化到不同形态的物体。\n        *   **数据依赖**：获取精确的3D手-物体接触数据（如DexYCB [4]）成本极高。\n\n3.  **本文FSAG的突破：指级可操作性场**\n    *   **核心创新**：提出 **Finger-Specific Affordance Field**。\n    *   **改进之处**：\n        *   **细粒度与语义结合**：为物体图像上的每个像素预测**五个独立通道的热力图**，分别对应拇指、食指、中指、无名指、小指的接触可能性。这直接将“在哪里抓”分解为“每个手指应该接触哪里”。\n        *   **注入语义先验**：利用**Stable Diffusion**在大量互联网图像中学到的**物体部件、功能和手-物体交互知识**，使预测的接触点自然落在功能部件上（如抓瓶身、握锤柄）。\n        *   **数据高效**：仅需少量人类视频演示（130个）提供指尖标注，即可学习到强大的指级可操作性预测模型，避免了大规模机器人抓取数据收集。\n\n### 方向二：学习方法从“大规模仿真/现实数据”到“小样本演示+基础模型先验”\n\n1.  **数据驱动范式：仿真RL与大规模真实数据**\n    *   **代表工作**：在仿真中使用强化学习探索高维动作空间（如 [36]），或收集大规模真实世界抓取数据（如 AnyDexGrasp [9]）。\n    *   **优势**：能在特定设置下实现高性能。\n    *   **局限性**：\n        *   **仿真到现实的鸿沟**：仿真策略依赖完美状态信息，对真实传感噪声（如深度缺失、遮挡）鲁棒性差。\n        *   **成本与泛化**：大规模真实数据收集**成本极其高昂**，且学到的策略与**特定灵巧手的动力学紧密耦合**，难以迁移到新手上（“具身过拟合”）。\n\n2.  **模仿学习范式：从人类演示直接学习**\n    *   **代表工作**：通过运动重定向将人类视频转换为机器人轨迹进行模仿学习（如 [25]）。\n    *   **优势**：利用人类自然、高效的技能。\n    *   **局限性**：通常仍需在仿真中进行大量微调（再次引入sim-to-real gap），且学到的策略是**轨迹级别的黑箱**，对物体姿态、形状变化的泛化能力有限。\n\n3.  **本文FSAG的突破：先验驱动的小样本学习**\n    *   **核心创新**：**解耦感知与控制**，利用**冻结的预训练扩散模型**作为语义感知骨干。\n    *   **改进之处**：\n        *   **绕过机器人数据收集**：不再需要任何机器人抓取数据。核心的指级可操作性预测模块仅从**人类视频图像+扩散模型先验**中学习。\n        *   **泛化能力来源**：泛化能力主要来自**扩散模型强大的跨类别语义理解能力**，而非大量任务数据。这使得模型能对未见过的物体实例进行合理的指级接触点预测。\n        *   **表示可迁移**：学习到的是物体中心的、指级的**可操作性表示**，该表示与具体手型无关，为后续的跨具身迁移奠定了基础。\n\n### 方向三：系统泛化从“具身特定”到“硬件无关”\n\n1.  **传统局限：一机一策**\n    *   **大多数现有方法**：无论是仿真RL还是模仿学习，学到的策略（神经网络）其参数都隐式编码了特定灵巧手的关节范围、连杆长度、指尖大小等信息。\n    *   **后果**：为新的灵巧手部署需要**从头开始收集数据和训练**，无法迁移。\n\n2.  **本文FSAG的突破：基于优化的跨具身规划**\n    *   **核心创新**：采用**基于优化的运动规划**（阻尼最小二乘QP）来执行抓取，而非学习一个策略网络。\n    *   **改进之处**：\n        *   **表示与执行解耦**：FSAG模块输出的是**在物体坐标系下的3D指尖接触点目标及其法线方向**。这是一个**与手型无关的任务描述**。\n        *   **通用执行器**：优化器接收这些目标，结合**当前使用的灵巧手的运动学（正向运动学、雅可比矩阵）和动力学约束**（关节限位、碰撞），实时求解关节指令。**只需更换运动学模型，同一套规划器即可适配新手**。\n        *   **实验验证**：论文展示了在DexHand021和Linker Hand L20两种截然不同的灵巧手之间**零样本迁移**，成功率保持稳定，证明了其硬件无关性。\n\n### 总结：FSAG的核心推进\nFSAG并非孤立工作，它站在了三个发展方向的前沿交汇点：\n1.  **在表示上**，将**语义基础模型**与**指级细粒度建模**结合，实现了功能感知的抓取。\n2.  **在数据上**，用**基础模型先验**替代**海量机器人数据**，实现了小样本高效学习。\n3.  **在系统上**，用**与手型无关的可操作性表示+模型预测控制**替代**具身特定的策略网络**，实现了真正的跨具身泛化。\n\n它指明了一个新范式：**利用大规模预训练模型蕴含的物理和语义常识，将人类演示提炼为可迁移的、细粒度的任务表示，再通过通用规划器适配到不同的机器人身体上**，从而迈向可扩展的、通用的灵巧操作。",

            "answer": "## 论文主要局限性分析\n\n基于对论文内容的分析，FSAG方法虽然取得了显著成果，但仍存在以下主要局限性：\n\n- **执行环节的闭环控制缺失**：论文明确指出，在抓取**细长物体**（如螺丝刀、笔）时，即使接触点预测准确，**简单的开环、固定偏移量的闭合动作**也可能导致物体旋转或滑落。这暴露出现有运动规划模块在**接触力控制、滑动检测和在线适应性调整**方面的不足。\n\n- **对感知模块的依赖与潜在误差**：整个流程严重依赖前端感知的准确性：\n    - **深度估计**：依赖FoundationStereo进行深度恢复，在透明、反光或纹理缺失的物体上可能失效。\n    - **实例分割**：依赖GroundingDINO-SAM2获取物体掩码，在物体堆叠或严重遮挡场景下分割可能不准确。\n    - **这些感知误差会直接传导至后续的接触点映射和运动规划**，导致失败。\n\n- **数据标注与泛化范围的限制**：\n    - 方法需要**少量带指尖标注的人类演示视频**进行监督训练。虽然数据量远小于仿真或大规模真机采集，但**标注过程仍需成本**。\n    - 实验验证的对象类别（13种）和场景（桌面单一物体抓取）相对有限。在**更复杂、非结构化的真实环境**（如杂乱桌面、动态场景）中的泛化能力有待验证。\n\n- **方法假设与场景约束**：\n    - 假设物体在**“无手”关键帧**中完全可见，这在动态或持续交互场景中可能不成立。\n    - 当前的**运动规划基于优化求解**，计算效率在更复杂的任务（如带障碍物的灵巧操作）中可能成为瓶颈。\n    - **未充分利用多视角信息**，仅依赖单视角的RGB-D输入，对自遮挡严重的物体可能无法重建完整几何。\n\n## 未来可能的改进方向\n\n针对上述局限性，论文在结论部分及分析中暗示了以下未来工作方向：\n\n- **增强闭环与触觉反馈**：\n    ```python\n    # 未来方向示例：结合力/触觉的闭环控制\n    未来系统 = FSAG(接触点预测) + 学习型阻抗控制 + 六维力/触觉传感器反馈\n    ```\n    - 集成**六维力/力矩传感器**或**触觉传感器**，实现基于接触力估计和滑动检测的**在线调整策略**。\n    - 开发**学习型残差阻抗控制**或操作空间控制，使机器人在接触后能动态适应物体运动和受力变化。\n\n- **提升感知鲁棒性与多模态融合**：\n    - 探索更鲁棒的**多视角融合**或**主动感知**策略，以应对单视角遮挡问题。\n    - 研究如何将扩散模型提供的语义先验与**3D几何学习（如3D扩散模型）** 更深度地结合，减少对独立深度估计和分割模块的依赖。\n\n- **扩展任务范围与数据效率**：\n    - 将框架扩展到**更复杂的灵巧操作任务**，如使用工具、重新摆放、双手协调等。\n    - 探索**更高效或无监督的标注方式**，例如利用大规模人类视频（无精确指尖标注）进行弱监督或自监督学习，进一步降低数据依赖。\n\n- **算法与系统的优化**：\n    - 优化运动规划器，结合**学习型采样**或**分层规划**，以处理更复杂的障碍物环境和动态场景。\n    - 研究如何将**FSAF表示**与**强化学习**结合，在保持跨本体泛化优势的同时，实现更动态和适应性的策略学习。\n\n**总结**：FSAG的核心创新在于利用预训练扩散模型的语义先验，实现了数据高效和跨本体的灵巧抓取。其当前局限主要集中于**执行层的开环控制、感知链的误差累积以及场景复杂性**。未来的改进将围绕**引入触觉闭环、增强感知鲁棒性、拓展任务边界**展开，旨在构建更通用、更鲁棒的灵巧操作系统。",
