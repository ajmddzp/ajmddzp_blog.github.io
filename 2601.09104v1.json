Most existing soft grippers are pneumatically actuated with several hundred kPa pressure, and cannot generate output force sufficient for such a large and heavy object. Instead of pneumatic actuation, hydraulic actuation has a potential to generate much larger power by several MPa pressure.\nIn this study, we develop a hydraulically-driven soft gripper, in which its basic design parameters are determined based on a mathematical model that represents the relationship among the driving pressure, bending angle, object mass and grasping force.\nMoreover, we selected materials suitable for grasping a heavier object, based on the finite element analysis result of the detailed design. We report experimental results on a 20 kg object grasping and closed-loop control of the finger bending angle.\nkeywords:\nSoft Robotic Gripper; Hydraulics; Modeling and Control for Soft Robots\n†\n†\narticletype:\nADVANCED ROBOTICS\n0\n0\n0\n©  2026 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Several types of soft grippers have been developed, each utilizing different materials, actuation methods, and design principles, such as pneumatically actuated grippers\n[\n32\n]\n, electroactive polymer grippers\n[\n8\n,\n19\n]\n, shape memory alloy (SMA) grippers\n[\n33\n]\n, magnetorheological (MR) fluid grippers\n[\n20\n]\n, electroadhesion grippers\n[\n7\n]\n, gripper with Gecko-inspired adhesives\n[\n24\n]\n, soft grippers with jamming mechanisms\n[\n1\n]\nand Origami-inspired grippers\n[\n16\n]\n.\nHowever, most existing soft grippers are pneumatically actuated with several hundred kPa pressure, and cannot generate output force sufficient for such a large and heavy object that usually human is capable of — approximately 10 - 20 kg with 20 - 30 cm diameter.\nAccording to the Health and Safety Executive in the UK\n[\n10\n]\n, a human worker is encouraged to carry an object less than 16 kg for woman and 25 kg for man to reduce the risk of injury.\nThere are a few attempts to develop a soft gripper that can grasp a heavy object. Yap et al.\n[\n34\n]\ndeveloped a soft robot gripper capable of grasping objects up to 10 cm and 5 kg. However, it was reported\n[\n34\n]\nthat its output power decreases as the target object size increases. Hwang et al.\n[\n12\n]\ndeveloped a gripper using electro-adhesion that was capable of 16.8 kg. However, this gripper was not suitable for an object with rough and moist surfaces.\nInstead of pneumatic actuation, hydraulic actuation has a potential to generate much larger power by several MPa pressure.\nPreviously, Hagiwara et al.\n[\n9\n]\ndeveloped a hydraulically-driven soft gripper capable of grasping a 5 kg object.\nThen, we developed a prototype of a hydraulically-driven soft gripper for transporting large and heavy vegetables in a vegetable factory\n[\n2\n,\n14\n]\n.\nHowever, those studies focused on the design of the soft finger with durability of high pressure, and the analysis on the actuation performance by a hydraulic pump.\nIn the design and control of a soft gripper, it is important to analyze the total system mechanics consisting of hydraulic pump, soft fingers and target object.\nIn\n[\n13\n]\n, we constructed a mathematical model of the soft gripper including the actuation unit, and showed that the oil reservoir with rubber sheet can boost the pump actuation and decrease the pressure necessary for bending the soft fingers.\nIn this paper, we present a design methodology of a hydraulically-driven soft robotic gripper for grasping an object with 10 to 20 kg weight and 20 to 30 cm diameter.\nWe estimate the maximum payload based on the previously developed model and the friction condition.\nThen, we conduct a strength analysis by finite element method (FEM) in the detailed design of the soft gripper and select appropriate material for grasping a 20 kg object.\nFinally, we report experimental results on the 20 kg payload test, grasping various objects, and a closed-loop control based on the proposed model.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section\n2\npresents the basic structure of the soft gripper and its mathematical model. Section\n3\ndetails the design based on the parameters obtained in Section\n2\nand provides the FEM analysis. Section\n4\nreports the experimental validations.\nFinally, Section\n5\nprovides discussions on the obtained results, and Section\n6\nconcludes this paper.\nPortions of this paper were previously presented in\n[\n13\n]\n, including the basic of mathematical model (Section\n2\n.2), and the structure of the soft gripper (Section\n3\n.1).\nWhereas the previous paper\n[\n13\n]\nfocused on the feedback control of the bending\nangle and the evaluation of the grasping flexibility achieved by the feedback, the main contribution of this study is to present a design methodology to achieve high payload such as 20 kg and to provide its experimental validations.\n2\nDesign Methodology of Hydraulically-driven Soft Robot Gripper\n2.1\nStructure of Hydraulically-driven Soft Robot Gripper\nFig.\n1\nshows the structure of the hydraulically-driven soft robot gripper including its actuation system.\nA hydraulic pump generates a differential pressure, in which the high- and low-pressure sides are connected to soft fingers and oil reservoir, respectively.\nThe differential pressure sends the oil from the reservoir to the soft fingers and pressurizes the inner flow path of the soft finger.\nWe employ the fiber-constrained design\n[\n28\n,\n5\n]\n, in which the radial expansion is constrained by wrapping a thread around the finger, as shown in Fig.\n1\n(b).\nWhen the inner flow path is pressurized, the finger expands only in the axial direction.\nThis expansion is transformed into a bending deformation because one side of the finger is constrained by an inelastic part.\nFig.\n1\n(c) illustrates the structure of the oil reservoir, consisting of a circular sheet made of NBR and a ring-shaped metal part and base.\n(a)\nActuation system for soft robot gripper\n(b)\nSoft finger\n(c)\nReservoir to store oil\nFigure 1:\n(a) Soft fingers are connected to the high-pressure side of the hydraulic pump while a reservoir is connected to the low-pressure side. The pump generates differential pressure, sending oil from the reservoir to the soft fingers. (b) Structure and bending mechanism of fiber-constrained soft finger. Fiber-constrained soft fingers utilize the expansion of soft materials under pressure and deform only in a certain direction by embedding inelastic materials. (c) Structure of reservoir. The reservoir consists of a circular sheet made of NBR, along with a ring-shaped metal part and base.\n2.2\nModeling of Hydraulically-driven Soft Robot Gripper\n[\n13\n]\nFigure 2:\nGeometric Model of hydraulic soft gripper. (a) Soft finger. (b) Cross section of finger. (c) Reservoir made of rubber sheet. Reservoir consists of a circular sheet made of NBR, along with a ring-shaped metal part and base, as shown in Fig.\n1\n(b).\nWe formulated a mathematical model to represent the relationship among the driving pressure, bending angle of a finger, and grasping force on a target object. Renda et al.\n[\n22\n,\n23\n]\nproposed a PCS model that divides a flexible rod structure into a finite number of segments with constant strain, deriving its kinematics and dynamics. Polygerinos et al.\n[\n21\n,\n29\n]\nmodeled fiber-reinforced soft fingers assuming constant curvature, while Mustaza et al.\n[\n18\n]\ndeveloped a manipulator with fiber-constrained actuators and used Lagrange’s equations for dynamic modeling. Sedal et al.\n[\n26\n]\nderived equations for fiber-constrained soft actuators, relating various mechanical parameters under static conditions using continuum mechanics. However, these studies focused on modeling the soft finger alone, without considering the entire gripper system. In\n[\n13\n]\n, we proposed a mathematical model that includes both the soft fingers and the reservoir and demonstrate that the reservoir’s elasticity contributes to efficient actuation.\nTable

The gripper is composed of soft fingers, pressure sensors, a reservoir for storing oil, a hydraulic pump, and a motor for driving the pump.\nFig.\n4\nshows the developed soft gripper. The width and height are 278 mm and 346 mm, respectively, with a total weight of approximately 2.8 kg, including the actuation unit (1.67 kg) consisting of a hydraulic pump and electric motor.\nWe used a hydraulic pump (dimensions: 42 x 47.2 x 22.8 mm; weight: 228 g) developed in\n[\n15\n]\n.\nTwo pressure sensors are equipped on the high- and low-pressure sides of the pump flow path, which enables us to measure the differential pressure for the pressure control by the motor current.\nFigure 5:\nFabricated soft finger. (a) Structure of soft finger, (b) Resistive flexible sensor, (c) Image of finger shell bending.\nFig.\n5\nshows the structure of the developed soft finger. The fabrication process is summarized as follows:\n1.\nThe exoskeleton parts of the fingers are made of A5052 to prevent excessive twisting in the axial direction. These parts are connected by hinge joints. Two flexible sensors (SPECTRASYMBOL-006, Spectra Symbol, Inc) shown in Fig.\n5\n(b) are inside the exoskeleton to measure the bending angle.\n2.\nNext, a 3D-printed cover is attached to each exoskeleton part. The covers are made of PLA, except for the fingertip, which is made of A5052 based on an FEM analysis discussed in the next subsection.\n3.\nFinally, an NBR tube (\nϕ\n18\n×\n\\phi 18\\times\n180 mm, and 4 mm thick) constrained by Kevlar thread is inserted into the exoskeleton parts.\n3.2\nFEM Analysis\nBased on the detailed design of the developed gripper, we conducted an FEM analysis to select suitable materials for the necessary parts, and also determine the specific values of\n𝒘\n\\bm{w}\nin the mathematical model.\nUsing the parameters listed in Table\n2\n, we simulated a finger movement setting the driving pressure to 2.0 MPa, 3.0 MPa and 4.0 MPa.\nFig.\n6\nshows the results of the FEM analysis, and Table\n3\nsummarizes the maximum stress in the fingertip components.\nWhen applying 4.0 MPa pressure, the maximum stress was 235.4 MPa at the fingertip cap and 170.3 MPa at the hinge joint in the fingertip. Since the fracture strength of PLA is 55 MPa, we selected A5052 for these parts due to its higher strength.\nMoreover, the strength of NBR with 70 Shore A hardness is 12.7 MPa, which affords to the driving pressure.\nFigure 6:\nFEM simulations of an object grasping under pressure of 2.0 MPa, 3.0 MPa and 4.0 MPa. This figure indicates that stress is concentrated at the cap and hinge points at the tips of the fingers.\nTable 2:\nParameter used in FEM simulation\nMooney-Rivlin coefficient of NBR tube\nC\n10\n=\n0.41\nC_{10}=0.41\n,\nC\n01\n=\n0.43\nC_{01}=0.43\nYoung’s modulus of A5052 metal parts\n68 MPa\nPoisson’s ratio of A5052 metal parts\n0.33\nYoung’s modulus of PLA parts\n3.5 MPa\nPoisson’s ratio of PLA parts\n0.3\nYoung’s modulus of Kevlar thread beam\n31 MPa\nPoisson’s ratio of Kevlar thread beam\n0.36\nRadius of Kevlar thread beam\n0.2 mm\nTable 3:\nComparison of maximum stress and material fracture strength applied to fingers.\nPressure applied to the finger\n2.0MPa\n3.0MPa\n4.0MPa\nMaximum stress of a cap part of the finger\n124.8MPa\n153.4MPa\n235.4MPa\nMaximum stress of a hinge structure\n82.3MPa\n114.4MPa\n170.3MPa\nMaximum stress of a rubber tube\n3.3MPa\n3.9MPa\n4.9MPa\nPLA strength\n55MPa\nA5052 strength\n260MPa\nNBR strength\n12.7MPa\nIt is observed from Fig.\n6\nthat the 5th joint bent more largely than the other joints when the pressure is increased.\nWe consider that this is because the fingertip contacts with the object on a fixed point.\nThis result implies that the assumption in the previous section does not apply — all joints do not have the same angle but different angles.\nTherefore, we determine the value of the coefficient vector\n𝒘\n\\bm{w}\nbased on the FEM result in\n[\n13\n]\n.\nIn the FEM simulation, the values of\nΔ\n​\nθ\ni\n​\n(\ni\n=\n1\n,\n⋯\n,\n5\n)\n\\varDelta\\theta_{i}\\ (i=1,\\cdots,5)\nwere calculated in each step of the simulation, and we used those values to determine\n𝒘\n\\bm{w}\n.\nAs a result, the value of\n𝒘\n\\bm{w}\nwas set as\n𝒘\n=\n(\n−\n0.2\n,\n0.0\n,\n0.1\n,\n0.3\n,\n0.8\n)\nT\n\\bm{w}=(-0.2,0.0,0.1,0.3,0.8)^{T}\n.\nMoreover, the modeling using this value of\n𝒘\n\\bm{w}\nwas validated in\n[\n13\n]\nbased on a preliminary experiment on a 6 kg object, which will be shown in Section\n4\n.\n4\nExperimental Validations\nFigure 7:\nPre-experiment to re-estimate the maximum payload. In this experiment, we tested a grasping of a 6 kg dumbbell.\nFigure 8:\nMaximum payload of four-finger soft gripper when wrapping an object. For a pressure of 2.0 MPa, the gripper can grasp a maximum weight of 27 kg at 40 degrees and a maximum weight of 20 kg at 70 degrees.\nFigure 9:\nExperimental scene of 20 kg payload test. In this experiment, a four-finger soft gripper grasped a dumbbells whose total weight is 20 kg and held it for 10 s by the 2.0 MPa pressure control.\n4.1\nMaximum Payload\nWe experimentally validate the maximum payload of the developed gripper.\nBefore the experiment, we re-estimate the maximum payload, which was originally presented in Fig.\n3\n, based on the mathematical model using the value of\n𝒘\n\\bm{w}\ndetermined as mentioned in the previous section.\nThe relationship between the finger angle and the grasping force using this value was validated also in\n[\n13\n]\nwith a preliminary experiment using the 6 kg object (shown in Fig.\n7\n).\nFig.\n8\nshows the updated result of the maximum payload to a given finger bending angle.\nGiven a pressure of 2.0 MPa, the maximum payload is estimated as 27 kg at 40\n∘\nand 20 kg at 70\n∘\n.\nFig.\n9\nshows an experimental scene in which the developed soft gripper grasps a set of dumbbells whose total weight is 20 kg and holds it for 10 s.\nThe results of the 20 kg payload is consistent with the result of Fig.\n8\n.\nAlthough we set the value of\n𝒘\n\\bm{w}\nbased on the FEM result with a 240 mm diameter object, this condition does not always apply to unknown shape object.\nIndeed, the shape of the 20 kg object was largely different from the 240 mm diameter sphere object.\nRather, this result shows that the payload estimation based on the developed model can be applied to such a different condition as the softness of the developed hand absorbed an uncertainty.\n4.2\nExamples of Grasping Various Objects\nMoreover, we validated the adaptability of the developed soft gripper to various objects as shown in Fig.\n10\n, including some large size vegetables.\nThe simple pressure control enabled the soft gripper to grasp various industrial products including Fig.\n10\n(a)(c) cable reals and (b) a bucket.\nOne of possible applications of this gripper is a picking task in a vegetable factory.\nWe also demonstrated (d) Chinese cabbage, (e) cabbage and (f) radishes were grasped by the developed gripper.\nThese results show that the developed hand achieved not only high payload but also high adaptability to variety in different conditions of shape and surface.\nFigure 10:\nGrasping various objects: (a) cable reel (5.8 kg), (b) bucket (4 kg), (c) cable real (6 kg), (d) Chinese cabbage (2.6 kg), (e) cabbage (2.3 kg), and (f) three radishes (\n≃\n\\simeq\n2.1 kg).\n4.3\nClosed-loop Control of Finger Bending Angle\nFigure 11:\nTwo-degree-of-freedom control of the bending angle of the fingers using the relationship between\nθ\n\\theta\nand\nP\nP\nobtained by (\n26\n). The average angle of fingers was controlled to follow the commanded angle since each finger is connected to the same flow path.\nFinally, we validated a feedback control of the finger angles.\nWhile we demonstrated a robustness of the feedback control to horizontal-direction disturbance in\n[\n13\n]\n, we demonstrate a robustness to vertical-direction disturbance in this study.\nFig.\n11\nshows a block diagram of the 2-DOF control that we implemented in\n[\n13\n]\n.

The dotted line indicates the case without grasping an object, represented by (\n26\n).\n5.2\nCalculation of Graspable Area\nFurthermore, the obtained model can be used to visualize the conditions under which the gripper can grasp an object. The conditions for grasping an object were represented by (\n29\n). Fig.\n15\nshows the graspable area of an object when the gripper wraps an object. The vertical axis represents the driving pressure, the horizontal axis represents the bending angle, and the color difference indicates the magnitude of the grasping force\nF\nv\nF_{v}\n.

Since the fracture strength of PLA is 55 MPa, we selected A5052 for these parts due to its higher strength.\n2.\nWe estimated the maximum payload based on the previously developed model and the friction condition, and confirmed the maximum payload would be more than 20 kg.\nIn the original estimation, we assumed the coefficients used in the model had the same value.\nHowever, the FEM analysis showed that the joint angle were different when the gripper grasped an object.\nTherefore, we determined the coefficient values from the FEM result, which was validated with the preliminary experiment with the 6 kg object, and re-calculated the payload, which showed that the maximum payload was 20 kg when the total finger angle was 70\n∘\n.\n3.\nThe maximum payload was experimentally validated.\nWe also experimentally demonstrated the adaptability of the developed soft gripper to various objects with different shape and size.\nMoreover, the closed-loop control of the finger angle demonstrated the robustness to vertical disturbances.\nThese results imply that the developed soft gripper achieved the 20 kg payload without loosing the flexibility, adaptability and robustness.\nAcknowledgement\nThis research was supported by the National Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Research Organization’s International Competitiveness Enhancement Technology Development Project ”Development of Agricultural Work Automation Technology Utilizing Robot Arms Suitable for Agricultural Products” (Research Leader: Takanori Fukao).\nReferences\n[1]\nJ.

    "preview_text": "This paper presents a design methodology of a hydraulically-driven soft robotic gripper for grasping a large and heavy object -- approximately 10 - 20 kg with 20 - 30 cm diameter. Most existing soft grippers are pneumatically actuated with several hundred kPa pressure, and cannot generate output force sufficient for such a large and heavy object. Instead of pneumatic actuation, hydraulic actuation has a potential to generate much larger power by several MPa pressure. In this study, we develop a hydraulically-driven soft gripper, in which its basic design parameters are determined based on a mathematical model that represents the relationship among the driving pressure, bending angle, object mass and grasping force. Moreover, we selected materials suitable for grasping a heavier object, based on the finite element analysis result of the detailed design. We report experimental results on a 20 kg object grasping and closed-loop control of the finger bending angle.\n\nDesign Methodology of Hydraulically-driven Soft Robotic Gripper for a Large and Heavy Object\nKo Yamamoto\na\n∗1\n∗1\nCONTACT Ko Yamamoto.
