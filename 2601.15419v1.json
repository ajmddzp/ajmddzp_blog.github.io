Our method proceeds in two stages: first, we construct a decoupled latent space that captures localized motion patterns across different body parts using contrastive learning, enabling accurate and flexible motion retargeting even across robots with diverse morphologies. To enhance alignment between embodiments, we introduce tailored similarity metrics that combine joint rotation and end-effector positioning for critical segments, such as arms. Then, we train a goal-conditioned control policy directly within this latent space using only human data. Leveraging a conditional variational autoencoder, our policy learns to predict latent space displacements guided by intended goal directions. We show that the trained policy can be directly deployed on multiple robots without any adaptation. Furthermore, our method supports the efficient addition of new robots to the latent space by learning only a lightweight, robot-specific embedding layer. The learned latent policies can also be directly applied to the new robots. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables robust, scalable, and embodiment-agnostic robot control across a wide range of humanoid platforms.\nI\nIntroduction\nControlling a diverse range of humanoid platforms through a unified interface remains a long-standing ambition in robotics. Achieving this goal, however, is highly challenging due to the vast variability in robot morphology, degrees of freedom, and kinematic constraints. A key requirement for scalable generalization is to develop control policies that can seamlessly transfer across embodiments without retraining or platform-specific finetuning. In this work, we address the problem of cross-embodiment humanoid robot control by learning a unified shared latent space. Control policies trained in the latent space can be deployed on any robot that is encoded in this space.\nRecent advancements in robot learning, particularly in cross-domain imitation learning\n[\n10\n]\n, have enabled more flexible and adaptable robot control across different embodiments. A common approach to bridging the embodiment gap is to learn task-relevant, domain-invariant representations\n[\n18\n,\n6\n,\n19\n]\n. For example, to enable robots to learn manipulation skills from human demonstrations, prior work\n[\n14\n,\n12\n,\n16\n]\naligns cross-domain skill representations between human videos and robot demonstrations. However, these methods often require a substantial amount of paired demonstration data from both domains, limiting scalability and hindering transferability to new, unseen platforms—an increasingly important consideration given the rapid diversification of robotic morphologies.\nBeyond task-relevant feature extraction, another promising strategy for bridging the embodiment gap is to construct a shared latent space between embodiments, where semantically similar actions are mapped to proximate points regardless of the originating domain. Early efforts in this direction\n[\n4\n,\n9\n,\n1\n]\nfocused on learning shared representations for translating motions from humans to robots or animated characters, but relied heavily on manually collected paired datasets. To overcome this data bottleneck, Choi et al.\n[\n2\n]\nproposed a self-supervised paired data generation technique, automating the process of building correspondences between domains. More recently, Yan et al.\n[\n17\n]\nintroduced a contrastive learning approach to discover a shared latent space, enhancing both the expressiveness and smoothness of motion retargeting between humans and robots. However, the prior work addressed the retargeting from humans to a specific robot embodiment. Our primary goal is to learn a unified latent space across diverse embodiments, which later allows unified policies to control multiple robots.\nIn this work, we tackle the problem of cross-embodiment robot control, where the objective is to develop a single control framework capable of operating across diverse robotic embodiments. Specifically, we aim to achieve two key capabilities: (1) learning a shared latent representation that captures motion semantics across diverse embodiments, and (2) training a goal-conditioned control policy within this shared space that can be directly deployed to all robots that are encoded in the shared space.\nTo this end, we propose a two-stage approach. In the first stage, we learn a unified latent space that aligns motions from varied embodiments into a common representation. Building on insights from contrastive learning and motion retargeting, we introduce a decoupled latent structure that models different body parts independently (arms, legs, trunk). This modular design allows for finer-grained alignment across embodiments with asymmetric or partial limb structures and enables the use of customized similarity metrics, such as combining joint rotation and end-effector positioning for arm movements. Our method not only unifies diverse embodiments into a shared latent space\nbut also improves the cross-embodiment motion retargeting performance.\nIn the second stage, we leverage the learned latent space to train a goal-conditioned motion generation policy based purely on human motions. Using a conditional variational autoencoder (c-VAE) framework, we model motion generation as predicting latent displacements guided by intention features derived from end-effector velocities toward user-specified goals. By operating directly in the latent space, the policy achieves embodiment-agnostic control, allowing motions trained on human demonstrations to be seamlessly executed across multiple robot platforms. Importantly, the modularity of our system enables efficient scaling to new robots: integrating a new embodiment requires only learning a lightweight, robot-specific embedding layer, without re-training the entire model.\nThe proposed approach has the following contributions.\n•\na decoupled latent space architecture that enables fine-grained motion alignment across a wide range of robot morphologies.\n•\na modular contrastive learning framework with tailored similarity metrics, capable of jointly learning motion representations from both human and multiple robot embodiments.\n•\na goal-conditioned control policy that operates directly within the shared latent space, allowing accurate multi-robot control without any additional fine-tuning.\n•\na scalable framework by adding new robots through lightweight embedding training, enabling efficient deployment in multi-robot systems\nII\nMethodology\nIn this section, we address the cross-embodiment robot control as a two-stage problem. Our method first learns a unified latent space over different robots. Then, we formulate multi-robot control as controlling the shared latent space. An overview of the two stages is illustrated in Fig.\n1\nand Fig.\n2\n, respectively.\nFigure 1:\nLearning a Unified Latent Representation.\nOur architecture learns a shared latent space that unifies motion representations across diverse embodiments, including humans and various robots. To accurately model local motion patterns, we decouple the latent space into five subspaces corresponding to distinct body segments: left arm (LA), right arm (RA), trunk (TK), left leg (LL), and right leg (RL). The model comprises a human encoder (\nE\nh\nE_{h}\n), a cross-embodiment encoder (\nE\nX\nE_{X}\n), and a cross-embodiment decoder (\nD\nX\nD_{X}\n). To accommodate differences in pose dimensionality across robot platforms, each robot is assigned a learnable, robot-specific embedding layer\nE\nr\nE_{r}\n, which projects the raw pose representation into a shared cross-embodiment feature space. Conversely,\nD\nr\nD_{r}\nis the inverse mapping back to the original pose space.\nII-A\nProblem Formulation\nTo enable control across a diverse set of robotic embodiments within a multi-robot system, our approach comprises two main components: (1) learning a shared representation across all robots, and (2) training a control policy within this shared space.\nWe tackle the challenge of learning a shared latent space by enabling robots to retarget motions from other embodiments within this latent representation. To formalize the cross-embodiment motion retargeting problem, we represent a pose of embodiment\nA\nA\nas\n𝐱\nA\n∈\nℝ\nJ\nA\n×\nn\nA\n\\mathbf{x}_{A}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{J_{A}\\times n_{A}}\n, where\nA\nA\ndenotes a specific embodiment (e.g., a human or a robot),\nJ\nA\nJ_{A}\nis the number of joints in embodiment\nA\nA\n, and\nn\nA\nn_{A}\nis the dimensionality of its joint representation. In our setup, human joints are represented using quaternions (\nn\n=\n4\nn=4\n) while robot joints use scalar joint angles (\nn\n=\n1\nn=1\n).\nA motion for Embodiment\nA\nA\nis denoted as\n𝐗\nA\n1\n:\nT\n=\n[\n𝐱\nA\n1\n,\n𝐱\nA\n2\n,\n⋯\n,\n𝐱\nA\nT\n]\n\\mathbf{X}_{A}^{1:T}=[\\mathbf{x}_{A}^{1},\\mathbf{x}_{A}^{2},\\cdots,\\mathbf{x}_{A}^{T}]\n. The goal of cross-embodiment motion retargeting is to learn a mapping function\nf\n:\n𝐗\nA\n1\n:\nT\n→\n𝐘\nB\n1\n:\nT\nf:\\mathbf{X}_{A}^{1:T}\\rightarrow\\mathbf{Y}_{B}^{1:T}\nthat transfers a motion sequence from embodiment\nA\nA\nto a corresponding motion in embodiment\nB\nB\n, such that the retargeted motion\n𝐘\nB\n1\n:\nT\n\\mathbf{Y}_{B}^{1:T}\npreserves the style and intent of the original motion\n𝐗\nA\n1\n:\nT\n\\mathbf{X}_{A}^{1:T}\n.\nWe build on ImitationNet\n[\n17\n]\n, leveraging its unsupervised, contrastive learning-based approach to learn a shared latent space. Unlike the original formulation, limited to human-robot transfer, our method generalizes this latent space to accommodate arbitrary embodiments, facilitating broader cross-platform motion retargeting.\nII-B\nSegment-aware Latent Space and Similarity Metric\nThe prior approaches\n[\n1\n,\n17\n]\nemploy a single latent space to represent whole-body motions. However, this design can lead to ambiguous mappings between embodiments with differing morphologies. For example, the ATLAS robot possesses articulated arms, legs, and a trunk, while the H1 robot exhibits limited trunk articulation, and the TIAGO robot is restricted to arm movements only.\nTo address this limitation, we propose decoupling the latent space into distinct subspaces for different body segments. Specifically, we segment the body into five components: left arm (LA), right arm (RA), trunk (TK), left leg (LL), and right leg (RL). Each segment is modeled with its own dedicated latent space, allowing us to better capture localized motion features and accommodate embodiments with partial or asymmetric limb structures.\nThe decomposition of latent space also enables the use of customized similarity metrics for contrastive learning within each subspace. For example, end-effector position is critical in robot applications such as manipulation. In contrast, mimicking limb rotations is important for the trunk and legs to preserve visual fidelity during motion retargeting. Therefore, we design a hybrid similarity metric for the arm segments that jointly accounts for limb rotations and end-effector positions, while applying a rotation-based similarity metric to the other body segments.\nWe define the rotation-based similarity metric as follows:\nD\nR\n(\n𝐱\nA\n,\n𝐱\nB\n)\n=\n∑\nj\n(\n1\n−\n<\nq\nA\nj\n,\nq\nB\nj\n>\n2\n)\n,\nD_{R}(\\mathbf{x}_{A},\\mathbf{x}_{B})=\\sum_{j}(1-<q_{A}^{j},q_{B}^{j}>^{2}),\n(1)\nwhere\n𝐱\nA\n\\mathbf{x}_{A}\nand\n𝐱\nB\n\\mathbf{x}_{B}\nare poses from embodiment\nA\nA\nand\nB\nB\n, respectively. The index\nj\nj\ndenotes the number of joints within the body part being compared—for instance,\nj\n=\n2\nj=2\nfor a typical arm (lower and upper joints). The term\nq\nA\nj\nq_{A}^{j}\nrepresents the quaternion of the\nj\nj\n-th joint in embodiment\nA\nA\n, and\n<\n⋅\n,\n⋅\n>\n<\\cdot,\\cdot>\ndenotes the dot product between two quaternions.\nTo ensure consistency across embodiments with differing arm lengths and coordinate frames, we first express each EE position relative to the shoulder frame, and then normalize it by the corresponding arm length. The EE-based similarity is computed as:\nD\ne\n​\ne\n​\n(\n𝐱\nA\n,\n𝐱\nB\n)\n=\n‖\np\nA\ne\n​\ne\n−\np\nB\ne\n​\ne\n‖\n2\n,\nD_{ee}(\\mathbf{x}_{A},\\mathbf{x}_{B})=||p_{A}^{ee}-p_{B}^{ee}||_{2},\n(2)\nwhere\np\nA\ne\n​\ne\np_{A}^{ee}\nand\np\nB\ne\n​\ne\np_{B}^{ee}\ndenote the normalized positions of embodiments\nA\nA\nand\nB\nB\n, respectively.\nFor the arm latent subspaces (LA and RA), we compute the similarity as a weighted sum of rotation and EE-based distances:\nS\nk\n​\n(\n𝐱\nA\n,\n𝐱\nB\n)\n=\nD\nR\n​\n(\n𝐱\nA\n,\n𝐱\nB\n)\n+\nω\n​\nD\ne\n​\ne\n​\n(\n𝐱\nA\n,\n𝐱\nB\n)\n\\displaystyle S_{k}(\\mathbf{x}_{A},\\mathbf{x}_{B})=D_{R}(\\mathbf{x}_{A},\\mathbf{x}_{B})+\\omega D_{ee}(\\mathbf{x}_{A},\\mathbf{x}_{B})\n(3)\nfor\nk\n∈\n{\nL\n​\nA\n,\nR\n​\nA\n}\n,\n\\displaystyle\\text{for}\\quad k\\in\\{LA,RA\\},\nwhere\nω\n\\omega\nis a tunable weight balancing the importance of orientation versus end-effector positioning.\nFor the remaining body parts (TK, LL, RL), we rely solely on the rotation-based metric:\nS\nk\n​\n(\n𝐱\nA\n,\n𝐱\nB\n)\n=\nD\nR\n​\n(\n𝐱\nA\n,\n𝐱\nB\n)\n\\displaystyle S_{k}(\\mathbf{x}_{A},\\mathbf{x}_{B})=D_{R}(\\mathbf{x}_{A},\\mathbf{x}_{B})\n(4)\nfor\nk\n∈\n{\nT\n​\nK\n,\nL\n​\nL\n,\nR\n​\nL\n}\n.\n\\displaystyle\\text{for}\\quad k\\in\\{TK,LL,RL\\}.\nThis modular similarity framework allows us to more accurately align motions between embodiments with different capabilities, ultimately improving the quality of cross-embodiment motion retargeting.\nII-C\nLearning a Unified Latent Space\nTo enable motion retargeting across a diverse set of embodiments, we train a unified latent representation shared among humans and multiple robot types. This shared latent space is optimized using contrastive learning applied independently to each decoupled body-part subspace, as described in Section\nII-B\n. The key idea is to embed semantically similar motions—regardless of embodiment—closely together in their respective latent subspaces.\nFigure\n1\npresents an overview of the model architecture used to learn this unified latent space. The system comprises a human encoder\nE\nh\nE_{h}\n, a cross-embodiment encoder\nE\nX\nE_{X}\n, a cross-embodiment decoder\nD\nX\nD_{X}\n, and robot-specific embedding layers (\nE\nr\n,\nD\nr\nE_{r},D_{r}\n). Since robots may have differing numbers of joints, their raw pose vectors\n𝐱\n∈\nℝ\nJ\n×\nn\n\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{J\\times n}\nvary in dimensionality. To handle this variation, each robot pose is first passed through a learnable robot-specific embedding layer, which transforms it into a fixed-size high-dimensional vector. This transformation ensures consistent input dimensionality to the shared encoder.\nAfter embedding, robot poses are processed by the shared encoder, which outputs five latent vectors, corresponding to five latent decoupled subspaces (LA, RA, TK, LL, RL). Similarly, the human encoder network\nE\nh\nE_{h}\nmaps the human poses into five latent vectors, each aligned with one of the body-part-specific subspaces.\nD\nX\nD_{X}\nthen reconstructs the latent vectors back into a shared embedding space, which is finally projected back to robot-specific joint angles by\nD\nr\nD_{r}\n.\nDuring training, each batch of data contains pose samples from both human and robot domains. For each subspace, we apply contrastive learning using randomly sampled triplets composed of poses from any embodiment. A triplet consists of an anchor sample, a positive sample that is semantically similar, and a negative sample that is less similar.\nLet (\nz\ni\no\n,\nz\nj\n+\nz_{i}^{o},z_{j}^{+}\n,\nz\nk\n−\nz_{k}^{-}\n) represent a triplet in a given subspace, where\nz\ni\no\nz_{i}^{o}\nis the anchor,\nz\nj\n+\nz_{j}^{+}\nis the positive sample, and\nz\nk\nz_{k}\nis the negative sample. We train the latent space using the Triplet Loss\n[\n8\n]\n, defined as:\nℒ\ncontrastive\n=\n∑\n𝒮\n∑\n(\nz\ni\no\n,\nz\nj\n+\n,\nz\nk\n−\n)\n∈\n𝒮\nmax\n⁡\n(\n‖\nz\ni\no\n−\nz\nj\n+\n‖\n2\n−\n‖\nz\ni\no\n−\nz\nk\n−\n‖\n+\nα\n,\n0\n)\n,\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{contrastive}}=\\sum_{\\mathcal{S}}\\sum_{(z_{i}^{o},z_{j}^{+},z_{k}^{-})\\in\\mathcal{S}}\\\\\n\\max(||z_{i}^{o}-z_{j}^{+}||_{2}-||z_{i}^{o}-z_{k}^{-}||+\\alpha,0),\n(5)\nwhere\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\ndenotes each subspace, and\nα\n\\alpha\nis a margin hyperparameter that enforces a minimum separation between the positive and negative samples. Intuitively, the loss encourages the positive sample to lie closer to the anchor than the negative sample by at least\nα\n\\alpha\n. In our experiments, we set\nα\n=\n0.05\n\\alpha=0.05\n.\nTo train the decoder\nD\nX\nD_{X}\nto reconstruct robot motions from the latent space accurately, we apply a reconstruction loss\nℒ\nrec\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{rec}}\n. This loss ensures that the decoded output closely matches the original input robot pose. Given an input robot pose\n𝐱\nA\n\\mathbf{x}_{A}\nfrom embodiment\nA\nA\n, and the reconstructed pose\n𝐱\n^\nA\n\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}_{A}\n, the reconstruction loss is defined as:\nℒ\nrec\n=\n‖\n𝐱\nA\n−\n𝐱\n^\nA\n‖\n2\n.\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{rec}}=||\\mathbf{x}_{A}-\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}_{A}||_{2}.\n(6)\nHere,\nA\nA\ndenotes any robotic embodiment. The reconstruction loss serves to regularize the latent-to-pose mapping, ensuring that the decoder maintains fidelity to the input motion during encoding and decoding.\nHowever, for human motion data,\n𝐱\nH\n\\mathbf{x}_{H}\n, direct reconstruction is not possible due to the lack of paired human-to-robot data. Instead, we employ a latent consistency loss\nℒ\nltc\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{ltc}}\n, inspired by the circular loss introduced in ImitationNet\n[\n17\n]\n. This loss encourages the decoder to generate robot motions that remain faithful to the original human motion when viewed in the latent space.\nSpecifically,\nℒ\nltc\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{ltc}}\nmeasures the discrepancy between the original human latent representation\nE\nh\n​\n(\n𝐱\nH\n)\nE_{h}(\\mathbf{x}_{H})\nand the latent representation obtained by re-encoding the decoded robot motion:\nE\nX\n​\n(\nD\nX\n​\n(\nE\nh\n​\n(\n𝐱\nH\n)\n)\n)\nE_{X}(D_{X}(E_{h}(\\mathbf{x}_{H})))\n. The loss is formally defined as:\nℒ\nltc\n=\n‖\nE\nh\n​\n(\n𝐱\nH\n)\n−\nE\nX\n​\n(\nD\nX\n​\n(\nE\nh\n​\n(\n𝐱\nH\n)\n)\n)\n‖\n2\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{ltc}}=||E_{h}(\\mathbf{x}_{H})-E_{X}(D_{X}(E_{h}(\\mathbf{x}_{H})))||_{2}\n(7)\nThis latent consistency objective ensures that motions generated by decoding human embeddings can be re-encoded to yield representations close to the original human latent space. It effectively aligns the human and robot domains, thereby improving the quality of cross-embodiment motion retargeting.\nFinally, to enhance the temporal consistency of retargeted motions, we introduce a temporal loss\nℒ\ntemporal\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{temporal}}\n, which focuses on aligning the end-effector velocities between human and robot motions. Specifically, we consider two consecutive human poses,\n𝐱\nH\nt\n\\mathbf{x}_{H}^{t}\nand\n𝐱\nH\nt\n+\n1\n\\mathbf{x}_{H}^{t+1}\n, and their corresponding retargeted robot poses,\n𝐱\nA\nt\n\\mathbf{x}_{A}^{t}\nand\n𝐱\nA\nt\n+\n1\n\\mathbf{x}_{A}^{t+1}\n, where\nA\nA\ndenotes a target robot embodiment.\nFrom these consecutive frames, we compute the human hand velocity\nv\nH\nhand\nv_{H}^{\\text{hand}}\nand robot EE velocity\nv\nA\nee\nv_{A}^{\\text{ee}}\n. The temporal loss is then defined as the L2 distance between these velocity vectors:\nℒ\ntemporal\n=\n‖\nv\nH\nhand\n−\nv\nA\nee\n‖\n2\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{temporal}}=||v_{H}^{\\text{hand}}-v_{A}^{\\text{ee}}||_{2}\n(8)\nTo train the model end-to-end, we combine all previously defined objectives into a single weighted loss function:\nℒ\ntotal\n=\nλ\nc\n​\nℒ\ncontrastive\n+\nλ\nrec\n​\nℒ\nrec\n+\nλ\nl\n​\nt\n​\nc\n​\nℒ\nltc\n+\nλ\nt\n​\ne\n​\nm\n​\np\n​\nℒ\ntemporal\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{total}}=\\lambda_{c}\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{contrastive}}+\\lambda_{\\text{rec}}\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{rec}}+\\lambda_{ltc}\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{ltc}}+\\lambda_{temp}\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{temporal}}\n(9)\nwhere we empirically set\nλ\nc\n=\n10\n,\nλ\nrec\n=\n5\n,\nλ\nl\n​\nt\n​\nc\n=\n1\n,\nλ\nt\n​\ne\n​\nm\n​\np\n=\n0.1\n\\lambda_{c}=10,\\lambda_{\\text{rec}}=5,\\lambda_{ltc}=1,\\lambda_{temp}=0.1\n.\nBy minimizing\nℒ\ntotal\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{total}}\n, the model learns a unified latent space in which motions can be accurately and smoothly retargeted across a wide range of embodiments. This shared space enables us to train control policies within the latent domain and seamlessly deploy them across multiple robots, regardless of their structural differences.\nII-D\nAdding New Robots\nOur architecture is designed to facilitate efficient scalability by maintaining a shared latent space and shared network components across all embodiments. While the core encoders and decoder—\nE\nh\n,\nE\nX\nE_{h},E_{X}\n, and\nD\nX\nD_{X}\n—are jointly trained across multiple robots and humans, each robot retains its own learnable embedding layer to account for embodiment-specific differences.\nThis modular design enables seamless integration of new robots into the system. Specifically, once the shared components of the model are pre-trained, we can freeze the networks\nE\nh\n,\nE\nX\nE_{h},E_{X}\n, and\nD\nX\nD_{X}\n, and train only the embedding layers (\nE\nr\n,\nD\nr\nE_{r},D_{r}\n) for the new robot. This approach allows the new robot to align with the existing latent space without requiring retraining of the entire model, reducing computational cost and training time.\nAs a result, our framework supports scalable deployment to new robotic platforms while preserving the generalization and robustness of the unified control policy learned in the latent space.\nFigure 2:\nGoal-conditioned Latent-Space Robot Control.\nOur c-VAE framework learns to model goal-directed motion dynamics in our shared latent space purely from human demonstrations. During training, the model conditions on the current latent pose\nz\nt\nz_{t}\nand the average EE velocity toward a sampled goal\nv\n¯\ne\n​\ne\n\\overline{v}_{ee}\nto predict the latent displacement\nd\nt\nd_{t}\n. At inference time,\nv\n¯\ne\n​\ne\n\\overline{v}_{ee}\nis derived from the current robot pose and the user-specified goal position and time horizon. The decoder then generates the latent displacement\nd\n^\nt\n\\hat{d}_{t}\nusing\nz\nt\nz_{t}\n,\nv\n¯\ne\n​\ne\n\\overline{v}_{ee}\n, and sampled latent noise. This autoregressive process iteratively updates the latent state, enabling smooth and goal-directed motion generation across robot embodiments.\nII-E\nLatent-Space Robot Control\nWith our cross-embodiment retargeting framework in Fig.\n1\n, human and robot motions are projected into a unified latent space, where semantically similar movements across embodiments are encoded close together. This shared representation enables a high-level abstraction of robot control: rather than specifying joint commands, robot behavior can be modulated by traversing this latent space.\nTo exploit this capability, we propose a goal-conditioned motion generation policy that operates directly in the latent space and is trained exclusively on human data. Crucially, this policy can be deployed to multiple robot platforms without any further fine-tuning. We focus on a practical and widely applicable control objective in robotics—generating arm movements that guide the robot’s EE to reach a desired goal position.\nWe model this task using the c-VAE architecture, where the motion generation is guided by control signals. During training, we utilize human hand positions to extract the goal signal. Due to the modular structure of our decoupled latent space (see Sec.\nII-B\n), the policy targets only the relevant subspace (e.g., LA or RA), allowing efficient and focused learning for arm control.\nTraining proceeds as follows: from a human motion sequence\n𝐗\nH\n1\n:\nT\n\\mathbf{X}_{H}^{1:T}\n, we sample three frames:\n𝐱\nH\nt\n,\n𝐱\nH\nt\n+\n1\n\\mathbf{x}_{H}^{t},\\mathbf{x}_{H}^{t+1}\nand a future goal frame\n𝐱\nH\nt\nG\n\\mathbf{x}_{H}^{t_{G}}\n. Hand positions\np\nhand\nt\np_{\\text{hand}}^{t}\nand\np\nhand\nt\nG\np_{\\text{hand}}^{t_{G}}\nare extracted from these frames, and the average velocity vector toward the goal is computed as\nv\n¯\nee\n=\np\nhand\nt\nG\n−\np\nhand\nt\nt\nG\n−\nt\n.\n\\overline{v}_{\\text{ee}}=\\frac{p_{\\text{hand}}^{t_{G}}-p_{\\text{hand}}^{t}}{t_{G}-t}.\nv\n¯\nee\n\\overline{v}_{\\text{ee}}\nserves as an intention signal, providing directional guidance for generating future motion. Concurrently, the human encoder\nE\nh\nE_{h}\nencodes the poses\n𝐱\nH\nt\n\\mathbf{x}_{H}^{t}\nand\n𝐱\nH\nt\n+\n1\n\\mathbf{x}_{H}^{t+1}\ninto latent representation\nz\nt\nz_{t}\nand\nz\nt\n+\n1\nz_{t+1}\n, respectively.\nRather than reconstructing absolute poses, our model learns to predict the latent displacement vector\nd\nt\n=\nz\nt\n+\n1\n−\nz\nt\nd_{t}=z_{t+1}-z_{t}\n, which captures motion dynamics between consecutive frames. Predicting these deltas also benefits from the inherent inductive biases of sequential datasets, which contribute to more sample-efficient learning and improved generalizability, as noted in prior work\n[\n5\n,\n13\n,\n15\n]\n. The design of architecture (in Fig.\n2\n), conditioning on\nz\nt\nz_{t}\nand\nv\n¯\ne\n​\ne\n\\overline{v}_{ee}\n, ensures that motion generation is informed both by the current pose and by the goal-directed intention.\nThe overall training objective for the c-VAE consists of a reconstruction loss and a KL divergence regularization:\nℒ\ncvae\n=\nℒ\nreconstruction\n+\nλ\nKL\n​\nℒ\nKL\n.\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{cvae}}=\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{reconstruction}}+\\lambda_{\\text{KL}}\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{KL}}.\n(10)\nThe reconstruction loss,\nℒ\nreconstruction\n=\n‖\nd\nt\n−\nd\n^\nt\n‖\n2\n2\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{reconstruction}}=||d_{t}-\\hat{d}_{t}||_{2}^{2}\n, encourages the faithful reproducing of human motions.\nThe KL divergence term,\nℒ\nKL\n=\nD\nKL\n(\n𝒩\n(\n0\n,\nI\n)\n|\n|\n𝒩\n(\nμ\n,\nσ\n)\n)\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{KL}}=D_{\\text{KL}}(\\mathcal{N}(0,I)||\\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\sigma))\n, aligns the encoder’s output distribution with a standard Gaussian prior.\nμ\n\\mu\nand\nσ\n\\sigma\nare the predicted mean and variance of the latent distribution. We set\nλ\nK\n​\nL\n=\n10\n−\n4\n\\lambda_{KL}=10^{-4}\nto ensure that the regularization term supports, but does not dominate the reconstruction objective.\nAt inference time, we deploy the learned policy to generate robot motions toward a user-specified goal. The process begins with the user providing a target EE position\np\ne\n​\ne\nT\np_{ee}^{T}\nand a time horizon\nT\nT\n. Given the current EE position\np\ne\n​\ne\nt\np_{ee}^{t}\nat time step\nt\nt\n, we compute the goal-directed velocity vector as\nv\n¯\ne\n​\ne\n=\np\ne\n​\ne\nT\n−\np\ne\n​\ne\nt\nT\n−\nt\n\\overline{v}_{ee}=\\frac{p_{ee}^{T}-p_{ee}^{t}}{T-t}\n.\nSimultaneously, the current robot pose is encoded into the latent space as\nz\nt\nz_{t}\n. The decoder, conditioned on\nz\nt\nz_{t}\nand the intention vector\nv\n¯\ne\n​\ne\n\\overline{v}_{ee}\n, along with a sampled latent noise, predicts the latent displacement\nd\n^\nt\n\\hat{d}_{t}\nthat represents the transition to the next state. The next latent representation is then computed as\nz\nt\n+\n1\n=\nz\nt\n+\nd\n^\nt\nz_{t+1}=z_{t}+\\hat{d}_{t}\n.\nImportantly, at each step, the intention vector\nv\n¯\ne\n​\ne\n\\overline{v}_{ee}\nis dynamically updated based on the predicted EE position and the original goal, enabling the policy to adapt to real-time changes and maintain goal-oriented motion. This process is executed in an autoregressive fashion, iteratively generating a sequence of latent states that are subsequently decoded into robot joint configurations.\nIII\nExperiments\nThis section is organized as follows: We begin by outlining the implementation details to support reproducibility. Next, we introduce the baseline methods. Finally, we present a comprehensive evaluation of our approach on multiple robots with different morphologies.\nIII-A\nTechnical Implementation\nIII-A\n1\nLearning a Unified Latent Space\nThe two encoders (\nE\nh\nE_{h}\nand\nE\nX\nE_{X}\n) and the decoder (\nD\nX\nD_{X}\n) in our architecture are implemented using multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). Each MLP consists of 8 fully connected layers, with 256 neurons per layer. We use Exponential Linear Units (ELU)\n[\n3\n]\nas the activation function for intermediate layers and apply a Tanh activation at the output layer to constrain the output range. Each latent subspace is 16-dimensional, with values bounded between -1 and 1.\nTo handle embodiment-specific differences in pose dimensionality, each robot is equipped with a learnable embedding layer\nE\nr\nE_{r}\nthat projects its joint space into a 1024-dimensional feature space. An inverse embedding layer\nD\nr\nD_{r}\nis used to map this shared representation back into the robot-specific joint space, enabling the reconstruction of the original pose.\nIII-A\n2\nLatent-Space Robot Control\nSimilarly, the encoder and decoder networks in the c-VAE are also implemented as MLPs, each comprising 8 linear layers. Every layer is followed by an ELU activation, except for the output layer, which uses no activation function to allow unbounded outputs. The encoder outputs a 32-dimensional latent distribution, representing the mean and variance parameters of a Gaussian distribution from which latent variables are sampled during training.\nIII-A\n3\nTraining Details\nWe developed and trained our method using the PyTorch framework. For optimization, we use Adam\n[\n11\n]\nwith a constant learning rate of\n10\n−\n3\n10^{-3}\n. Our models are trained with a batch size of\n10\n5\n10^{5}\non an NVIDIA A4000 GPU.\nIII-B\nDatasets\nWe use the HumanML3D dataset\n[\n7\n]\n, which contains 29,224 diverse human motion sequences comprising over 4 million human poses. Notably, our approach does not require any robot data collection. Instead, we sample robot joint configurations uniformly at random from their respective joint spaces during training and compute the corresponding robot poses using forward kinematics (FK). For FK computation, we employ PyTorch-Kinematics\n[\n20\n]\n, which efficiently parallelizes FK calculations on the GPU using only robot URDFs. This design enables the entire training pipeline—from data sampling to neural network updates—to be executed entirely on GPUs, thereby improving training efficiency. At each training step, over\n10\n5\n10^{5}\nnew robot poses are sampled and immediately discarded after updating the networks, ensuring diverse and unbiased exposure without requiring dataset storage. Over the course of training, this results in billions of robot poses per embodiment. This large-scale synthetic sampling enables our model to explore the robot’s kinematic space comprehensively and supports the formation of a smooth and expressive latent space.\nIII-C\nBaselines\nTo assess the performance of our framework, we evaluate it across three key settings: human-to-robot motion retargeting, cross-embodiment generalization, and robot end-effector control. Each baseline is selected to highlight specific aspects of our method’s capability—representational efficiency, embodiment scalability, and control precision.\nIII-C\n1\nHuman-to-Robot Motion Retargeting\nWe first compare our method against ImitationNet\n[\n17\n]\n, a deep-learning-based approach originally designed to retarget motions from human demonstrations to a dual-arm TIAGo++ robot. Unlike our unified latent space that supports multiple embodiments, ImitationNet learns a shared space from humans for one single robot. For a fair evaluation, we train individual ImitationNet models for each target robot, such as human-to-JVRC and human-to-H1. This comparison highlights the scalability and generalization of our shared latent representation, which enables joint learning across all robots in a single model.\nIII-C\n2\nCross-Embodiment Motion Retargeting\nTo evaluate the effect of our decoupled latent space, we compare it against a monolithic, whole-body latent representation trained under an otherwise identical setup. We hypothesize that separating the latent space into semantically aligned subspaces (e.g., arms, legs, trunk) provides better modularity and embodiment-\ninvariance—critical when mapping motions between diverse\nmorphologies. By toggling between the decoupled and coupled\nvariants of our framework, we isolate and quantify the impact\nof this architectural choice.\nIII-D\nQuantitative and Qualitative Evaluation\nTo evaluate our models on diverse and unseen motions, we split the HumanML3D dataset into\n80\n%\n80\\%\nof training data and\n20\n%\n20\\%\nof testing data.\nIII-D\n1\nMetrics\nTo quantitatively evaluate motion retargeting quality and goal-reaching performance, we define the following metrics:\n•\nRotation Similarity (RS)\nmeasures the rotational consistency of body limb orientations across different embodiments. Specifically, it computes the average angular distance between corresponding joints as defined in Eq.\n1\n.\n•\nNormalized Distance Similarity (NDS)\nevaluates the spatial alignment of end-effector (or hand) positions after normalization. To account for scale differences across embodiments, all positions are transformed into the shoulder-local coordinate frame and normalized by arm length, as detailed in Sec.\nII-B\n. The formal definition is given in Eq.\n2\n.\n•\nNormalized Velocity Similarity (NVS)\nassesses the similarity of end-effector velocities between retargeted and reference motions. This metric is crucial for validating the consistency of latent dynamics across embodiments, as it reflects the correspondence between motion intent and execution. NVS is computed as in Eq.\n8\n.\n•\nDistance to Goal (DTG)\nmeasures the absolute position distance of the end-effector in goal-conditioned tasks. It is defined as the Euclidean distance between the predicted end-effector position at the final frame and the user-specified goal location.\nIII-D\n2\nMotion Retargeting\nRotation Similarity (in degree)\nNormalized Distance Similarity\nNormalized Velocity Similarity\nsource\ntarget\nImitationNet\nours\n(coupled)\nours\n(decoupled)\nImitationNet\nours\n(coupled)\nours\n(decoupled)\nImitationNet\nours\n(coupled)\nours\n(decoupled)\nHuman\nTIAGo++\n0.7183\n4.2622\n\\ul\n3.8293\n0.1325\n\\ul\n0.0492\n0.0401\n0.3762\n\\ul\n0.1252\n0.1071\nH1\n0.6483\n2.1268\n\\ul\n1.0947\n0.1081\n\\ul\n0.0353\n0.0263\n0.2881\n\\ul\n0.1116\n0.0962\nNAO\n0.6685\n4.2371\n\\ul\n2.7097\n0.1596\n\\ul\n0.0635\n0.0566\n0.3682\n\\ul\n0.1604\n0.1448\nJVRC\n0.5792\n1.9812\n\\ul\n1.4631\n0.1006\n\\ul\n0.0289\n0.0288\n0.2383\n\\ul\n0.1001\n0.0862\nJVRC\nH1\n-\n0.6962\n0.4699\n-\n0.0232\n0.0206\n-\n0.0822\n0.0869\nH1\nNAO\n-\n2.7630\n1.8093\n-\n0.0502\n0.0511\n-\n0.1316\n0.1300\nTIAGo++\nJVRC\n-\n3.3615\n2.2428\n-\n0.0402\n0.0360\n-\n0.1058\n0.1040\nTABLE I:\nMotion Retargeting.\nComparison of different imitation models. Notice that ImitationNet trains an individual model for each human-to-robot mapping, while our method trains a unified model across all embodiments. We also conduct ablation study on the latent space decomposition for cross-embodiment retargeting.\nWe evaluate our method and the baselines on the testing dataset using the defined metrics. Our focus is on assessing cross-embodiment motion retargeting performance across four distinct robot platforms: TIAGo++, H1, NAO, and JVRC. These robots span a range of morphologies, from mobile-base bimanual arms (TIAGo++) to fully legged humanoids (JVRC), introducing varying kinematic constraints and control challenges. Detailed specifications of each robot are provided in Appendix\nA\n.\nFor the baseline ImitationNet\n[\n17\n]\n, a separate model is trained for each robot, while our method trains a single unified model across human and all robot embodiments. Table\nI\npresents a quantitative comparison of our approach against the baselines. Our method significantly outperforms existing techniques in terms of end-effector position and velocity accuracy, both of which are critical for enabling precise goal-conditioned control policies in the learned latent space.\nHowever, we observe a decline in rotational accuracy when using a shared latent space across all embodiments. This degradation arises due to intrinsic differences in robot kinematics: for instance, TIAGO is restricted to arm motions, whereas H1 and NAO possess legged locomotion but have limited trunk mobility compared to humans or JVRC. To mitigate this, we adopt a decoupled latent space design, which not only recovers rotational performance comparable to ImitationNet but also yields further improvements in EE trajectory fidelity.\nFurthermore, the use of a unified model across diverse embodiments enables our method to support motion transfer among different robots via the shared latent space. This capability demonstrates the potential of our approach to scale to multi-robot systems, where a single policy can be used to control multiple robots. We explore this application further in the next section.\nIII-D\n3\nAdding New Robots\nsource\ntarget\nRS (degree)\nNDS\nNVS\nHuman\nG1\n1.2124\n0.0396\n0.1284\nATLAS\n1.4008\n0.0336\n0.1272\nKinova\n3.4249\n0.0491\n0.0764\nATLAS\nJVRC\n0.9862\n0.0329\n0.1218\nJVRC\nG1\n1.1174\n0.0398\n0.1245\nTIAGO\nATLAS\n1.1471\n0.0455\n0.1288\nKinova\nTIAGo++\n1.5011\n0.0372\n0.0902\nTABLE II:\nAdding New Robots.\nWe assess the generalizability and scalability of our latent space by introducing three new robots—G1, ATLAS, and Kinova. For new robots, we freeze most networks (\nE\nh\n,\nE\nX\nE_{h},E_{X}\n, and\nD\nX\nD_{X}\n) and only train the robot-specific embedding layers (\nE\nr\nE_{r}\nand\nD\nr\nD_{r}\n).\nTo assess the scalability of our method in incorporating new robots, we demonstrate that minimal additional effort is required—specifically, only a single robot-specific embedding layer needs to be learned, while the rest of the network remains fixed.\nOur model is first trained end-to-end on the four primary robots introduced earlier. Once training is complete, we freeze the core networks (\nE\nh\nE_{h}\n,\nE\nX\nE_{X}\n, and\nD\nX\nD_{X}\n) and train only the robot-specific embedding layers (\nE\nr\nE_{r}\nand\nD\nr\nD_{r}\n) for the newly added robots—ATLAS, G1, and Kinova Gen3. This approach dramatically reduces the training time, requiring only about 15 minutes, compared to several hours for full retraining from scratch. We evaluate these new robots on both human-to-robot and robot-to-robot motion retargeting tasks, with results presented in Table\nII\n. Across all evaluation metrics, the performance of the new robots matches that of the original robots trained end-to-end. These results highlight the generalizability of the learned latent space across different embodiments, making our method highly scalable and adaptable to new platforms with minimal retraining.\nIII-D\n4\nVisual Resemblance\nFigure 3:\nComparison of visual resemblance.\nWe retarget various dynamic human motions onto different robots (H1, JVRC, and TIAGo, from left to right), and compare different retargeting models. The result shows that both ImitationNet and our method with a decoupled latent space obtain high-quality visual resemblance. Our method trains a single model on all robots, while ImitationNet overfits each robot to a separate model.\nFigure 4:\nCross-embodiment Motion Retargeting.\nWe translate motions between any embodiments, and the results showcase the capability of our method, capturing the motion semantics across diverse embodiments.\nA primary goal of motion retargeting is to transfer motions across different embodiments while maintaining their visual fidelity. In Fig.\n3\n, we present a qualitative comparison between our method and the baseline using dynamic, visually expressive motions. The top row depicts the original human motions to be retargeted. ImitationNet delivers high visual similarity by training a dedicated model for each robot. In contrast, our method using a coupled shared latent space struggles to accurately capture leg motions across embodiments. However, when the latent space is decoupled by body segments, our approach matches the visual quality of ImitationNet while retaining the benefit of a shared, generalizable latent space across all robots.\nFigure\n4\npresents additional results demonstrating our method’s ability to retarget motions between different robots. The results show that, despite variations in embodiment, the shared latent representation effectively preserves the visual resemblance of the original motion. Notably, our method achieves high-quality motion transfer across robots with significantly different kinematic structures—for example, from the legged H1 robot to the mobile-based TIAGO, and from TIAGO back to the legged ATLAS robot.\nIII-D\n5\nLatent-Space Robot Control\nDistance to Goal (in cm)\nTIAGO\nH1\nNAO\nJVRC\nG1\nATLAS\nc-VAE\n1.14\n0.44\n0.13\n0.45\n0.42\n0.56\nTABLE III:\nWe evaluate the latent-space policy on multiple robots and showcase the performance of goal reaching for each robot.\nFigure 5:\nLatent-Space Multi-Robot Control.\nA single policy controls the latent space to enable each robot to reach arbitrary goal positions (blue) from various starting poses (green). Intermediate waypoints along the generated trajectories are shown in purple.\nA key objective of our shared latent space is to enable the learning of control policies that generalize across different robot embodiments. Following the method described in Section\nII-E\n, we train a latent-space control policy conditioned on the robot’s end-effector goal position. We evaluate this policy using two criteria: (i) the distance to goal (DTG) metric, which measures the accuracy of reaching the specified EE goal positions, and (ii) computational efficiency. Owing to the decoupled structure of our latent representation, each body segment can be independently controlled. In this study, we focus on learning a policy for controlling the right arm.\nTo assess the performance of the learned policy, we conduct 1,000 experiments per robot, each with a randomly sampled initial pose and goal EE position. The results, summarized in Table\nIII\n, show that our latent policy enables control of the robotic EE across diverse platforms and achieves sub-centimeter accuracy. Additionally, our latent-space robot control framework is also computationally efficient, supporting control frequencies of approximately 100 Hz.\nFigure\n5\nvisualizes representative trajectories generated by our latent-space control policy across different robots. Each robot starts from a random initial pose, with EE positions indicated by green spheres. The randomly sampled goal positions are shown in blue, and intermediate waypoints—shown in purple—highlight the smoothness of the generated motion trajectories, further demonstrating the effectiveness of our learned controller.\nIII-D\n6\nMotion Editing within Latent Space\nFigure 6:\nLatent-Space Editing.\nOur latent space enables motion editing in the latent space, such as composing new motions by combining partial body movements from different sources.\nFigure 7:\nMotion Editing.\nOur method can synthesize new motions for any target embodiment from different source embodiments by composing their shared latent space.\nThanks to the decoupled design of our latent space, our method enables a range of versatile applications. One example is independent control of individual body segments, as demonstrated in Figure\n5\n. Additionally, the learned latent space supports motion editing capabilities, such as composing new motions by combining partial movements from different sources. Figure\n6\nillustrates this functionality: in the shown example, we synthesize a new ATLAS motion by stitching together the arm motion from TIAGO with the trunk and leg motion from ATLAS—seamlessly blended within the latent space. Figure\n7\nshowcases additional examples of motion synthesis, where target-domain motions are generated by combining source-domain motions from different embodiments. The high-quality visual consistency of the composed motions highlights the effectiveness of our cross-domain motion retargeting and the strong decoupling capabilities of the learned shared latent space.\nIII-D\n7\nAblation Study\nHuman-to-TIAGo++\nHuman-to-JVRC\nw\n,\nλ\nc\nw,\\lambda_{c}\nRS\nNDS\nNVS\nRS\nNDS\nNVS\n1.0\n,\n5.0\n1.0,5.0\n4.2224\n0.0487\n0.1077\n1.6395\n0.0367\n0.0919\n1.0\n,\n𝟏𝟎\n\\mathbf{1.0},\\mathbf{10}\n3.8293\n0.0401\n0.1071\n1.4631\n0.0288\n0.0862\n1.0\n,\n15\n1.0,15\n3.6749\n0.0482\n0.1111\n1.3970\n0.0323\n0.0942\n0.5\n,\n10\n0.5,10\n3.0738\n0.0460\n0.1020\n1.1512\n0.0349\n0.0880\n1.5\n,\n10\n1.5,10\n3.2215\n0.0495\n0.1100\n1.1814\n0.0306\n0.1010\nTABLE IV:\nAblation Study on Hyperparameter\n.\nw\nw\nand\nλ\nc\n\\lambda_{c}\nare essential parameters for the similarity metric in Eq.\n3\nand objective function in Eq.\n9\n.

To fully evaluate the capabilities of our method, we conduct different experiments: human-to-robot and robot-to-robot motion retargeting, and robot control through our latent space.\nFigure\n8\nshows real-time robot teleoperation using only an RGB camera with our method. The dual-armed TIAGo-SEA robot is teleoperated to perform object pick-and-place by throwing items into a trash bin. We also demonstrate bimanual object transfer, highlighting the utility of dual-arm teleoperation enabled by our approach.\nIn Figure\n10\n, the motion of the Kinova arm is transferred to the TIAGo-SEA’s right arm. Since the Kinova is mounted in a tabletop setting, we transform its base link to correspond to the right shoulder, thereby aligning the workspaces of the two robots.\nFurthermore, Figure\n9\ndemonstrates our method’s ability to control robots directly in the shared latent space. The Kinova robot is controlled to pick up objects and drop them into a glass. Successful execution of these tasks requires precise end-effector control, which highlights the effectiveness of our method.\nIII-E\nDiscussion and Future Work\nIn this work, we proposed an unsupervised learning approach to construct a cross-embodiment latent space in which semantically similar motions are closely aligned, regardless of the source embodiment. Leveraging this shared representation, we introduced a c-VAE framework to learn goal-conditioned latent control policies from only human data, and the policies can be directly deployed across diverse robotic platforms.\nCurrently, our motion retargeting is trained on the HumanML3D dataset, which contains human motions in the SMPL model. Since the SMPL model does not capture hand movements, it considers the hands as part of the forearms. As a result, due to the missing hand motion in the SMPL, hand motion retargeting is not handled in this paper, limiting applications that require fine-grained teleoperation. In future work, we plan to address this limitation by using existing (or collecting) hand datasets to incorporate human hand imitation, enhancing the robot’s latent control policy to support a wide range of manipulation tasks.\nFigure 11:\nMapping among different embodiments.\nFigure 12:\nVisualization of Latent Space.\nAfter dimension reduction with PCA, we visualize the projected latent space trajectories of the retargeted walking motion from multiple robots.\nIV\nConclusions\nCross-embodiment control is a critical capability for enabling scalable and flexible multi-robot systems. In this work, we introduced a two-stage framework to address this challenge: (1) learning a shared latent space that encodes semantically similar motions across diverse embodiments, and (2) training control policies within this space that can be deployed on a wide range of robots without further adaptation.\nIn the first stage, we leverage contrastive learning to build a generalizable and scalable latent representation across multiple robot and human embodiments. We validate this latent space through extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on both human-to-robot and robot-to-robot motion retargeting. When adding new robots to our shared latent space, only a lightweight robot-specific embedding layer needs to be trained, while the rest of the model remains frozen. Despite this minimal adaptation, newly added robots achieve performance comparable to those trained end-to-end, demonstrating the generalizability of the learned latent space. As a result, trained control policies can be directly deployed on new robots, significantly enhancing the efficiency of multi-robot system management.\nIn the second stage, we introduce a goal-conditioned control method in the latent space using a c-VAE architecture. This policy is trained exclusively on human motions and can be directly deployed across multiple robots. Our experiments show that the learned policy achieves accurate end-effector control, achieving sub-centimeter errors across different platforms.\nOverall, our method demonstrates a promising path toward unified, scalable, and adaptable control across diverse robot embodiments.\nAppendix A\nRobots with different embodiments\nTABLE V:\nHuman body parts that robots can mimic\nRobot\nArms\nTrunk\nLegs\nArm-Ratio\nATLAS\n✓\n✓\n✓\n1.00\nH1\n✓\n✗\n✓\n0.90\nG1\n✓\n✗\n✓\n1.43\nJVRC\n✓\n✓\n✓\n0.78\nNAO\n✓\n✗\n✓\n0.53\nTIAGo++\n✓\n✗\n✗\n1.16\nKinova\n✓\n✗\n✗\n1.59\nWe evaluate our method on six robots that span a wide range of morphologies, from mobile-based bimanual platforms to fully bipedal humanoids. Figure\n11\nvisualizes the kinematic mappings between different embodiments, while Table\nV\nsummarizes the capabilities of each robot. For example, the ATLAS robot has fully actuated arms, legs, and a trunk, whereas the TIAGo robot is limited to arm movements only. The final column in the table reports the arm ratio—defined as the length ratio between the forearm and upper arm—for each robot. These ratios vary significantly, ranging from 0.53 to 1.43, reflecting the morphological diversity of the platforms and highlighting the inherent challenges of developing a unified multi-robot control framework.\nAppendix B\nLatent Space Visualization\nTo better understand the structure of the shared latent space constructed across multiple embodiments, we visualize the projected latent trajectories using principal component analysis (PCA), as shown in Fig.\n12\n. An example walking motion (top) is first retargeted to several robots, such as the JVRC. The resulting robot motions are then encoded into the shared latent space, and their projected trajectories are plotted in Fig.\n12\n(bottom). The visualization demonstrates the alignment and consistency of the motion representations across different embodiments within the shared latent space.\nReferences\n[1]\nS. Choi, M. Pan, and J.

    "preview_text": "We present a scalable framework for cross-embodiment humanoid robot control by learning a shared latent representation that unifies motion across humans and diverse humanoid platforms, including single-arm, dual-arm, and legged humanoid robots. Our method proceeds in two stages: first, we construct a decoupled latent space that captures localized motion patterns across different body parts using contrastive learning, enabling accurate and flexible motion retargeting even across robots with diverse morphologies. To enhance alignment between embodiments, we introduce tailored similarity metrics that combine joint rotation and end-effector positioning for critical segments, such as arms. Then, we train a goal-conditioned control policy directly within this latent space using only human data. Leveraging a conditional variational autoencoder, our policy learns to predict latent space displacements guided by intended goal directions. We show that the trained policy can be directly deployed on multiple robots without any adaptation. Furthermore, our method supports the efficient addition of new robots to the latent space by learning only a lightweight, robot-specific embedding layer. The learned latent policies can also be directly applied to the new robots. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables robust, scalable, and embodiment-agnostic robot control across a wide range of humanoid platforms.\n\n\\useunder\n\\ul\nLearning a Unified Latent Space for Cross-Embodiment Robot Control\nYashuai Yan\n1\n, Dongheui Lee\n1,2\n1\nYashuai Yan and Dongheui Lee are with Autonomous Systems Lab, Technische Universität Wien (TU Wien), Vienna, Austria (e-mail:\n{yashuai.yan, dongheui.lee}@tuwien.ac.at\n).\n2\nDongheui Lee is also with the Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics (DLR), German Aerospace Center, Wessling, Germany.\nAbstract\nWe present a scalable framework for cross-embodiment humanoid robot control by learning a shared latent representation that unifies motion across humans",

            "answer": "## 论文核心分析\n\n### **核心问题**\n论文旨在解决**跨具身机器人控制**的核心挑战：如何为形态、自由度、运动学约束差异巨大的不同人形机器人平台（如单臂、双臂、双足机器人），建立一个统一的控制框架，使得一个策略能够不经修改直接部署到所有机器人上。\n\n### **核心创新点**\n论文提出了一个**两阶段、基于解耦共享潜空间的框架**，其创新性主要体现在以下四个方面：\n\n1.  **解耦的、模块化的潜空间架构**\n    - **创新**： 将整体潜空间按身体部位（左臂、右臂、躯干、左腿、右腿）解耦为五个独立的子空间。\n    - **价值**： 解决了不同机器人形态（如有的有腿无躯干，有的只有手臂）导致的映射模糊问题。这种模块化设计允许对局部运动模式进行细粒度对齐，并能灵活处理非对称或部分肢体结构的机器人。\n\n2.  **定制化的对比学习相似性度量**\n    - **创新**： 针对不同身体部位设计不同的相似性计算方式。对于手臂，结合了**关节旋转相似性**和**末端执行器位置相似性**（公式3）；对于躯干和腿部，则仅使用关节旋转相似性（公式4）。\n    - **价值**： 这种混合度量更符合机器人任务需求（如操作任务重视末端精度，腿部运动重视姿态模仿），显著提升了跨具身运动重定向的质量和实用性。\n\n3.  **在共享潜空间中训练目标条件控制策略**\n    - **创新**： 使用**条件变分自编码器**，**仅利用人类运动数据**，在共享潜空间中训练一个预测潜状态位移的目标导向策略。\n    - **价值**： 策略在抽象的、与具身无关的潜空间中运行，因此训练完成后可直接部署到任何已编码到该空间中的机器人上，无需针对任何机器人进行微调，实现了真正的“一次训练，多处部署”。\n\n4.  **高效、可扩展的新机器人集成方法**\n    - **创新**： 系统核心组件（编码器、解码器）在多个机器人上预训练后固定。添加新机器人时，**仅需训练一个轻量级的、机器人特定的嵌入层**，将新机器人的姿态映射到共享特征空间。\n    - **价值**： 极大降低了扩展到新机器人平台的成本和耗时（论文中仅需约15分钟），使框架具备高度的可扩展性，适应不断增长的机器人形态。\n\n### **解决方案（方法论）**\n论文通过一个清晰的两阶段流程解决上述问题：\n\n**第一阶段：学习统一的潜空间**\n- **输入**： 人类运动数据 + 通过正向动力学从机器人URDF随机采样生成的大量机器人姿态（无需真实机器人演示数据）。\n- **过程**：\n    1.  通过机器人特定嵌入层将不同维度的原始姿态映射到统一维度。\n    2.  使用**对比学习**，基于定制的相似性度量，训练编码器网络，使得语义相似的运动（无论来自人还是哪种机器人）在对应的解耦潜子空间中位置接近。\n    3.  通过组合**对比损失、重建损失、潜空间一致性损失、时序损失**来优化整个编码-解码架构。\n- **输出**： 一个能够对齐人类与多种机器人运动的、解耦的共享潜空间。\n\n**第二阶段：在潜空间中训练控制策略**\n- **输入**： **仅人类运动数据**。从中提取当前姿态、目标姿态，并计算指向目标的平均末端速度作为“意图”信号。\n- **过程**：\n    1.  使用c-VAE框架，以当前潜状态 `z_t` 和意图信号 `v_ee` 为条件，预测下一时刻的潜状态位移 `d_t`。\n    2.  训练目标是准确重建人类运动中的潜位移。\n- **部署**：\n    1.  给定机器人的当前姿态和目标末端位置，计算意图信号。\n    2.  将当前机器人姿态编码到潜空间。\n    3.  c-VAE解码器根据当前潜状态和意图信号，预测潜位移，从而更新潜状态。\n    4.  将新的潜状态解码回机器人关节空间，生成控制命令。\n    5.  此过程以自回归方式运行，生成平滑、目标导向的运动轨迹。\n\n### **实际价值与意义**\n- **规模化机器人控制**： 为管理形态各异的机器人舰队提供了统一、高效的控制接口，降低了部署和维护成本。\n- **数据效率与可迁移性**： 策略训练仅需人类数据，避免了为每个机器人收集大量演示数据的难题；策略具备开箱即用的跨平台迁移能力。\n- **灵活性与新应用**： 解耦的潜空间支持**运动编辑**（如组合不同机器人的身体部位运动）和**模块化控制**（独立控制手臂或腿部），拓展了机器人运动生成的可能性。\n- **硬件验证**： 论文在TIAGo和Kinova等真实机器人上成功演示了实时遥操作、目标到达和抓取放置任务，证明了方法的实用性和精度。\n\n**总结**： 该论文的核心贡献是提出了一个**可扩展、与具身无关的机器人学习与控制范式**。它通过构建一个结构化的共享语义空间，将复杂的跨平台控制问题转化为在该空间中的轨迹规划问题，为实现通用机器人控制迈出了重要一步。",

            "answer": "## 论文发展脉络梳理\n\n本文《Learning a Unified Latent Space for Cross-Embodiment Robot Control》是作者团队在跨具身机器人控制与运动重定向方向上系列工作的最新进展。其核心发展脉络可以梳理为以下几个关键阶段，每个阶段都针对特定瓶颈进行了改进，并逐渐分化出不同的研究方向。\n\n### 发展脉络与核心改进\n\n#### 第一阶段：从特定配对数据到无监督学习（解决数据瓶颈）\n- **早期工作（如 [4, 9, 1]）**：专注于从人类到**单一特定机器人**或动画角色的运动重定向。这些方法严重依赖**手动收集的配对数据集**（即同一动作的人类演示和对应的机器人关节轨迹）。这极大地限制了方法的可扩展性和实用性。\n- **关键改进**：后续工作（如Choi等人[2]）引入了**自监督的配对数据生成技术**，自动化了构建跨域对应关系的过程，减少了对昂贵配对数据的依赖。这标志着从“数据驱动”向“学习驱动”的转变。\n\n#### 第二阶段：从单一域到共享潜在空间（解决表示对齐问题）\n- **前作 ImitationNet [17]（本文直接基础）**：本文作者团队之前的工作。它采用**对比学习**方法，为**人类和一个特定的机器人**（如TIAGo++）学习一个**共享的潜在空间**。其贡献在于实现了高质量、平滑的**无监督**人机运动重定向。\n- **关键改进与本文的关联**：\n    - **局限性**：ImitationNet 学习的共享空间是**“一对一”**的（人类↔特定机器人）。要控制N个不同的机器人，就需要训练N个独立的模型，不具备可扩展性。\n    - **本文的飞跃**：本文将共享潜在空间的概念从“一对一”**扩展为“一对多”乃至“多对多”**。目标是学习一个能**统一容纳多种机器人具身形态**的单一潜在空间，从而实现真正的跨具身控制。\n\n#### 第三阶段：从整体潜在空间到解耦潜在空间（解决形态多样性问题）\n- **前期共享空间方法（包括ImitationNet）的局限**：它们使用**单一的、整体的潜在向量**来表示全身运动。当源域和目标域的形态结构差异巨大时（例如，有腿的机器人 vs. 只有手臂的机器人），这种整体表示会导致模糊甚至错误的映射。\n- **本文的核心技术创新**：\n    - **解耦的潜在空间架构**：将潜在空间按身体部位（左臂、右臂、躯干、左腿、右腿）**解耦为五个独立的子空间**。每个子空间专注于学习局部运动模式。\n    - **定制化的相似性度量**：针对不同身体部位设计不同的对比学习相似度函数。例如，对于手臂，结合了**关节旋转相似度**和**末端执行器位置相似度**；对于腿和躯干，则主要依赖旋转相似度。这使得模型能更精细地处理不同机器人之间肢体长度、自由度数量的差异。\n\n#### 第四阶段：从运动重定向到潜在空间控制（解决控制泛化问题）\n- **前期工作重心**：主要集中在**运动重定向**本身，即如何将一种形态的运动转换为另一种形态的运动。控制策略通常需要在目标机器人上单独训练或调整。\n- **本文的系统性贡献**：\n    - **两阶段框架**：明确将“学习共享空间”（阶段一）和“在共享空间内学习控制策略”（阶段二）解耦。\n    - **具身无关的控制策略**：在阶段二，**仅使用人类运动数据**，在已学好的共享潜在空间中训练一个**目标条件化的控制策略**（采用c-VAE）。由于策略在“抽象”的潜在空间中操作，一旦训练完成，即可**直接部署到任何已编码进该空间的机器人上，无需任何微调**。这实现了“一次训练，多处部署”。\n\n### 着重发展的几个不同方向\n\n基于上述脉络，该领域的研究逐渐分化为以下几个重点方向：\n\n1.  **表示学习与对齐方向**：\n    - **目标**：如何更好地学习跨域（人-机、机-机）的、与任务相关的、域不变的表示。\n    - **演进**：从手工特征 → 深度学习特征 → 使用对比学习/对抗学习等技术的**共享潜在空间**。本文通过**解耦设计和定制化度量**，将此方向推向了更精细、更能处理形态异构的新高度。\n\n2.  **数据效率与可扩展性方向**：\n    - **目标**：减少对配对数据的依赖，并快速适应新机器人。\n    - **演进**：从需要大量配对数据 → 自监督生成配对数据 → **完全无监督学习**（如ImitationNet）。本文进一步提出了**模块化可扩展框架**：增加新机器人时，只需训练一个轻量级的**机器人特定嵌入层**，而共享编码器/解码器和控制策略全部冻结。这极大地提升了系统的可扩展性和部署效率。\n\n3.  **控制策略泛化方向**：\n    - **目标**：使在单一数据源（如人类）上训练的策略能直接控制多种机器人。\n    - **演进**：从为每个机器人训练独立策略 → 学习域自适应策略 → **在抽象表示空间（潜在空间）中学习策略**。本文明确提出了“**在共享潜在空间内学习控制**”的范式，将控制问题从具体的关节空间提升到语义运动空间，是实现强泛化的关键。\n\n4.  **系统应用与多功能性方向**：\n    - **目标**：超越单一的重定向任务，开发统一框架支持多种应用。\n    - **本文的展示**：基于解耦的潜在空间，本文不仅实现了运动重定向和跨具身控制，还演示了**潜在空间运动编辑**（如组合不同机器人的身体部位运动）、**实时遥操作**、以及**精确的末端执行器目标到达控制**。这表明该框架正朝着成为一个**多功能的跨具身机器人编程与控制平台**发展。\n\n### 总结\n本文的发展脉络清晰地展示了一条从**解决特定、数据密集型问题**，到构建**通用、可扩展、数据高效框架**的技术路径。每一步改进都直指前序工作的核心痛点：数据瓶颈、表示不对齐、泛化能力差、扩展成本高。通过引入**解耦的共享潜在空间**和**潜在空间内控制**这两个核心创新，本文成功地将研究方向从“如何更好地模仿”推进到了“如何用一个统一模型控制和协调多种机器人”，为 scalable multi-robot systems 奠定了重要的理论基础。",

            "answer": "好的，作为一名专业的学术论文分析助手，我将对这篇题为《Learning a Unified Latent Space for Cross-Embodiment Robot Control》的论文进行深入分析，并详细阐述其提出的关键技术方法。\n\n## 论文核心技术创新与价值分析\n\n本文的核心目标是解决**跨具身机器人控制**的难题，即开发一个统一的控制框架，能够直接应用于形态各异（如单臂、双臂、腿式人形）的机器人平台，而无需为每个机器人重新训练策略。其核心创新在于**两阶段框架**：1）学习一个解耦的、统一的潜在空间来对齐不同“身体”（人类与各种机器人）的运动语义；2）在该潜在空间中直接训练目标驱动的控制策略，并实现零样本迁移。\n\n**实际价值**在于极大地提升了机器人系统的**可扩展性**和**部署效率**。新机器人只需训练一个轻量级的嵌入层即可融入系统，并立即复用所有已训练好的高级控制策略，这对于管理异构机器人集群、快速集成新机器人平台具有重大意义。\n\n---\n\n## 关键技术方法详述\n\n以下表格详细说明了论文提出的各项关键技术方法、数学原理及具体参数。\n\n| 方法模块 | 技术细节与数学原理 | 具体参数与说明 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **1. 解耦的潜在空间架构** | **原理**：为解决不同机器人形态（如有的有腿无躯干，有的只有手臂）导致的运动映射模糊问题，作者没有使用单一的潜在空间表示全身运动，而是将身体解耦为五个独立部分：**左臂(LA)、右臂(RA)、躯干(TK)、左腿(LL)、右腿(RL)**。每个部分拥有自己独立的潜在子空间。这样，对于缺少某些身体部位的机器人（如TIAGO只有手臂），在训练和推理时就只激活相关的子空间（LA, RA），避免了缺失部分对表示的干扰。 | - **潜在子空间数量**：5个 (LA, RA, TK, LL, RL) <br> - **每个子空间维度**：16维 <br> - **输出范围**：通过Tanh激活函数约束在[-1, 1]区间内 |\n| **2. 定制化的对比学习相似度度量** | **原理**：在对比学习中，需要度量不同“身体”姿态之间的相似性以拉近语义相似的样本。作者为不同身体部位设计了定制化的相似度函数 `S_k`：<br> 1. **基于旋转的度量 (用于TK, LL, RL)**：计算对应关节旋转（四元数）的差异。公式为：<br> `D_R(𝐱_A, 𝐱_B) = Σ_j (1 - <q_A^j, q_B^j>^2)` <br> 其中 `<·,·>` 是四元数点积，值越接近1表示旋转越相似。<br> 2. **混合度量 (用于LA, RA)**：结合旋转和末端执行器位置信息，这对机械臂操作至关重要。公式为：<br> `S_k(𝐱_A, 𝐱_B) = D_R(𝐱_A, 𝐱_B) + ω * D_ee(𝐱_A, 𝐱_B)` <br> 其中 `D_ee(𝐱_A, 𝐱_B) = ‖p_A^ee - p_B^ee‖_2`。末端位置 `p^ee` 会转换到肩部坐标系并**用臂长归一化**，以消除尺寸和坐标系差异。 | - **权重 ω**：用于平衡旋转与末端位置的重要性。论文通过消融实验选定 `ω = 1.0`。<br> - **归一化**：关键步骤，确保了不同尺寸机器人的末端位置在度量上具有可比性。 |\n| **3. 统一潜在空间训练的总损失函数** | **原理**：通过组合多个损失项，以端到端的方式训练编码器-解码器网络，同时优化潜在空间的对齐性、重建精度和时间一致性。<br> **总损失函数**：<br> `ℒ_total = λ_c * ℒ_contrastive + λ_rec * ℒ_rec + λ_ltc * ℒ_ltc + λ_temp * ℒ_temporal` <br> - **ℒ_contrastive (对比损失)**：使用三元组损失 (Triplet Loss)。对于每个子空间，拉近锚点样本 `z_i^o` 与正样本 `z_j^+` 的距离，推远其与负样本 `z_k^-` 的距离，间隔为 `α`：<br> `max(‖z_i^o - z_j^+‖_2 - ‖z_i^o - z_k^-‖_2 + α, 0)` <br> - **ℒ_rec (重建损失)**：确保机器人姿态编码后再解码能准确还原。`ℒ_rec = ‖𝐱_A - 𝐱̂_A‖_2` <br> - **ℒ_ltc (潜在一致性损失)**：针对无配对数据的人类姿态，确保人类姿态编码、解码为机器人姿态、再编码后，其潜在表示与最初的人类潜在表示一致。`ℒ_ltc = ‖E_h(𝐱_H) - E_X(D_X(E_h(𝐱_H)))‖_2` <br> - **ℒ_temporal (时间损失)**：对齐人类手部速度与机器人末端执行器速度，保证运动动态的一致性。`ℒ_temporal = ‖v_H^hand - v_A^ee‖_2` | - **损失权重**：`λ_c = 10, λ_rec = 5, λ_ltc = 1, λ_temp = 0.1` <br> - **三元组损失间隔 α**：`α = 0.05` <br> - **关键创新**：`ℒ_ltc` 解决了**无需配对数据**即可进行人→机器人运动重定向的核心难题。 |\n| **4. 高效集成新机器人** | **原理**：利用模块化设计实现可扩展性。系统核心组件——人类编码器 `E_h`、跨具身编码器 `E_X`、跨具身解码器 `D_X`——在多个机器人上**联合训练后固定**。每个机器人独有的、用于将其关节空间与共享特征空间互相映射的轻量级嵌入层 `E_r` 和 `D_r` 则是可学习的。**添加新机器人时，只需冻结核心网络，单独训练该机器人的 `E_r` 和 `D_r` 即可**，使其姿态能够与已有的统一潜在空间对齐。 | - **嵌入层维度**：将机器人原始姿态映射到1024维的共享特征空间。<br> - **训练成本**：仅需约15分钟（对比从头训练的数小时），实现了高效的扩展。 |\n| **5. 潜在空间中的目标条件控制策略 (c-VAE)** | **原理**：在训练好的潜在空间中，使用条件变分自编码器学习一个仅基于**人类数据**的运动生成策略。策略学习预测潜在空间的位移 `d_t = z_{t+1} - z_t`，条件是基于当前潜在状态 `z_t` 和指向目标的意图信号 `v̄_ee`。<br> **训练**：从人类运动序列中采样当前帧 `x_H^t`、下一帧 `x_H^{t+1}` 和未来目标帧 `x_H^{t_G}`。计算平均目标速度作为条件：`v̄_ee = (p_hand^{t_G} - p_hand^{t}) / (t_G - t)`。c-VAE编码器以 `z_t` 和 `v̄_ee` 为输入，输出潜在分布参数(μ, σ)，采样得到噪声变量，解码器据此预测位移 `d̂_t`。<br> **推理**：用户给定机器人末端目标位置 `p_ee^T` 和时间范围 `T`，计算当前目标速度 `v̄_ee = (p_ee^T - p_ee^t) / (T - t)`。结合当前机器人姿态编码 `z_t`，输入解码器预测 `d̂_t`，以自回归方式更新潜在状态：`z_{t+1} = z_t + d̂_t`，最终解码为机器人关节指令。 | - **c-VAE潜在维度**：32维（表示高斯分布的均值和方差）<br> - **KL散度权重**：`λ_KL = 10^{-4}`（较小的权重优先保证重建精度）<br> - **控制频率**：约100 Hz，满足实时性要求。<br> - **关键优势**：策略在**人类潜在空间**中训练，但可直接部署到**任何**已对齐的机器人上，实现**零样本跨具身控制**。 |\n| **6. 无需机器人数据的数据生成策略** | **原理**：整个训练过程**不需要任何真实的机器人运动数据**。对于机器人数据，作者在每次训练迭代中，从各机器人的关节空间**均匀随机采样**关节角，然后利用机器人的URDF模型和正向运动学库（PyTorch-Kinematics）在GPU上实时计算对应的末端姿态。这些采样姿态在用于计算损失后即被丢弃。",

            "answer": "## 论文主要局限性分析\n\n基于对论文内容的深入阅读，以下是该方法目前存在的主要局限性：\n\n- **缺乏精细手部动作的模仿能力**\n    - 论文使用的训练数据集（HumanML3D，基于SMPL人体模型）**不包含独立的手部运动数据**。在SMPL模型中，手部被视为前臂的一部分。\n    - 这导致方法**无法处理需要精细手指操作的任务**，例如抓握、操作小物体等，限制了其在需要高精度遥操作或灵巧操控场景中的应用。\n\n- **运动重定向的旋转精度存在权衡**\n    - 如表I所示，与为每个机器人单独训练模型的基线方法（ImitationNet）相比，本文的统一潜在空间方法在**旋转相似性（RS）指标上有所下降**。\n    - 这种下降源于不同机器人形态（如有的有躯干，有的没有）之间的固有差异。尽管通过解耦潜在空间的设计缓解了此问题，但在统一表示与特定形态的最优精度之间仍存在内在张力。\n\n- **依赖合成数据与理想化假设**\n    - 模型训练所需的机器人数据完全通过**从关节空间均匀采样并利用前向运动学（FK）计算位姿**来生成，并未使用真实的机器人运动数据。\n    - 这种方法假设机器人的工作空间可以被充分、均匀地探索，且**未考虑实际机器人的动力学约束、执行器极限、自碰撞以及与环境交互的物理特性**。在真实硬件上部署时，可能需要进行额外的安全检查和轨迹优化。\n\n- **控制策略的单一性与任务局限**\n    - 目前展示的潜在空间控制策略**主要针对单臂末端执行器（EE）的位置到达任务**（Goal-conditioned reaching）。\n    - 对于更复杂的任务，如**双手协调、全身平衡控制、动态运动或与复杂环境的交互**，论文尚未验证其方法的有效性。策略是在潜在空间中通过预测位移的自回归方式生成，其长期生成的稳定性和复杂性任务的性能有待进一步探究。\n\n## 未来可能的改进方向\n\n针对上述局限性，论文在讨论部分（III-E）及分析基础上，可延伸出以下未来工作方向：\n\n- **集成手部动作与精细操作**\n    - **收集或利用现有的手部运动数据集**，扩展人体表示以包含独立的手部关节。\n    - 在解耦潜在空间中**为手部新增专门的子空间**，并设计相应的相似性度量（如指尖位置、物体相对位姿）。\n    - 这将使学习到的控制策略能够支持**抓取、工具使用等精细操作任务**，大幅提升方法的实用性。\n\n- **融合物理约束与安全保证**\n    - 在潜在空间解码为机器人关节轨迹后，或直接在潜在空间训练中，**引入机器人动力学、扭矩限制、自碰撞避免等约束**。\n    - 可以探索**安全层（Safety Layer）或约束优化**，确保生成的动作用于真实机器人时是可行且安全的。这能减少仿真到实物的差距（Sim2Real Gap）。\n\n- **扩展任务范围与复杂技能学习**\n    - 将目标条件控制策略**从简单的点对点到达，扩展到更复杂的技能**，如物体操纵序列、避障运动、全身协调任务（如搬运）。\n    - 研究如何将**高层任务规划与潜在空间低层控制相结合**，实现多步骤任务的执行。\n\n- **探索更高效的数据利用与在线适应**\n    - 研究**少量真实机器人示范数据**如何用于对潜在空间或机器人特定嵌入层进行微调，以更好地适应特定硬件或环境。\n    - 探索**在线学习或自适应机制**，使系统能在任务执行过程中根据传感器反馈（如力觉、触觉）调整潜在空间中的轨迹。\n\n- **跨形态泛化的进一步理论分析**\n    - 对**解耦潜在空间为何能更好地实现跨形态对齐**进行更深入的理论分析或可解释性研究。\n    - 探索如何**自动确定最优的身体部位划分方式**，或如何处理形态差异极大的机器人（如非人形机器人）之间的映射问题。\n\n**总结**：该论文提出了一个具有高度创新性和实用价值的跨形态控制框架，其核心优势在于**可扩展性和统一性**。当前的主要局限在于**数据表示的粒度（无手部）和对理想化仿真数据的依赖**。未来的工作自然围绕**增强精细操作能力、注入物理现实性、扩展任务复杂性**这三个核心方向展开，以推动该方法从实验室演示走向复杂的实际机器人应用。",
