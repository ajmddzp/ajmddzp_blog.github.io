By grafting robotic control heads onto pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), these systems inherit the rich semantic reasoning and open-world generalization capabilities of large-scale internet data. This unified approach promises a robot that can not only recognize a \"coffee mug\" but also understand the instruction \"place the mug on the coaster\" and execute the corresponding motor commands.\nHowever, a fundamental tension lies at the heart of current VLA architectures: the\nmisalignment between the optimization objectives of semantic pre-training and robotic fine-tuning.\nPre-trained VLMs are originally optimized for general semantic understanding and dialogue. In contrast, during VLA fine-tuning, the backbone is repurposed to provide precise, spatially-grounded conditioning for the Action Expert to enable precise robotic control. Forcing a single VLM backbone to satisfy these divergent objectives simultaneously inevitably precipitates \"\ncatastrophic forgetting\n\"\n(Hancock\net al.\n,\n2025b\n; Zhang\net al.\n,\n2026\n; Zhou\net al.\n,\n2025\n; Fang\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\n, where the model sacrifices its general linguistic capabilities to adapt to the specialized demands of robotic actuation. More critically, this catastrophic forgetting undermines the fundamental premise of the VLA paradigm, which aims to leverage the general world understanding acquired during VLM pre-training to enable generalized robotic control. However, current fine-tuning methodologies paradoxically strip the VLM of this very capability.\nTo resolve this conflict, we draw inspiration from the biological principle of hemispheric lateralization, where the human brain allocates distinct cognitive functions to specialized hemispheres—logic and language to the left, spatial attention and motor coordination to the right. We propose that VLA models should mimic this decoupling. By separating general semantic understanding from embodied action estimation, we cY-an achieve a system that is both cognitively capable and physically skillful.\nFigure 1:\nArchitectural comparison between Vanilla VLA and\nTwinBrainVLA\n.\nIn this paper, we introduce\nTwinBrainVLA\n, a novel VLA framework that orchestrates two isomorphic VLM pathways via an asymmetric dual-stream joint training strategy. Structurally, our model consists of a \"Left Brain\" and a \"Right Brain\". The Left Brain is a frozen, pre-trained VLM that retains robust open-world knowledge and instruction following capabilities. The Right Brain, initialized with the same architecture, is fully trainable and specialized for embodied perception. These two streams are seamlessly fused through a Asymmetric Mixture-of-Transformers (\nAsyMoT\n) mechanism, which allows for joint attention over hidden states without sharing parameters. Crucially, the specialized representations from the Right Brain serve as the primary condition for our action expert utilizing flow-matching for precise action generation. This design ensures that the action expert receives spatially rich, task-aligned embeddings from the Right Brain, while the Left Brain explicitly preserves the model’s general semantic understanding capabilities.\nOur contributions are threefold:\n•\nWe propose\nTwinBrainVLA\n, the first VLA architecture to explicitly decouple general semantic understanding and embodied perception via an asymmetric dual-stream design, resolving the training conflict inherent in single-backbone VLAs.\n•\nWe introduce the\nAsymmetric Mixture-of-Transformers (AsyMoT)\nmechanism for the information interaction of two isomorphic VLM pathways to build the VLA backbone, and employ an asymmetric parameter freezing strategy to achieve the joint training of the dual models.\n•\nExtensive comparative experiments and evaluations on the SimplerEnv and RoboCasa benchmarks, demonstrates the effectiveness of the\nTwinBrainVLA\narchitecture, the AsyMoT mechanism, and the proposed training strategy.\n2\nRelated Work\nMultimodal understanding.\nThe landscape of computer vision and natural language processing has been revolutionized by Vision Language Models (VLMs)\n(Liu\net al.\n,\n2023\n; Bai\net al.\n,\n2025b\n,\na\n)\n. By seamlessly integrating visual encoders with Large Language Models (LLMs) through sophisticated projection layers or adapter modules\n(Jiang\net al.\n,\n2025a\n)\n, these models exhibit emergent abilities in holistic scene understanding, visual question answering (VQA), and complex math reasoning. Given the inherent limitations of general-purpose VLMs in spatial perception\n(Xiao\net al.\n,\n2026\n; Dang\net al.\n,\n2025\n; Zhang\net al.\n,\n2025b\n; Chen\net al.\n,\n2025\n; Yang\net al.\n,\n2025c\n)\n, recent studies have increasingly focused on employing post-training strategies to enhance spatial intelligence\n(Yang\net al.\n,\n2025a\n; Tan\net al.\n,\n2025\n; Zhou\net al.\n,\n2026\n; Zhu\net al.\n,\n2025\n; Li\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\nand construct specialized embodied foundation models tailored for embodied scenarios\n(Team\net al.\n,\n2025a\n; Yang\net al.\n,\n2025a\n; Hao\net al.\n,\n2025\n; Lin\net al.\n,\n2025c\n)\n.\nVision-Language-Action (VLA) Models.\nBuilding upon the zero-shot generalization and rich semantic priors of VLMs, VLA models have emerged as a scalable paradigm for embodied intelligence\nPertsch\net al.\n(\n2025\n); Zheng\net al.\n(\n2025a\n); Wen\net al.\n(\n2025\n); Shukor\net al.\n(\n2025\n); Zheng\net al.\n(\n2025b\n); Lin\net al.\n(\n2025b\n); Cai\net al.\n(\n2026\n)\n. By fine-tuning pre-trained VLMs on large-scale robotic manipulation datasets, these models learn to map multimodal instructions and observations to low-level control signals\n(Jiang\net al.\n,\n2025b\n; Fan\net al.\n,\n2025\n; Zhai\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\n. To mitigate the degradation of general conversational skills during VLA training, recent approaches have integrated general visual-dialogue datasets\n(Mazzaglia\net al.\n,\n2025\n; Yang\net al.\n,\n2025b\n; Hancock\net al.\n,\n2025a\n; Zhou\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\nand reasoning mechanisms into the VLA framework\n(Zawalski\net al.\n,\n2025\n; Yin\net al.\n,\n2025\n; Lin\net al.\n,\n2025a\n; Qu\net al.\n,\n2025a\n; Ye\net al.\n,\n2025\n; Huang\net al.\n,\n2025\n; Guo\net al.\n,\n2025\n; Lee\net al.\n,\n2025\n; Huang\net al.\n,\n2026\n)\n.\n3\nMotivation: Catastrophic Forgetting in VLA Models\nStandard Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models typically adopt a transfer learning paradigm. Formally, let a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM) be parameterized by\nθ\npre\n\\theta_{\\text{pre}}\n, which has been aligned on massive internet-scale image-text pairs to maximize the likelihood of generating semantic text responses\ny\ny\ngiven an image\nv\nv\nand instruction\nx\nx\n. To adapt this backbone for robotic manipulation, the model is fine-tuned on a robotic demonstration dataset\n𝒟\nrobot\n=\n{\n(\nv\n,\nx\n,\na\n)\ni\n}\ni\n=\n1\nN\n\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{robot}}=\\{(v,x,a)_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{N}\n, where\na\na\nrepresents the robot’s action (e.g., end-effector pose or joint angles). The training objective shifts to minimizing the action prediction loss\nℒ\naction\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{action}}\n:\nθ\n∗\n=\narg\n⁡\nmin\nθ\n​\n∑\n(\nv\n,\nx\n,\na\n)\n∈\n𝒟\nrobot\n−\nlog\n⁡\nP\n​\n(\na\n|\nv\n,\nx\n;\nθ\n)\n,\n\\theta^{*}=\\arg\\min_{\\theta}\\sum_{(v,x,a)\\in\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{robot}}}-\\log P(a|v,x;\\theta),\n(1)\ninitialized with\nθ\n=\nθ\npre\n\\theta=\\theta_{\\text{pre}}\n.\nWhile this process effectively imparts manipulation skills—enabling the model to control servos and execute tasks—it introduces a critical side effect known as\ncatastrophic forgetting\n. The distribution of\n𝒟\nrobot\n\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{robot}}\ndiffers fundamentally from the diverse visual-linguistic data seen during pre-training\n(Kachaev\net al.\n,\n2025\n; Hancock\net al.\n,\n2025a\n; Zhang\net al.\n,\n2025a\n)\n. As the parameters\nθ\n\\theta\nare updated to minimize the high-frequency spatial error in action space, the delicate semantic alignment established in\nθ\npre\n\\theta_{\\text{pre}}\nis often overwritten. Consequently, the resulting VLA model suffers from a severe degradation in its original capabilities: it loses the ability to follow complex open-ended instructions, fails to describe visual scenes accurately, and exhibits weakened general semantic reasoning. This phenomenon turns the VLM backbone from a \"generalist\" into a \"specialist\", sacrificing its linguistic brain to gain a robotic body.\n4\nMethod:\nTwinBrainVLA\nIn this section, we present\nTwinBrainVLA\n, a unified VLA framework designed to disentangle high-level semantic reasoning from fine-grained sensorimotor control. As illustrated in Figure\n2\n, our architecture operates on an asymmetric dual-stream paradigm to resolve the \"catastrophic forgetting\" dilemma. The framework comprises three core components: (1) a frozen\n\"Left Brain\"\nthat preserves open-world visual-linguistic knowledge; (2) a trainable\n\"Right Brain\"\nthat specializes in embodied motor control; and (3) a\nFlow-Matching Action Expert\nthat generates precise continuous actions. The two brains interact via a novel\nAsymmetric Mixture-of-Transformers (AsyMoT)\nmechanism, enabling the specialist to leverage generalist semantics without corrupting them. We detail the Dual-VLM architecture and AsyMoT fusion strategy in Sec.\n4.1\n, describe the flow-matching policy formulation in Sec.\n4.2\n, and finally present our joint-training objective in Sec.\n4.3\n.\nFigure 2:\nThe framework of\nTwinBrainVLA\n.\n(a) Overall Architecture.\nThe model features an Asymmetric Mixture-of-Transformers design composed of two distinct pathways: a frozen \"Left Brain\" (Generalist) for semantic reasoning and a trainable \"Right Brain\" (Specialist) for embodied motor control. The Right Brain fuses visual, textual, and proprioceptive state inputs to provide conditioning for the Action Expert, which utilizes a Flow-Matching algorithm to denoise continuous robotic actions.\n(b) Asymmetric MoT Mechanism (AsyMoT).\nThrough causal self-attention, the trainable Right Brain attends to the frozen Key-Value (KV) pairs of the Left Brain, enabling the transfer of general semantic knowledge to the robotic control policy without catastrophic forgetting.\n4.1\nAsymmetric Dual-VLM as Backbone\nThe backbone of\nTwinBrainVLA\nconsists of two parallel Vision-Language Models (VLMs), denoted as the \"Left Brain\" (\nℳ\nL\n\\mathcal{M}_{L}\n) and the \"Right Brain\" (\nℳ\nR\n\\mathcal{M}_{R}\n). Both streams are initialized with identical pre-trained weights (e.g., Qwen3-VL series\n(Bai\net al.\n,\n2025a\n)\n) but serve distinct roles during training.\nDual-Stream Inputs and State Encoding.\nThe input to the system comprises a visual observation\n𝐈\n\\mathbf{I}\n, a natural language instruction\n𝐓\n\\mathbf{T}\n, and the robot’s proprioceptive state\n𝐬\n∈\nℝ\nd\ns\n\\mathbf{s}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_{s}}\n(e.g., joint angles and end-effector pose).\nThe\nLeft Brain\nfunctions as a pure semantic generalist. It receives only the vision and language tokens:\n𝐇\nL\n0\n=\n[\n𝒱\n​\n(\n𝐈\n)\n;\n𝒯\n​\n(\n𝐓\n)\n]\n,\n\\mathbf{H}_{L}^{0}=[\\mathcal{V}(\\mathbf{I});\\mathcal{T}(\\mathbf{T})],\n(2)\nwhere\n𝒱\n\\mathcal{V}\nand\n𝒯\n\\mathcal{T}\nrepresent the vision encoder and text tokenizer, respectively.\nIn contrast, the\nRight Brain\nis responsible for embodied control and must be grounded in the robot’s physical state. To achieve this, we introduce a lightweight\nState Encoder\nϕ\n\\phi\n, modeled as a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which projects the low-level proprioceptive state\n𝐬\n\\mathbf{s}\ninto the VLM’s embedding space. These state tokens are appended to the multimodal input sequence:\n𝐇\nR\n0\n=\n[\n𝒱\n​\n(\n𝐈\n)\n;\n𝒯\n​\n(\n𝐓\n)\n;\nϕ\n​\n(\n𝐬\n)\n]\n.\n\\mathbf{H}_{R}^{0}=[\\mathcal{V}(\\mathbf{I});\\mathcal{T}(\\mathbf{T});\\phi(\\mathbf{s})].\n(3)\nThis design ensures that the Right Brain explicitly attends to the robot’s current configuration, a critical requirement for closed-loop control.\nAsymmetric Mixture-of-Transformers (AsyMoT).\nThe core innovation of our backbone lies in how these two streams interact. We propose the AsyMoT mechanism to fuse general semantic knowledge into the robotic control stream.\nLet\n𝐇\nL\nl\n\\mathbf{H}_{L}^{l}\nand\n𝐇\nR\nl\n\\mathbf{H}_{R}^{l}\ndenote the hidden states of the Left and Right Brains at layer\nl\nl\n, respectively.\nThe Left Brain remains\nfrozen\nduring training. Its self-attention mechanism operates independently to preserve pre-trained general capabilities:\n𝐇\nL\nl\n+\n1\n=\nAttn\n​\n(\nQ\nL\nl\n,\nK\nL\nl\n,\nV\nL\nl\n)\n+\nFFN\n​\n(\n𝐇\nL\nl\n)\n,\n\\mathbf{H}_{L}^{l+1}=\\text{Attn}(Q_{L}^{l},K_{L}^{l},V_{L}^{l})+\\text{FFN}(\\mathbf{H}_{L}^{l}),\n(4)\nwhere\nQ\n,\nK\n,\nV\nQ,K,V\nare derived from\n𝐇\nL\nl\n\\mathbf{H}_{L}^{l}\nusing frozen projection weights.\nThe Right Brain is\ntrainable\nand employs an\nAsymmetric Joint Attention\nmechanism. It queries not only its own context but also the semantic features from the Left Brain. Specifically, at each attention head, the Right Brain computes its Query (\nQ\nR\nQ_{R}\n), while the Key (\nK\nK\n) and Value (\nV\nV\n) are constructed by concatenating the representations from both brains:\nK\njoint\n\\displaystyle K_{\\text{joint}}\n=\n[\nsg\n​\n(\nK\nL\nl\n)\n;\nK\nR\nl\n]\n,\n\\displaystyle=[\\text{sg}(K_{L}^{l})\\ ;\\ K_{R}^{l}],\n(5)\nV\njoint\n\\displaystyle V_{\\text{joint}}\n=\n[\nsg\n​\n(\nV\nL\nl\n)\n;\nV\nR\nl\n]\n,\n\\displaystyle=[\\text{sg}(V_{L}^{l})\\ ;\\ V_{R}^{l}],\n(6)\n𝐇\nR\nl\n+\n1\n\\displaystyle\\mathbf{H}_{R}^{l+1}\n=\nSoftmax\n​\n(\nQ\nR\nl\n​\n(\nK\njoint\n)\nT\nd\nk\n)\n​\nV\njoint\n+\nFFN\n​\n(\n𝐇\nR\nl\n)\n,\n\\displaystyle=\\text{Softmax}\\left(\\frac{Q_{R}^{l}(K_{\\text{joint}})^{T}}{\\sqrt{d_{k}}}\\right)V_{\\text{joint}}+\\text{FFN}(\\mathbf{H}_{R}^{l}),\n(7)\nwhere\n[\n;\n]\n[\\ ;\\ ]\ndenotes concatenation along the sequence length dimension, and\nsg\n​\n(\n⋅\n)\n\\text{sg}(\\cdot)\nindicates the stop-gradient operation.\nThis asymmetric flow ensures a strict hierarchy: the Left Brain acts as a stable \"semantic anchor\" providing high-level reasoning features, while the Right Brain dynamically fuses these semantics with fine-grained proprioceptive cues to reason about spatial actions. The final hidden states of the Right Brain,\n𝐇\nR\nf\n​\ni\n​\nn\n​\na\n​\nl\n\\mathbf{H}_{R}^{final}\n, are then passed to the Action Expert.\n4.2\nFlow-Matching Action Expert\nTo enable high-precision, continuous control, we move beyond the discrete tokenization paradigm\n(Kim\net al.\n,\n2024\n)\nand adopt the state-of-the-art generative policy architecture utilized in recent foundation models like Isaac-GR00T\n(NVIDIA\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\nand\nπ\n0\n\\pi_{0}\n(Intelligence\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\n. Specifically, our Action Expert employs the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture\n(Peebles and Xie,\n2023\n)\nand is trained via flow matching.\nArchitecture and Conditioning.\nFollowing the design in Isaac-GR00T, the Action Expert operates as a conditional decoder that denoises action trajectories. It takes a noisy action sequence\n𝐚\nt\n\\mathbf{a}_{t}\nand the current timestep\nt\nt\nas input.\nWhile the policy architecture aligns with established baselines, a key distinction in our framework lies in the\nsource\nof the condition. We inject the spatially-rich representations from our trainable Right Brain,\n𝐇\nR\n\\mathbf{H}_{R}\n, into the DiT via cross-attention layers. This ensures that the proven control capabilities of the DiT are guided explicitly by the embodied perception features extracted by our asymmetric backbone.\nFlow-Matching Formulation.\nWe utilize the flow-matching objective to train the policy, as demonstrated effectively in prior work\n(NVIDIA\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\n. The process models a conditional probability path flowing from a standard Gaussian prior\n𝐚\n0\n∼\n𝒩\n​\n(\n𝟎\n,\n𝐈\n)\n\\mathbf{a}_{0}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0},\\mathbf{I})\nto the ground-truth action distribution\n𝐚\n1\n\\mathbf{a}_{1}\n.\nThe vector field regresson loss is defined as:\nℒ\nFM\n​\n(\nψ\n)\n=\n𝔼\nt\n,\n𝐚\n0\n,\n𝐚\n1\n​\n[\n‖\nv\nψ\n​\n(\n𝐚\nt\n,\nt\n,\n𝐇\nR\n)\n−\n(\n𝐚\n1\n−\n𝐚\n0\n)\n‖\n2\n]\n,\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{FM}}(\\psi)=\\mathbb{E}_{t,\\mathbf{a}_{0},\\mathbf{a}_{1}}\\left[||v_{\\psi}(\\mathbf{a}_{t},t,\\mathbf{H}_{R})-(\\mathbf{a}_{1}-\\mathbf{a}_{0})||^{2}\\right],\n(8)\nwhere\nv\nψ\nv_{\\psi}\nis the DiT network,\nt\n∼\n𝒰\n​\n[\n0\n,\n1\n]\nt\\sim\\mathcal{U}[0,1]\n, and the target vector field is the straight line\n𝐚\n1\n−\n𝐚\n0\n\\mathbf{a}_{1}-\\mathbf{a}_{0}\n.\nDuring inference, actions are synthesized by solving the Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) using an Euler solver, translating the Right Brain’s understanding into smooth robotic movements.\n4.3\nTraining Strategy\nOptimization Objective.\nConsistent with standard VLA fine-tuning paradigms\n(NVIDIA\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\n, we train\nTwinBrainVLA\nusing exclusively the robotic action objective. We do not incorporate auxiliary Next-Token Prediction (NTP) losses or mix in general vision-language datasets during this stage. The training objective is to minimize the Flow-Matching loss:\nℒ\ntotal\n=\nℒ\nFM\n​\n(\nθ\nR\n,\nψ\n,\nϕ\n;\n𝒟\nrobot\n)\n,\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{total}}=\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{FM}}(\\theta_{R},\\psi,\\phi;\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{robot}}),\n(9)\nwhere\n𝒟\nrobot\n\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{robot}}\nrepresents the robotic demonstration dataset, and\n{\nθ\nR\n,\nψ\n,\nϕ\n}\n\\{\\theta_{R},\\psi,\\phi\\}\ndenote the trainable parameters of the Right Brain, Action Expert, and State Encoder, respectively.\nIt is worth noting that in monolithic VLA architectures, relying solely on action loss typically leads to severe catastrophic forgetting of general semantic capabilities. However, our dual-stream design structurally immunizes the model against this degradation: the \"Right Brain\" is free to specialize entirely in control dynamics, while the frozen \"Left Brain\" implicitly safeguards the linguistic and semantic priors.\nAsymmetric Update Rule.\nWe enforce a strict parameter update policy. Let\nθ\nL\n\\theta_{L}\nbe the parameters of the Left Brain. During backpropagation, we set\n∇\nθ\nL\n=\n0\n\\nabla\\theta_{L}=0\n. Gradients originating from the Action Expert flow backwards through the DiT (\nψ\n\\psi\n), permeate the Right Brain (\nθ\nR\n\\theta_{R}\n) via the conditioning signals, and update the State Encoder (\nϕ\n\\phi\n). Crucially, at the AsyMoT fusion layer, the gradient flow is explicitly blocked (stop-gradient) at the Key-Value interface from the Left Brain. This ensures that the Left Brain acts as a stable semantic anchor, providing consistent features\nK\nL\n,\nV\nL\nK_{L},V_{L}\nwithout its weights being perturbed by the high-variance gradients typical of robotic control tasks.\n5\nExperiment\nTo comprehensively evaluate the efficacy of\nTwinBrainVLA\n, we conduct extensive experiments on two simulation benchmarks:\nSimplerEnv\n(Li\net al.\n,\n2024c\n)\nand\nRoboCasa\n(Nasiriany\net al.\n,\n2024\n)\n. Our training pipeline is built upon the starVLA framework\n(starVLA,\n2025\n)\n, distributed across 16\n×\n\\times\nNVIDIA H100 GPUs. We strictly follow its default training protocols to ensure a fair comparison. More extensive simulation benchmarks and real-world robotic experiments are in progress.\n5.1\nExperiments on SimplerEnv\nImplementation and Training Setup.\nTo demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our architecture, we instantiate\nTwinBrainVLA\nwith two state-of-the-art VLM backbones: Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct and Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct. Consistent with our asymmetric design, both the frozen Left Brain and the trainable Right Brain are initialized from these pre-trained checkpoints to ensure aligned feature spaces. For the training data, we utilize two large-scale subsets from the Open X-Embodiment (OXE) dataset: the\nBridge-V2\nand the\nFractal\ndataset. We are actively working on scaling our training to the complete OXE dataset, and future experimental results will be reported in subsequent updates. Comprehensive implementation details are provided in Appendix\nA\n.\nEvaluation.\nThe benchmark consists of four manipulation tasks: \"put spoon on towel\", \"put carrot on plate\", \"stack green block on yellow block\", \"put eggplant in the yellow basket\". For each task, we evaluate our VLA policy using the evaluation script provided by the SimplerEnv repository\n(Li\net al.\n,\n2024c\n)\n.

Specifically, we include Isaac-GR00T-N1.6\n(Team\net al.\n,\n2025b\n)\n, a large-scale VLA model that demonstrates strong performance on humanoid manipulation tasks. Additionally, to directly assess the advantages of our dual-brain architecture, we benchmark against two representative models from the starVLA framework\n(starVLA,\n2025\n)\n: QwenGR00T and QwenPI, both instantiated with Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct backbones. These baselines follow similar training protocols and utilize the same dataset, enabling a fair comparison and highlighting the specific contributions of our asymmetric dual-VLM design.\nResults.\nThe quantitative results on the RoboCasa GR1 Tabletop Benchmark are presented in Table\n2\n.\nTwinBrainVLA\nachieves the best performance across all 24 manipulation tasks, with our Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct variant attaining an average success rate of\n54.6%\n, followed closely by the Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct variant at 53.5%. These results substantially outperform all baseline methods: our best model surpasses Isaac-GR00T-N1.6 (47.6%) by +7.0%, QwenGR00T (47.8%) by +6.8%, and QwenPI (43.9%) by +10.7%. These results reinforce our hypothesis that decoupling semantic understanding from embodied perception enables more effective learning of fine-grained manipulation skills in complex tabletop scenarios.\n6\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we introduced\nTwinBrainVLA\n, a novel VLA framework that addresses the fundamental tension between semantic generalization and embodied specialization in robotic learning. By drawing inspiration from hemispheric lateralization, we proposed an asymmetric dual-stream architecture that structurally decouples the visual cognitive process. Our\nAsyMoT\nmechanism effectively synergizes a frozen \"Left Brain\" for robust open-world reasoning with a trainable \"Right Brain\" for precise sensorimotor control, enabling the system to master complex manipulation skills without \"catastrophic forgetting\" of its general visual capabilities.\nLimitation and Future Work\nWhile\nTwinBrainVLA\nprovides a powerful framework for decoupling semantic and embodied processing, several limitations remain that outline our future research directions.\nA more decoupled model architecture.\nFirst, the current implementation of the Asymmetric Mixture-of-Transformers (AsyMoT) mechanism requires the Left and Right Brains to share an identical model architecture. This structural constraint ensures compatible hidden state dimensions for seamless joint attention but limits the flexibility to pair heterogeneous models—for instance, synergizing a massive, reasoning-heavy VLM with a lightweight, high-frequency control model. We are actively exploring generalized fusion mechanisms, such as learnable projection layers or cross-attention adapters, to support backbones of varying sizes and architectures.\nMore diverse model checkpoints.\nSecond, both streams in our current setup are initialized from standard general-purpose VLM checkpoints (e.g., Qwen-VL). However, the field has arguably seen a surge in specialized Embodied VLMs trained specifically for robotics. Integrating these specialized models into our dual-brain paradigm—potentially initializing the \"Right Brain\" with an embodied checkpoint while retaining a generalist \"Left Brain\"—presents a promising avenue. We are currently investigating strategies to effectively adapt our framework to leverage these domain-specific post-trained weights.\nTraining on larger-scale data.\nThird, regarding data scale, our current training utilizes subsets of the Open X-Embodiment dataset. We acknowledge that the capacity of our dual-stream architecture may not be fully realized with limited data. We are in the process of scaling our pre-training to the complete dataset to further enhance the model’s robustness and downstream performance.\nMore benchmarks and real-robot experiment.\nFinally, future work will also focus on extending our evaluation to a broader range of benchmarks, including real-robot scenarios, to comprehensively assess the versatility of\nTwinBrainVLA\n.\nReferences\nS.

    "preview_text": "Standard Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models typically fine-tune a monolithic Vision-Language Model (VLM) backbone explicitly for robotic control. However, this approach creates a critical tension between maintaining high-level general semantic understanding and learning low-level, fine-grained sensorimotor skills, often leading to \"catastrophic forgetting\" of the model's open-world capabilities. To resolve this conflict, we introduce TwinBrainVLA, a novel architecture that coordinates a generalist VLM retaining universal semantic understanding and a specialist VLM dedicated to embodied proprioception for joint robotic control. TwinBrainVLA synergizes a frozen \"Left Brain\", which retains robust general visual reasoning, with a trainable \"Right Brain\", specialized for embodied perception, via a novel Asymmetric Mixture-of-Transformers (AsyMoT) mechanism. This design allows the Right Brain to dynamically query semantic knowledge from the frozen Left Brain and fuse it with proprioceptive states, providing rich conditioning for a Flow-Matching Action Expert to generate precise continuous controls. Extensive experiments on SimplerEnv and RoboCasa benchmarks demonstrate that TwinBrainVLA achieves superior manipulation performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines while explicitly preserving the comprehensive visual understanding capabilities of the pre-trained VLM, offering a promising direction for building general-purpose robots that simultaneously achieve high-level semantic understanding and low-level physical dexterity.\n\nTwinBrainVLA\n: Unleashing the Potential of Generalist VLMs for Embodied Tasks via Asymmetric Mixture-of-Transformers\nBin Yu\n1,2,\nShijie Lian\n2,4,\n1\n1\nfootnotemark:\n1\nXiaopeng Lin\n2,5,\n1\n1\nfootnotemark:\n1\nYuliang Wei\n1,\nZhaolong Shen\n2,6\nChangti Wu\n2,7\nYuzhuo Miao\n1,2\nXinming Wang\n2,8\nBailing Wang\n1\nCong Huang\n2,3\nKai Chen\n2,3,9,\n2\n2\nfootnotemark:\n2\n1\nHIT\n2\nZGCA\n3\nZGCI\n4\nHUST\n5\nHKUST(GZ)\n6\nBUAA\n7\nECNU\n8\nCASIA\n9\nDeepCybo\nEqual contributionCorrespo",

            "answer": "## 论文核心分析：TwinBrainVLA\n\n### **一、核心要解决的问题**\n论文旨在解决当前**视觉-语言-动作模型**在机器人控制任务中面临的一个根本性矛盾：\n- **矛盾点**：标准的VLA模型通常通过微调一个单一的、预训练的视觉-语言模型来学习机器人控制。这导致了**灾难性遗忘**——模型在适应低层次、精细的运动控制技能时，牺牲了其预训练获得的高层次、通用的语义理解和开放世界泛化能力。\n- **后果**：这违背了VLA范式的初衷（即利用VLM的通用世界知识来实现泛化的机器人控制），使得模型从一个“通才”退化为一个仅擅长动作的“专才”。\n\n### **二、核心创新点**\n论文提出了 **TwinBrainVLA** 架构，其创新性主要体现在以下三个层面：\n\n1. **架构创新：非对称双脑设计**\n    - **核心理念**：受大脑**半球功能侧化**启发，将通用语义理解与具身感知控制**解耦**。\n    - **“左脑”**：一个**冻结的、预训练的VLM**。负责保持强大的开放世界语义理解和指令跟随能力，作为稳定的“语义锚”。\n    - **“右脑”**：一个**可训练的、结构相同的VLM**。专门负责处理具身感知，接收视觉、文本**以及机器人本体感知状态**，学习与运动控制相关的空间和物理推理。\n\n2. **机制创新：非对称混合Transformer**\n    - **Asymmetric Mixture-of-Transformers**：这是连接双脑的核心技术。\n    - **工作方式**：在每一层，可训练的“右脑”会计算自身的查询向量，但同时将冻结“左脑”的键值对与自身的键值对**拼接**起来，共同参与注意力计算。\n    - **关键特性**：通过**停止梯度**操作，确保“左脑”的参数在训练中完全不被更新，其通用知识可以安全、动态地被“右脑”查询和利用，而不会因机器人控制任务的高方差梯度而受损。\n\n3. **训练策略创新：严格的非对称更新**\n    - 仅对“右脑”、状态编码器和动作专家进行优化。\n    - “左脑”始终保持冻结，其提供的语义特征作为稳定的条件输入，从结构上避免了灾难性遗忘。\n\n### **三、解决方案的完整流程**\n1. **输入处理**：\n    - **左脑**：接收图像和文本指令。\n    - **右脑**：额外接收通过轻量级MLP编码的机器人本体状态（如关节角度、末端执行器位姿）。\n\n2. **知识融合与表征生成**：\n    - 双脑通过 **AsyMoT 机制**进行交互。“右脑”在自身推理过程中，持续从“左脑”汲取通用语义知识，并将其与具体的本体感知信息融合。\n    - 最终，“右脑”输出的、富含空间和任务信息的表征，作为生成动作的**主要条件**。\n\n3. **动作生成**：\n    - 采用基于**流匹配**的扩散Transformer作为动作专家。\n    - 该专家以“右脑”的表征为条件，去噪并生成精确的连续机器人控制动作。\n\n4. **训练目标**：\n    - **仅使用机器人动作损失**进行训练，无需混合通用视觉-语言数据或辅助损失函数。\n    - 由于架构的解耦设计，即使只优化动作损失，“左脑”的通用能力也能得到完好保存。\n\n### **四、实际价值与验证**\n- **性能提升**：在 SimplerEnv 和 RoboCasa 两个主流仿真基准测试中，TwinBrainVLA 均取得了**最先进的操控性能**，超越了包括 Isaac-GR00T、π₀.₅ 在内的多个强大基线。\n- **能力保留**：**同时实现了高性能的机器人控制与完整的VLM语义能力**，真正兑现了“通才VLM用于具身任务”的潜力。\n- **方向性意义**：为构建**兼具高级认知和低级灵巧性**的通用机器人提供了一个有前景的新架构范式，即通过“分工协作”而非“单一模型全能”的方式来化解根本性矛盾。\n\n**总结**：TwinBrainVLA 的核心贡献在于，它通过一个**结构上解耦、机制上融合**的非对称双脑架构，系统性地解决了VLA模型中的“灾难性遗忘”难题，使得机器人既能“思考”又能“动手”，为迈向通用具身智能提供了关键的技术路径。",

            "answer": "## 论文《TwinBrainVLA》分析与发展脉络梳理\n\n### 一、核心技术创新与价值\n\n**TwinBrainVLA** 的核心贡献在于**解决了一个根本性矛盾**：传统视觉-语言-动作模型在微调用于机器人控制时，会因目标冲突导致**灾难性遗忘**——模型为了学习精细的运动控制技能，牺牲了其预训练获得的通用语义理解能力。\n\n**关键技术突破**：\n1.  **架构创新（不对称双脑设计）**：\n    - **左脑**：冻结的通用VLM，保留开放世界的语义理解和推理能力。\n    - **右脑**：可训练的专用VLM，专注于具身感知（融合视觉、语言和本体感觉状态）。\n    - **价值**：结构上解耦了“认知”与“控制”，使模型能同时保持高层次的语义能力和低层次的运动技能。\n\n2.  **机制创新（非对称混合Transformer - AsyMoT）**：\n    - 允许可训练的右脑通过**联合注意力**，动态查询并融合来自冻结左脑的语义知识（Key-Value对）。\n    - 采用**停止梯度**操作，确保左脑的参数和语义表征在训练中保持稳定，不被机器人控制任务的高方差梯度破坏。\n    - **价值**：实现了从通用知识到专用技能的安全、高效知识迁移，是解决灾难性遗忘的关键。\n\n3.  **训练策略创新**：\n    - **非对称更新规则**：仅更新右脑、状态编码器和动作专家，左脑完全冻结。\n    - **单一动作目标**：仅使用流匹配动作损失进行训练，无需混合通用VLM数据或辅助损失，简化了训练流程。\n    - **价值**：证明了通过巧妙的架构设计，可以仅用机器人数据训练，就能同时获得卓越的控制性能和保留的语义能力。\n\n**实际价值**：\n- **为通用机器人提供新范式**：为实现同时具备“大脑”（理解）和“小脑”（控制）的机器人指明了方向。\n- **提升数据效率与泛化能力**：通过利用冻结的通用VLM先验，可能减少对大规模机器人演示数据的依赖，并增强在开放场景中的泛化能力。\n- **工程友好**：基于现有强大VLM（如Qwen-VL）构建，利用了成熟生态。\n\n### 二、VLA模型发展脉络与演进方向\n\n该研究建立在近年来**视觉-语言-动作模型**的快速发展之上。其发展脉络可梳理为以下几个阶段和方向：\n\n#### **方向一：架构演进——从“单体微调”到“解耦设计”**\n- **早期工作（如OpenVLA）**：**直接微调**一个单一的、预训练的VLM主干网络，为其添加动作输出头。这导致了论文中指出的**灾难性遗忘**问题。\n- **改进工作**：开始尝试**部分解耦**。例如，一些工作仅微调VLM中的部分模块（如适配器），或引入额外的网络分支来处理空间信息，但主干网络仍可能被更新。\n- **TwinBrainVLA的贡献**：提出了**彻底的结构化解耦**。通过“双脑”非对称架构，从根本上隔离了语义理解和运动控制的学习过程。这是对“灾难性遗忘”问题的**根本性解决方案**，而非缓解措施。\n\n#### **方向二：训练策略演进——从“纯控制”到“多任务保留”**\n- **初期策略**：仅在机器人数据集上微调，目标是最小化动作预测误差。这直接导致语义能力退化。\n- **混合训练策略**：后续工作（如 `Actions as Language`）尝试在训练中混合通用视觉-语言对话数据和机器人数据，使用**多任务损失**（如下一个词预测损失 + 动作损失），旨在保留VLM的对话能力。\n- **TwinBrainVLA的策略**：**回归单一目标，但通过架构保证保留**。它仅使用动作损失，但依靠冻结的左脑来**结构性地、隐式地**保留所有语义能力。这简化了训练目标，避免了多任务学习的权衡和复杂性。\n\n#### **方向三：空间与具身感知增强——从“语义VLM”到“具身VLM”**\n- **问题意识**：通用VLM在**空间推理**（如相对位置、距离、几何）方面存在固有弱点，而这对于机器人控制至关重要。\n- **专用模型涌现**：出现了专门为具身场景设计的**具身基础模型**。这些模型通过在后训练阶段注入空间感知数据或设计空间感知模块，增强VLM的空间理解能力。\n- **TwinBrainVLA的定位**：它没有选择创建一个全新的“具身VLM”，而是**通过架构整合来弥补**。其“右脑”通过接收**本体感觉状态**作为输入，并专注于从视觉观察中提取与运动控制相关的特征，从而具备了“具身感知” specialization。同时，它通过AsyMoT从“左脑”获取通用语义作为补充。\n\n#### **方向四：动作表示与生成演进——从“离散化”到“连续流匹配”**\n- **早期动作表示**：将连续动作离散化为令牌，使用VLM的语言模型头进行自回归预测。\n- **先进动作生成**：采用**扩散Transformer**和**流匹配**等生成式模型来直接建模连续动作分布。这已成为当前SOTA VLA模型（如Isaac-GR00T, π₀）的标准配置。\n- **TwinBrainVLA的采用**：论文采用了基于DiT的流匹配动作专家，这表明它聚焦于**架构创新**，而在动作生成层面则集成了当前领域公认的最佳实践。其创新点在于**动作专家的条件输入源**——来自其专有的、经过具身感知训练的“右脑”表征。\n\n### 三、总结：TwinBrainVLA在脉络中的位置\n\n`TwinBrainVLA` 代表了VLA模型发展的一个**融合与突破点**：\n1.  **它吸收了架构解耦的思想**，并将其推向极致，形成了清晰的不对称双脑范式。\n2.  **它摒弃了复杂的多任务混合训练**，用简洁的架构设计实现了更根本的能力保留。\n3.  **它没有从头构建具身VLM**，而是通过双脑分工与融合，让通用VLM和专用控制网络各司其职、协同工作。\n4.  **它集成了先进的连续动作生成技术**，确保在控制性能上不落后。\n\n**未来发展方向（基于论文展望）**：\n- **更灵活的架构配对**：支持不同架构、不同大小的“左脑”和“右脑”组合。\n- **融入领域专用模型**：用后训练的“具身VLM”初始化“右脑”，进一步提升起点。\n- **更大规模数据训练**：在完整OXE等数据集上验证架构的扩展性。\n- **现实世界验证**：将仿真中的成功迁移到真实机器人复杂环境中。\n\n总之，`TwinBrainVLA` 通过一个优雅的神经架构设计，系统性地解决了VLA领域的核心矛盾，为构建真正“知行合一”的通用机器人智能体提供了强有力的新框架。",

            "question": "论文的主要局限性有哪些？未来可能的改进方向是什么？",
            "answer": "## 论文主要局限性分析\n\n根据论文第6节“Limitation and Future Work”，**TwinBrainVLA** 主要存在以下四个方面的局限性：\n\n- **模型架构耦合性较强**：当前的**非对称混合Transformer（AsyMoT）** 机制要求“左脑”（通用VLM）和“右脑”（专用VLM）必须具有**完全相同的模型架构**。这确保了隐藏状态维度兼容，便于进行联合注意力计算，但也限制了架构设计的灵活性。例如，无法轻松地将一个庞大的、侧重推理的VLM与一个轻量级的、侧重高频控制的模型进行组合。\n\n- **模型检查点来源单一**：目前，双脑的初始化均依赖于标准的**通用VLM检查点**（如Qwen-VL系列）。然而，领域内已经出现了大量专门为机器人任务训练的**具身VLM**。论文指出，尚未探索将这类经过领域特定后训练的模型集成到双脑范式中的潜力，例如用具身VLM初始化“右脑”，同时保留通用VLM作为“左脑”。\n\n- **训练数据规模有限**：当前的实验仅在**Open X-Embodiment数据集的两个子集**（Bridge-V2和Fractal）上进行训练。作者承认，双流架构的潜力可能尚未在更大规模的数据上得到充分释放。\n\n- **评估范围有待扩展**：目前的评估主要集中在**仿真环境**（SimplerEnv和RoboCasa）中。论文尚未包含**真实机器人场景**的测试，这限制了对其在现实世界复杂性和不确定性下泛化能力的全面评估。\n\n## 未来可能的改进方向\n\n针对上述局限性，论文提出了明确的未来研究方向：\n\n- **开发更解耦的模型架构**：探索更通用的融合机制，例如**可学习的投影层**或**交叉注意力适配器**。这将支持不同大小、不同架构的骨干模型进行组合，实现更灵活的“异构双脑”协同（如“巨型推理脑”+“轻量控制脑”）。\n\n- **集成更多样化的模型检查点**：研究如何有效地将**领域专用的具身VLM**整合到双脑范式中。一个关键方向是探索用经过机器人数据后训练的VLM来初始化“右脑”，同时保持“左脑”的通用性，以期获得更强的即插即用的控制能力。\n\n- **在更大规模数据上进行训练**：计划将预训练扩展到**完整的Open X-Embodiment数据集**，以充分挖掘模型潜力，进一步提升其鲁棒性和下游任务性能。\n\n- **扩展评测基准与进行真机实验**：未来的工作将致力于在**更广泛的评测基准**上进行测试，并最终开展**真实机器人实验**，以全面验证 **TwinBrainVLA** 在物理世界中的通用性和实用性。\n\n**总结**：**TwinBrainVLA** 的核心创新在于通过架构设计解决了“灾难性遗忘”问题，但其当前实现仍受限于架构的对称性、模型来源的单一性以及数据和评估的规模。未来的改进将围绕**架构解耦**、**模型异构化**、**数据规模化**和**评测现实化**四个维度展开，旨在构建更灵活、更强大、更实用的通用机器人智能体。",
