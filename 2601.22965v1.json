By modeling entire trajectories through iterative denoising, these policies ensure spatiotemporal consistency compared to sequential action prediction\n[\n10\n]\n. The generative nature of diffusion allows the policy to capture multi-modal trajectory distributions, making it well suited to complex environments with multiple feasible routes to a goal.\nA common strategy to train diffusion policies is imitation learning (IL) using expert demonstrations. However, IL introduces two critical bottlenecks.\nFirst, robustness is compromised by the limited coverage of expert datasets, causing policies to struggle under distributional shifts and fail in novel scenarios\n[\n23\n,\n28\n]\n.\nSecond, inference efficiency is affected.\nStandard IL attempts to imitate all given trajectories, including a diverse set of suboptimal ones, which leads to increased sampling variance and heterogeneous trajectory quality.\nConsequently, inference typically relies on a “generate-then-filter” pipeline with auxiliary trajectory selectors\n[\n4\n,\n39\n,\n3\n,\n15\n]\nto select among numerous sampled candidates, which leads to increased latency, especially on resource-constrained devices.\nThese challenges for classic imitation-based diffusion policy are illustrated in\nFig.\n1\n(a).\nFigure 1\n:\nComparison between imitation and self-imitation based diffusion policy.\n(a) The classic imitation-based diffusion policy tends to generate trajectories with high variability, including unsafe, non-shortest or goal-unreachable routes, therefore relies on extensive sampling with post-filtering to obtain a final plan.\n(b) SIDP achieves distribution concentration via reward-guided self-imitation, enabling robust and efficient path planning without auxiliary selectors.\n(c) Validation across two robot platforms in real-world environments.\nIn this work, we propose the\nSelf-Imitated Diffusion Policy\n(SIDP), a framework designed for efficient and robust path planning in visual navigation.\nSIDP employs a reward-guided self-imitation scheme\n[\n20\n]\n, in which target trajectories are self-generated by the policy rather than sourced from external demonstrations.\nBy reweighting these trajectories based on their rewards, the framework prioritizes learning from high-quality experiences.\nThis training design facilitates iterative policy refinement by leveraging diverse navigation data and environmental feedback, thereby empowering the policy to develop\nrobust\nbehaviors that generalize beyond the inherent biases of fixed expert datasets.\nBeyond improving generalization, SIDP circumvents the complexity of RL-tuned diffusion\n[\n32\n,\n24\n]\nby eliminating the need for backpropagation through the entire sequence of denoising steps, a practice known as Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) that is often computationally prohibitive and numerically unstable\n[\n36\n]\n.\nBy reformulating this challenging optimization into an iterative imitation learning objective, SIDP achieves stable policy gradients efficiently.\nFurthermore, this self-imitation paradigm fundamentally enhances navigation\nefficiency\nby fostering distributional concentration.\nOur policy preserves inter-modal diversity and promoting intra-modal convergence since suboptimal and redundant trajectories are progressively pruned during self-imitation learning.\nThis inherent refinement obviates the need for dense sampling and post-filtering, thus eliminating the reliance on an external selector and resulting in a more streamlined, end-to-end inference process.\nBesides, deterministic sampling with fewer denoising steps\n[\n29\n]\nis thus made feasible, which can further speed up the inference.\nUnder the SIDP framework, we devise two complementary learning strategies to augment the training process.\nFirst, we incorporate goal-agnostic exploration to enable autonomous navigation capabilities and diversify the trajectory pool, which also provides a critical regularization effect for point-goal navigation.\nSecond, a reward-driven curriculum learning scheme is employed to prioritize scenarios with high learning potential, effectively addressing the issue of inefficient data utility by dynamically selecting the most constructive training samples throughout the training process.\nThrough extensive experiments, SIDP achieves state-of-the-art performance on the InternVLA-N1 S1 Benchmark\n[\n4\n]\n, outperforming existing methods in both Success Rate (SR) and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL).\nWhile the recent baseline method exhibits a significant performance degradation when transitioning from synthetic training scenes to complex, high-fidelity test environments, SIDP effectively mitigates this distribution shift.\nSpecifically, SIDP surpasses NavDP by approximately 10 points on the InternScene-Commercial setting, underscoring its superior generalization capabilities and robustness in unseen, unstructured environments.\nFurthermore, SIDP boosts the inference efficiency of the baseline to 2.5\n×\n\\times\non the Jetson Orin Nano without compromising navigation performance, reducing the latency from 273 ms to 110 ms.\nSuccessful deployment across two distinct robotic platforms confirms that SIDP provides a practical solution for real-world visual navigation.\nThe key contributions are summarized as follows:\n•\nWe propose a Self-Imitated Diffusion Policy that enhances robustness through high-quality self-generated experiences. By fostering distributional concentration, SIDP eliminates the need for dense sampling and post-filtering, streamlining the planning process.\n•\nWe introduce goal-agnostic exploration and reward-driven curriculum learning, which effectively diversifies trajectory pool and mitigates inefficient data utility\n, thus regularizing point-goal navigation and promoting convergence.\n•\nSIDP achieves state-of-the-art performance on high-fidelity benchmarks in SR and SPL. Besides, it achieves a 2.5\n×\n\\times\ninference speedup on the edge devices, Jetson Orin Nano, demonstrating its practicality for real-world robotics.\nII\nRELATED WORK\nII-A\nPath Planning in Visual Navigation\nPath planning in visual navigation can be categorized into mapping-based and learning-based approaches.\nMapping-based methods\n[\n19\n,\n5\n]\nrely on visual Simultaneous Localization And Mapping(vSLAM) for map construction and pose estimation, followed by graph-search or sampling-based planners such as Dijkstra, A*, or RRT* to compute feasible paths.\nWhile effective in structured static environments, these methods are constrained by the need for precise mapping and heuristic planning algorithms, reducing robustness in dynamic or perceptually degraded scenarios.\nIn contrast, learning-based approaches avoid explicit mapping by either training policies in simulation or directly imitating expert demonstrations.\nPrevious reinforcement learning (RL) methods\n[\n33\n,\n37\n,\n7\n]\nexploit reward signals derived from environmental priors to train navigation policies, but incur high computational cost and transfer poorly to real-world domains.\nImitation learning (IL) offers better data efficiency\n[\n2\n,\n8\n,\n27\n,\n13\n,\n14\n,\n34\n]\n.\nHowever, IL-based planners are constrained by the scarcity and fidelity of expert demonstrations, frequently suffering from distribution shift.\nMoreover, they lack robust mechanisms to suppress compounding errors, which leads to drift during long-horizon navigation.\nInteractive IL frameworks\n[\n26\n,\n11\n]\nmitigate such issues by iteratively refining expert datasets.\nII-B\nPlanning Methods Based on Diffusion Policy\nDiffusion models have recently gained attention in sequential decision-making for their ability to capture multimodal distributions via iterative denoising compared to other autoregressive\n[\n2\n,\n8\n,\n27\n,\n13\n]\nand latent-variable models\n[\n14\n,\n34\n]\n.\nDiffuser\n[\n10\n]\nreformulates reinforcement learning as conditional trajectory generation, while Decision Diffuser\n[\n1\n]\nextends this by conditioning on returns and constraints.\nLater works further explore extensions to long-horizon tasks through hierarchical or compositional formulations\n[\n16\n,\n18\n]\n.\nThese advances have motivated the application of diffusion policies to path planning.\nNoMaD\n[\n30\n]\ndirectly generate trajectories from observations and integrate goal masking for goal-conditioned and undirected exploration. NavDP\n[\n4\n]\nleverages privileged information in simulation for path planning in indoor scenes.\nSome works integrate diffusion into classical planning pipelines to improve collision avoidance and planning efficiency\n[\n6\n,\n38\n]\n, or employ guided sampling strategies to enforce safety and encourage exploration\n[\n39\n,\n25\n,\n17\n,\n35\n,\n40\n,\n12\n]\n.\nThese approaches demonstrate that diffusion can flexibly model diverse candidate trajectories while incorporating task-specific constraints or guidance.\nHowever, they often require an auxiliary rule-based or learned selector\n[\n4\n,\n15\n,\n3\n]\nto assess and filter trajectories generated through diffusion sampling, in order to ensure feasibility and safety.\nSuch dependencies increase architectural complexity, posing bottlenecks to both computational efficiency and performance during real-world deployment.\nThese limitations underscore the need for paradigms that intrinsically streamline trajectory generation, enabling robust, end-to-end planning with both theoretical elegance and practical efficiency.\nFigure 2\n:\nOverview of the Self-Imitated Diffusion Policy (SIDP). The framework generates candidate trajectories using the current policy\nπ\nθ\n\\pi_{\\theta}\nand filters them via a reward-based sorting gate.

the importance weight of the\ni\ni\n-th candidate.\nIII-B\n2\nImportance Weights\nAccording to REPS\n[\n22\n]\n, the optimal distribution that maximizes the expected reward, subject to a KL-divergence trust-region constraint relative to the current policy, is analytically given by:\np\n∗\n​\n(\na\n|\ns\nt\n)\n∝\nπ\nθ\n​\n(\na\n|\ns\nt\n)\n​\nexp\n⁡\n(\nr\n​\n(\ns\nt\n,\na\n)\nτ\n)\n,\np^{*}(a|s_{t})\\propto\\pi_{\\theta}(a|s_{t})\\exp\\left(\\frac{r(s_{t},a)}{\\tau}\\right),\n(6)\nwhere\nτ\n\\tau\nis the temperature parameter that controls the constraint strength,\nπ\nθ\n\\pi_{\\theta}\ndenotes the reference (current) policy.\nGenerally, the importance weights\n[\n21\n]\nassigned to the candidates are the likelihood ratio\nw\n=\np\n∗\n/\nπ\nθ\nw=p^{*}/\\pi_{\\theta}\n.\nCombining with\nEq.\n6\n, we have\nw\nw\nrelying solely on the trajectory quality\nr\n​\n(\ns\nt\n,\na\n)\nr(s_{t},a)\n.\nOur reward setting are detailed in\nTab.\nI\n.\nTo mitigate the high variance caused by the exponential nature of Boltzmann distributions, we apply a top-\nk\nk\ntruncation strategy that retains only the\nk\nk\nhighest-reward candidates to cover the dominant modes of\np\n∗\np^{*}\n, as shown in\nFig.\n2\nphase-2.\nThe rewards are normalized to have importance

Diffusion Policy Loss\nInspired by the derivation in DDPM\n[\n9\n]\n, maximizing the weighted log-likelihood is reduced to minimizing the reward-weighted denoising loss, which is exactly our SIDP objective:\nℒ\nSIDP\n=\n∑\ni\n=\n1\nk\nw\n​\n(\na\nt\n(\ni\n)\n)\n​\n𝔼\nt\nd\n​\nn\n,\nϵ\n​\n[\n‖\nϵ\n−\nϵ\nθ\n​\n(\na\nt\n(\ni\n)\n,\nt\nd\n​\nn\n,\nt\nd\n​\nn\n,\ns\nt\n)\n‖\n2\n2\n]\n\\boxed{\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{SIDP}}=\\sum_{i=1}^{k}w(a_{t}^{(i)})\\,\\mathbb{E}_{t_{dn},\\epsilon}\\Big[\\bigl\\|\\epsilon-\\epsilon_{\\theta}(a_{t}^{(i),t_{dn}},t_{dn},s_{t})\\bigr\\|_{2}^{2}\\Big]}\n(8)\nwhere\nt\nd\n​\nn\nt_{dn}\nis

Refer to\nAlgorithm\n1\nfor a summary view.\nBy integrating reward-guided self-imitation with the representational power of diffusion models, SIDP forms a coherent pipeline for iterative policy

reward-driven curriculum learning.\nIII-C\n1\nGoal-agnostic Exploration\nWe augment the training process with an extra\ngoal-agnostic\nsetting, to activate the exploration ability\n[\n30\n]\nand regularize the point-goal navigation learning.\nAt each environment reset, we first sample auxiliary goal points following a uniform angular and distance distribution within the range of\n−\n60\n∼\n60\n∘\n-60\\sim 60^{\\circ}\nand 3\n∼\n\\sim\n5 m.\nThen feasible secure paths towards these goals are generated by the current policy\nπ\nθ\n\\pi_{\\theta}\n.\nDuring the training forward pass, the point goal\ng\nt\ng_{t}\nin the input state\nEq.\n1\nis replaced with a special goal-agnostic embedding, while the importance weights in\nEq.\n5\nare set to be uniform.\nThis strategy facilitates goal-agnostic exploration by decoupling policy behaviors from specific objectives.\nMeanwhile, the sampled trajectories exhibit increased diversity, preventing the policy from overfitting to a narrow trajectory distribution.\nIII-C\n2\nReward-Driven Curriculum Learning\nIn the process of self-imitation generation, certain scenarios may be overly complex for the current policy.\nTrajectories generated in these scenarios are often suboptimal and can inject training noise that impairs stable policy convergence.\nFurthermore, it is crucial to prevent the model from overfitting to a narrow distribution of scenarios, which frequently leads to sub-optimal local minima.\nTo address these issues, we design a dynamic curriculum that prioritizes scenarios with high learning potential.\nFor each scenario\ns\ni\ns_{i}\n, we assess its current learning potential using two metrics derived from sampled trajectories: the maximum trajectory reward\nR\nmax\n​\n(\ns\ni\n)\nR_{\\text{max}}(s_{i})\nand the reward range\nR\nrange\n​\n(\ns\ni\n)\nR_{\\text{range}}(s_{i})\n.\nA scenario is selected for training if it satisfies\nR\nmax\n​\n(\ns\ni\n)\n≥\nτ\nmax\nR_{\\text{max}}(s_{i})\\geq\\tau_{\\text{max}}\nand\nR\nrange\n​\n(\ns\ni\n)\n≥\nτ\nrange\nR_{\\text{range}}(s_{i})\\geq\\tau_{\\text{range}}\n,\nwhere\nτ\nmax\n\\tau_{\\text{max}}\nguarantees learning feasibility, while\nτ\nrange\n\\tau_{\\text{range}}\npromotes informative gradient variance to facilitate policy discrimination.\nIII-D\nEfficient Inference of SIDP\nAscribed to our learning framework, SIDP generates concentrated and robust trajectory distributions.\nConsequently, it bypasses the conventional “generate-then-filter” paradigm that introduces non-negligible computational overhead during inference.\nInstead of relying on an auxiliary selector to filter multiple candidates, SIDP directly yields a viable trajectory through the denoising process, significantly streamlining the inference pipeline.\nAnother advantage is that SIDP enables the use of DDIM\n[\n29\n]\nfor deterministic sampling.\nCompared to the stochastic DDPM\n[\n9\n]\n, DDIM reduces actual inference steps significantly, thus further improving planning efficiency.\nTo be clear, previous planners\n[\n4\n,\n30\n]\nrely on sample stochasticity via DDPM to explore a broader range of

the\nInternVLA-N1 S1\nbenchmark\n[\n4\n]\nleveraging the high-fidelity Isaac Sim simulator.\nThis benchmark focuses on closed-loop sequential navigation (real-time), requiring the agent to reach goals through continuous, multi-step navigation.\nThe benchmark comprises 60 diverse scenes, including 40 from\nInternScenes\n(equally divided into home and commercial) and 20 from\nClutteredEnv\n(including 10 easy and 10 hard).\nFor each scene, 100 start-goal pairs were randomly sampled in unoccupied spaces. Initial orientations were pre-calculated via path planning to ensure collision-free initialization.\nFor the ablation studies, we curated a compact yet representative benchmark derived from the\nInternData-N1\ndataset\n[\n4\n]\n, encompassing 5 scenes and 500 total trials.\nIn contrast to the real-time interaction of the\nInternVLA-N1 S1\nbenchmark, this setup focuses on one-shot trajectory generation (single-step), evaluating the policy’s ability to plan an entire path in a single inference.\nTo ensure evaluation consistency, we utilized fixed starting positions paired with randomly sampled goals for each scene.\nIV-A\n2\nEvaluation Metrics\nTo facilitate a comprehensive and rigorous evaluation, we report the following standard metrics for the main navigation task:\n•\nSuccess Rate (SR, %):\nThe percentage of episodes where the agent successfully reaches within 0.5 m of the target.\n•\nSuccess weighted by Path Length (SPL, %):\nA metric evaluating both success and path efficiency, defined as:\nSPL\n=\n1\nN\n​\n∑\ni\n=\n1\nN\nS\ni\n⋅\nL\ni\nmax\n⁡\n(\nP\ni\n,\nL\ni\n)\n,\n\\text{SPL}=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}S_{i}\\cdot\\frac{L_{i}}{\\max(P_{i},L_{i})},\n(9)\nwhere\nS\ni\nS_{i}\nis the binary success indicator,\nL\ni\nL_{i}\nis the geodesic shortest path length, and\nP\ni\nP_{i}\nis the actual path length taken by the agent.\nFurthermore, to analyze safety and exploration quality in the ablation studies on our custom benchmark, we introduce three additional metrics:\n•\nCollision Rate (CR, %):\nThe proportion of episodes in which the agent encounters at least one collision, serving as a key indicator of navigation safety.\n•\nDistance To Goal (DTG, m):\nThe average Euclidean distance between the agent’s final position and the goal.\n•\nExploration Area (EA, m\n2\n):\nThe non-redundant union of\n16\n16\nsampled trajectories (each modeled as a\n0.2\n​\nm\n0.2\\text{m}\n-wide swept area), quantifying goal-agnostic exploration diversity.\nIV-B\nImplementation Details\nIV-B\n1\nTraining Scenario Construction\nTo facilitate efficient self-imitation learning without the computational overhead of full physics simulation, we construct an interactive environment based on the\nInternData-N1\ndataset\n[\n4\n]\n.\nSpecifically, we sample the agent’s initial poses from the expert trajectories provided in the dataset, employing temporal subsampling to enhance state diversity.\nSubsequently, point goals of varying difficulty are generated using the scene’s global Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF), which also ensures collision-free initialization.\nFurthermore, collision detection is approximated by directly querying ESDF values along predicted paths, enabling the agent to rapidly evaluate trajectory safety against complex scene geometries during the iterative training process. The detailed reward formulation is presented in\nTab.\nI\n.\nIV-B\n2\nNetwork Architecture and Training Details\nWe utilize the diffusion-based network, NavDP\n[\n4\n]\n, as the initialization for our policy network, while omitting the auxiliary critic network typically required for trajectory selection.\nThe model is optimized using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of\n2\n×\n10\n−\n5\n2\\times 10^{-5}\n. We employ an effective batch size of 128 (\n64\n×\n2\n64\\times 2\n), distributed across two NVIDIA A100 GPUs.\nThe entire training process spans approximately 35 hours.\nIV-C\nComparisons with State-of-the-art Methods\nWe compare our method with several learning-based visual navigation approaches on key metrics of success and efficiency.\nViPlanner and iPlanner are planning-based baselines that rely on learned perception modules coupled with analytical planners.\nNavDP shares a similar diffusion-based architecture to ours but is trained purely via imitation learning without self-imitation, serving as our primary baseline for assessing both robustness and efficiency.\nIV-C\n1\nNavigation Performance Analysis.\nQuantitative results are summarized in Table\nII\n. Our proposed SIDP achieves the highest SR across all evaluated scenarios and demonstrates superior overall performance in SPL, as evidenced by the highest mean metrics (mSR and mSPL)\nNotably, the performance advantage of SIDP is most pronounced in the challenging\nInternScenes\nenvironments.\nIn the\nCommercial\nand\nHome\nscenarios, which feature intricate furniture layouts and narrow traversable regions, SIDP outperforms NavDP by substantial margins of 9.94% and 5.79% in Success Rate, respectively.\nThis demonstrates that the self-imitation mechanism effectively refines the diffusion policy, enabling it to handle complex geometric constraints where imitation learning often struggles.\nIn the randomized\nClutteredEnv\nenvironments, the performance gap between SIDP and NavDP narrows.\nWe attribute this to a performance saturation effect: the baseline NavDP is already highly competent in these simpler obstacle avoidance tasks (achieving\n>\n93\n%\n>93\\%\nSR in Easy settings).\nHowever, even in these scenarios, SIDP maintains a consistent edge, validating its generalizability and robustness.\nIV-C\n2\nComputational Efficiency.\nBeyond success rates, we evaluate the efficiency of our approach for real-world deployment. We measure the path inference latency against NavDP on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Super development kit (8GB RAM), a representative hardware configuration for modern mobile robots.\nAs shown in Table\nIII\n, over 100 trials on this device, SIDP with 10-step DDPM sampling achieved an average inference time of 132 ms, nearly 2\n×\n\\times\nfaster than NavDP(273 ms).\nUtilizing DDIM sampling further optimizes the inference pipeline. Notably, when reducing the denoising steps to 5, the inference time decreases to 110ms while the SR even marginally improves to 0.674. Even with a highly compressed 3-step configuration, SIDP maintains a competitive SR of 0.655 with a latency of only 99ms. These results identify the 5-step DDIM configuration as the optimal balance, providing the highest success rate with significant computational efficiency.\nTABLE III\n:\nInference time comparison between different models and scheduler.\nMethod\nScheduler\nDenoising Steps\nTime (ms)\nSR(\n↑\n\\uparrow\n)\nNavDP\nDDPM\n10\n273 (1\n×\n\\times\n)\n0.549\nSIDP\nDDPM\n10\n132 (2.07\n×\n\\times\n)\n0.670\nSIDP\nDDIM\n10\n131 (2.08\n×\n\\times\n)\n0.670\nSIDP\nDDIM\n5\n110 (2.48\n×\n\\times\n)\n0.674\nSIDP\nDDIM\n3\n99\n(2.76\n×\n\\times\n)\n0.655\nThis efficiency gain stems from our self-imitation framework, which generates a concentrated and reliable trajectory distribution, eliminating the need for stochastic and computationally expensive trajectory sampling and filtering seen in traditional diffusion planners.\nIV-D\nAblation Studies and Analysis\nTo evaluate the contribution of each key component in our framework, we conduct a series of ablation experiments corresponding to the strategies introduced in Section\nIII\n:\n(1) the impact of the proposed\nReward-Guided Self-Imitation\nmechanism (Section\nIII-B\n) on training stability and convergence;\n(2) the influence of the\nGoal-agnostic Exploration\nstrategy (Section\nIII-C\n) designed to diversify the training data; and\n(3) the effectiveness of the\nReward-Driven Curriculum Learning\nscheme(Section\nIII-C\n) in prioritizing high-reward training scenarios.\nIV-D\n1\nReward-Guided Self-Imitation\nFigure 3\n:\nLearning curves of SIDP under different temperature coefficients during training. The curves are smoothed using a Gaussian filter (\nσ\n=\n10\n\\sigma=10\n), and the shaded region indicates the rolling-window standard deviation, capturing performance fluctuations caused by environment variations and randomly sampled navigation goals.\nTo validate the advantage of our exponential weighting strategy, we compare it with another linear weighting baseline, denoted as\nLin. Weig\n, where importance weights are assigned linearly based on the reward for all positive trajectories, instead of using the Softmax transformation.\nAs illustrated in\nFigs.\n3\nand\n4\n, Lin. Weig lags far behind the exponential function with\nτ\n=\n1.0\n\\tau=1.0\nin overall performance, which may be caused by its lack of sufficient selection pressure to distinguish trajectories.\nWe also investigate the temperature coefficient\nτ\n\\tau\n, which modulates this selection sharpness.\nIn\nFigs.\n3\nand\n4\n,\nτ\n=\n1.0\n\\tau=1.0\nyields optimal performance.\nExtreme values prove detrimental: low\nτ\n\\tau\nleads to instability by over-fitting to a few samples, while high\nτ\n\\tau\nflattens the action importance distribution.\nFigure 4\n:\nAblation study of the reward-guided self-imitation mechanism and the Softmax temperature coefficient\nτ\n\\tau\n.\nIV-D\n2\nGoal-agnostic Exploration\nTo evaluate the impact of goal-agnostic trajectory augmentation on the point-goal navigation and goal-agnostic exploration, we compare models trained with and without\ngoal-agnostic\nsetting. Note that in the goal-agnostic exploration, no explicit target is provided thus only the CR and EA metrics are reported.\nAs shown in Fig\n5\n, in the point-goal navigation tasks, incorporating the goal-agnostic trajectory augmentation during training leads to trajectories that are both safer and closer to the target, suggesting that goal-agnostic trajectory augmentation acts as a form of regularization that improves the overall navigation performance.\nIn the goal-agnostic exploration tasks, the model trained with goal-agnostic settings achieves a lower CR and a higher EA, indicating its ability to generate safe and diverse trajectories for exploration.\nNotably, this suggests that the goal-agnostic setting enables the model to produce consistently high-quality trajectories while preserving the inherent multi-modal distribution characteristic of diffusion policies.\nFigure 5\n:\nAblation study of goal-agnostic training under different evaluation settings.\nIV-D\n3\nReward-Driven Curriculum Learning\nWe investigate the effect of the reward-driven curriculum learning.\nAs shown in\nFig.\n6\n, the policy trained with curriculum learning achieves higher SR, SPL and lower CR, DTG.\nThe improved SR and reduced CR suggest that the policy benefits from prioritizing feasible scenarios as governed by\nR\nmax\nR_{\\text{max}}\n, thereby mitigating the destabilizing influence of failed trajectories. Simultaneously, the gains in SPL and DTG align with our objective of leveraging\nR\nrange\nR_{\\text{range}}\nto provide discriminative signals, which encourages the model to optimize for navigational efficiency rather than mere task completion.\nFigure 6\n:\nAblation study of reward-driven curriculum learning on policy performance.\nFigure 7\n:\nQualitative results of visual end-to-end navigation.\nTop: Diverse robot platforms (wheeled and quadruped) and their respective POV trajectories. Bottom: Third-person perspective of a navigation trial, showing the static environment (left) and the generated collision-free trajectory (right) visualized via motion blur.\nIV-E\nReal-world Deployment\nFig.\n7\ndemonstrates the robust real-world performance of our method on Unitree Go2 and Agilex T-rex platforms.\nWe utilize a stereo camera setup to acquire synchronized left and right RGB images, which are subsequently processed by BANet\n[\n31\n]\nto estimate the corresponding high-density depth maps.\nOur SIDP framework processes RGB-D inputs alongside human-specified goal points, enabling empirical validation across diverse environments such as offices and hallways.\nThe time-lapse trajectory (bottom right) demonstrates a continuous, collision-free path, highlighting the sim-to-real adaptability and stable navigation of our framework in complex scenes.\nV\nConclusion\nWe introduced the Self-Imitated Diffusion Policy (SIDP) framework, which combines self-imitation learning with diffusion models to enable efficient and robust path planning for visual navigation. By continuously learning from self-generated experiences, SIDP overcomes the suboptimal and incomplete nature of expert datasets, training policies that generate higher-performing trajectories, which also reduces the need for complex trajectory selection, lowering computational overhead and improving efficiency. The framework also incorporates two key strategies: goal-agnostic exploration to enhance regularization, and reward-driven curriculum learning to enhance data utility, further optimizing the policy’s performance.\nExperimental results demonstrate that SIDP outperforms existing methods across various metrics, including success rates(SR), success weighted by path Length(SPL). Additionally, SIDP achieves a 2.5\n×\n\\times\nspeedup in inference latency on embedded platforms, proving its suitability for real-time robotic deployment.\nIn conclusion, SIDP provides a robust and efficient solution for visual navigation, bridging the gap between generative models and practical robotic applications.\nAcknowledgment\nThis research was supported by the Key Scientific Research Program of Hangzhou Municipal Bureau of Science and Technology grants 2025SZD1A01.\nReferences\n[1]\nA.

    "preview_text": "Diffusion policies (DP) have demonstrated significant potential in visual navigation by capturing diverse multi-modal trajectory distributions. However, standard imitation learning (IL), which most DP methods rely on for training, often inherits sub-optimality and redundancy from expert demonstrations, thereby necessitating a computationally intensive \"generate-then-filter\" pipeline that relies on auxiliary selectors during inference. To address these challenges, we propose Self-Imitated Diffusion Policy (SIDP), a novel framework that learns improved planning by selectively imitating a set of trajectories sampled from itself. Specifically, SIDP introduces a reward-guided self-imitation mechanism that encourages the policy to consistently produce high-quality trajectories efficiently, rather than outputs of inconsistent quality, thereby reducing reliance on extensive sampling and post-filtering. During training, we employ a reward-driven curriculum learning paradigm to mitigate inefficient data utility, and goal-agnostic exploration for trajectory augmentation to improve planning robustness. Extensive evaluations on a comprehensive simulation benchmark show that SIDP significantly outperforms previous methods, with real-world experiments confirming its effectiveness across multiple robotic platforms. On Jetson Orin Nano, SIDP delivers a 2.5$\\times$ faster inference than the baseline NavDP, i.e., 110ms VS 273ms, enabling efficient real-time deployment.\n\nSelf-Imitated Diffusion Policy for Efficient and Robust\nVisual Navigation\nRunhua Zhang\n1,2∗\n,\nJunyi Hou\n1,2∗\n,\nChangxu Cheng\n1†\n,\nQiyi Chen\n1\n,\nTao Wang\n1\n,\nWuyue Zhao\n1\n1\nUni-Ubi\n2\nZhejiang University\nAbstract\nDiffusion policies (DP) have demonstrated significant potential in visual navigation by capturing diverse multi-modal trajectory distributions.\nHowever, standard imitation learning (IL), which most DP methods rely on for training, often inherits sub-optimality and redundancy from expert demonstrations, thereby n",

            "answer": "## 论文核心分析\n\n### **一、 论文想解决的核心问题**\n论文旨在解决**基于扩散模型的视觉导航策略**在训练和推理阶段存在的两个关键瓶颈：\n1.  **鲁棒性不足**：传统的模仿学习依赖于有限的专家演示数据集，导致策略在面对分布外场景（如新环境、复杂布局）时泛化能力差，容易失败。\n2.  **推理效率低下**：标准模仿学习会模仿所有专家轨迹（包括次优和冗余的），导致策略生成的轨迹质量参差不齐。为了获得可行路径，现有方法通常采用 **“先生成-后过滤”** 的推理流程，即生成大量候选轨迹，再通过一个额外的选择器进行筛选。这带来了巨大的计算开销，尤其在资源受限的边缘设备上，难以实现实时部署。\n\n### **二、 核心创新点：自模仿扩散策略**\n论文提出了 **自模仿扩散策略** 框架，其核心创新在于**用“自我模仿”取代“专家模仿”**，从根本上重塑了策略的学习方式。\n\n**核心机制：奖励引导的自模仿**\n- **传统方法**：从固定的专家数据集中学习。\n- **SIDP方法**：策略从**自身生成**的轨迹中学习。在训练时，策略会生成一批候选轨迹，然后根据一个**奖励函数**（评估轨迹的安全性、效率等，见表I）对这些轨迹进行排序和加权，最后策略模仿那些高奖励的轨迹。\n- **数学本质**：通过重要性采样和基于奖励的权重分配，将策略优化问题转化为一个**加权去噪损失**的最小化问题，使策略分布逐渐向高质量轨迹分布对齐。\n\n### **三、 解决方案的三大支柱**\nSIDP通过一个完整的框架来解决上述问题，具体包含以下三个核心组成部分：\n\n1.  **奖励引导的自模仿学习机制**\n    - **如何工作**：策略`π_θ`生成N条候选轨迹 → 用奖励函数`r(s, a)`评估每条轨迹 → 对奖励进行Softmax归一化得到重要性权重`w(a)` → 用加权损失`ℒ_SIDP`（公式8）更新策略，使其更倾向于生成高奖励轨迹。\n    - **解决什么问题**：\n        - **提升鲁棒性**：通过持续从自身的高质量成功经验中学习，策略能不断自我改进，超越固定专家数据集的偏差，适应更广泛的环境。\n        - **提升效率**：该过程促使策略的轨迹分布发生 **“分布集中”** —— 即减少次优模式，同时保留通往目标的多条优质路径。这使得推理时**无需**生成大量样本再进行过滤，**直接输出**的轨迹质量就很高。\n\n2.  **目标无关的探索**\n    - **如何工作**：在训练中，随机生成一些辅助目标点，让策略在不指定具体目标的情况下进行探索，生成多样化的轨迹。\n    - **解决什么问题**：\n        - **增强数据多样性**：扩充训练轨迹池，防止策略过拟合到狭窄的路径分布。\n        - **起到正则化作用**：提升策略在指定目标导航任务中的泛化能力和安全性。\n\n3.  **奖励驱动的课程学习**\n    - **如何工作**：动态选择训练场景。只选择那些当前策略能获得一定奖励（`R_max`）且奖励方差足够大（`R_range`）的场景进行训练。\n    - **解决什么问题**：\n        - **提高数据利用效率**：避免在过于简单（无学习价值）或过于困难（全是失败经验）的场景上浪费计算资源。\n        - **促进稳定收敛**：为策略提供难度渐增、信息量丰富的学习样本，引导其更稳定地优化。\n\n### **四、 带来的实际价值与效果**\n- **性能提升**：在InternVLA-N1 S1基准测试中，**SR**和**SPL**指标全面超越基线方法（如NavDP），尤其在复杂的商业和家庭场景中优势显著（SR提升约10%）。\n- **效率飞跃**：由于推理时摒弃了额外的选择器，并得益于分布集中，可以使用更高效的**DDIM采样器**和更少的去噪步数。在Jetson Orin Nano边缘设备上，实现了**2.5倍的推理加速**（从273ms降至110ms），为实时机器人部署铺平道路。\n- **鲁棒性验证**：在仿真到实物的迁移中，在轮式和四足机器人平台上均展示了有效的、无碰撞的视觉导航能力。\n\n**总结**：SIDP的创新在于将扩散模型的强大生成能力与**在线、自省、奖励驱动**的学习范式相结合。它不再被动模仿专家，而是主动探索环境并从自身的最佳实践中学习，从而同时攻克了视觉导航中**鲁棒性**与**实时性**两大难题，为实际机器人应用提供了一个高效、可靠的端到端路径规划解决方案。",

            "answer": "## 视觉导航中扩散策略的发展脉络分析\n\n基于论文《Self-Imitated Diffusion Policy for Efficient and Robust Visual Navigation》及其引用的相关工作，可以梳理出视觉导航中扩散策略（Diffusion Policy）这一方向的发展脉络。其演进主要沿着**两个核心驱动力**展开：**1) 提升规划性能（成功率、鲁棒性）** 和 **2) 提升系统效率（推理速度、部署便捷性）**。每一步的改进都旨在解决前序工作的关键瓶颈。\n\n以下是该方向的主要发展阶段、代表性工作及其核心改进：\n\n### 阶段一：奠基与引入——将扩散模型应用于序列决策\n*   **代表工作**：**Diffuser** (Janner et al., 2022), **Decision Diffuser** (Ajay et al., 2023)\n*   **核心改进**：\n    *   **从自回归模型到生成式建模**：传统方法（如基于RNN/Transformer的自回归模型）逐步预测动作，容易产生误差累积。扩散模型首次被用于**直接生成完整的轨迹序列**，通过迭代去噪过程保证了轨迹的时空一致性。\n    *   **捕获多模态分布**：扩散模型的生成特性使其能够自然地建模复杂环境下通往目标的**多种可行路径分布**，为规划提供了丰富的候选方案。\n    *   **灵活的条件控制**：通过将回报（reward）或约束作为条件输入，引导模型生成高性能或安全的轨迹。\n\n### 阶段二：应用于视觉导航——解决具体任务挑战\n*   **代表工作**：**NoMaD** (Sridhar et al., 2024), **NavDP** (Cai et al., 2025)\n*   **核心改进**：\n    *   **与视觉感知端到端结合**：将扩散策略直接应用于以RGB-D图像为输入的视觉导航任务，实现了从感知到规划的端到端学习。\n    *   **利用特权信息**：以NavDP为例，在仿真训练中利用**特权信息**（如全局地图、精确位置）来引导扩散过程，生成更合理的轨迹，以解决从仿真到现实（Sim-to-Real）的迁移难题。\n    *   **探索与规划的统一**：如NoMaD通过目标掩码（goal masking）技术，使同一个模型既能进行目标导向的导航，也能进行无目标探索，增强了模型的通用性。\n\n### 阶段三：优化推理流程——应对“生成-后过滤”瓶颈\n*   **问题凸显**：前期扩散策略在推理时，为了从多模态分布中选出一个高质量轨迹，普遍采用 **“生成-后过滤”** 范式。即先通过随机采样生成大量（如16个）轨迹候选，再依赖一个**额外的选择器**（auxiliary selector，可以是基于规则的或学习的）来筛选最优轨迹。\n*   **带来的挑战**：\n    1.  **计算开销大**：多次采样和额外的选择网络显著增加了推理延迟，难以在资源受限的边缘设备（如机器人嵌入式平台）上实时运行。\n    2.  **架构复杂**：需要训练和维护策略网络和选择器网络两套系统。\n    3.  **质量不稳定**：策略本身可能生成大量低质量（碰撞、绕远）的轨迹，完全依赖后置过滤来保证安全与效率。\n\n### 阶段四：根本性范式创新——从“模仿专家”到“自我进化”\n这是本文**SIDP**工作所处的阶段，它代表了当前一个重要的前沿发展方向。\n\n*   **代表工作**：**Self-Imitated Diffusion Policy (SIDP)** (本文)\n*   **核心改进（针对前述所有瓶颈）**：\n    *   **训练范式革命：从模仿学习到自模仿学习**\n        *   **之前**：NavDP等依赖**模仿学习**，其性能上限受限于专家数据集的质量、覆盖度和可能存在的次优性。\n        *   **SIDP**：提出**奖励引导的自模仿**机制。策略不再模仿固定数据集，而是从**自身当前策略采样**的轨迹中，根据奖励函数筛选出高质量部分进行模仿。这形成了一个**自我迭代优化**的闭环，使策略能不断超越初始数据，学习到更优的行为。\n    *   **实现分布集中，彻底摒弃选择器**\n        *   **之前**：策略输出分布广泛且质量不均，必须后过滤。\n        *   **SIDP**：通过持续模仿自身的高奖励轨迹，策略的轨迹输出分布会自然地向**高质量区域集中**（保持模态间多样性，但提升模态内质量）。因此，在推理时**只需做一次确定性采样**即可得到可靠轨迹，移除了整个选择器模块，实现了真正的端到端规划。\n    *   **大幅提升推理效率**\n        *   由于分布集中且质量高，SIDP可以安全地使用**DDIM**等确定性采样算法，并**大幅减少去噪步数**（从10步减至5步甚至3步）。这是其能在Jetson Orin Nano上实现**2.5倍加速**（110ms vs 273ms）的根本原因。\n    *   **增强鲁棒性与泛化性**\n        *   通过**目标无关探索**策略，让策略在训练中学习不依赖特定目标的探索行为，增加了训练数据的多样性，起到了正则化作用，提升了在陌生环境中的泛化能力。\n        *   通过**奖励驱动的课程学习**，动态选择对当前策略学习潜力最大的训练场景，提升了数据利用效率，加速了收敛并避免了局部最优。\n\n### 其他并行发展方向\n论文中也提到了其他一些并行的技术演进路径：\n\n1.  **与经典规划器融合**：\n    *   **代表**：LDP (Yu et al., 2024), Motion Planning Diffusion (Carvalho et al., 2024)\n    *   **改进**：将扩散模型作为局部规划器或轨迹优化器，嵌入到基于地图的经典规划框架（如A*、RRT*）中。利用扩散模型处理复杂约束和生成平滑轨迹的能力，弥补传统采样或搜索方法在复杂动态环境中的不足。\n\n2.  **采样过程引导**：\n    *   **代表**：NaviDiffusor (Zeng et al., 2025), CGD (Kondo et al., 2024)\n    *   **改进**：在扩散模型的采样（去噪）过程中，实时注入基于成本函数、安全约束或探索激励的**梯度引导**，从而在不重新训练模型的情况下，对生成的轨迹进行实时微调，使其满足特定任务需求。\n\n### 总结脉络图\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[奠基: 扩散模型用于决策<br>Diffuser/Decision Diffuser] --> B[应用: 视觉导航端到端化<br>NoMaD/NavDP]；\n    B --> C[问题凸显: “生成-后过滤”范式<br>推理慢、需选择器]；\n    C --> D1[范式创新: 自模仿学习<br>**SIDP (本文)**]；\n    C --> D2[路径融合: 与经典规划结合<br>LDP]；\n    C --> D3[过程优化: 引导采样<br>NaviDiffusor]；\n\n    D1 --> E1[核心贡献: <br>1. 自我迭代优化，超越专家数据<br>2. 分布集中，**实现单次采样**<br>3. **推理效率大幅提升**<br>4. 鲁棒性与泛化性增强]；\n    D2 --> E2[核心贡献: <br>结合扩散的灵活性与<br>经典规划的全局性/可靠性]；\n    D3 --> E3[核心贡献: <br>在推理时动态调整轨迹，<br>满足即时约束]；\n```\n\n**结论**：视觉导航中的扩散策略研究，正从最初的“证明概念可行”，快速演进到“解决实际部署难题”。**SIDP**代表了一种根本性的思路转变——通过改变训练范式（自模仿）来直接优化策略的内在质量，从而一劳永逸地解决了推理效率的瓶颈。与此同时，与其他领域（经典规划、约束优化）的交叉融合，也为扩散规划器提供了更广阔的应用前景和更强的实用性。未来的发展很可能继续围绕**效率与鲁棒性的极致平衡**、**更少的数据依赖**以及**在复杂物理世界中的可靠部署**展开。",

            "answer": "好的，作为一名专业的学术论文分析助手，我将为您详细分析《Self-Imitated Diffusion Policy for Efficient and Robust Visual Navigation》这篇论文提出的关键技术方法。\n\n## 论文核心方法分析\n\n本文的核心创新在于提出了 **自模仿扩散策略（Self-Imitated Diffusion Policy, SIDP）** 框架，旨在解决传统模仿学习（IL）训练扩散策略时存在的**次优性、冗余性**以及由此导致的**推理效率低下**问题。其关键技术方法可归纳为以下三个相互关联的部分：\n\n### 1. 奖励引导的自模仿机制 (Reward-Guided Self-Imitation)\n\n这是SIDP框架的核心，旨在通过**自我生成并筛选高质量轨迹**来迭代优化策略，替代对固定专家数据的模仿。\n\n| 技术组件 | 具体细节与数学原理 | 关键参数与设置 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **问题重述为分布匹配** | 将策略优化目标（最大化期望奖励）转化为使策略分布 \\(\\pi_\\theta(a\\|s_t)\\) 逼近最优轨迹分布 \\(p^*(a\\|s_t)\\) 的问题。通过最小化KL散度：<br> \\(\\arg\\min_\\theta D_{KL}(p^* \\| \\pi_\\theta) = \\arg\\max_\\theta \\mathbb{E}_{a \\sim p^*} [\\log \\pi_\\theta(a\\|s_t)]\\) <br> 由于 \\(p^*\\) 未知，使用当前策略 \\(\\pi_\\theta\\) 作为提议分布进行重要性采样。 | - |\n| **重要性权重推导** | 基于**相对熵策略搜索（REPS）**框架，在KL散度信任域约束下，最大化期望奖励的最优分布具有解析形式：<br> \\(p^*(a\\|s_t) \\propto \\pi_\\theta(a\\|s_t) \\exp\\left(\\frac{r(s_t, a)}{\\tau}\\right)\\) <br> 其中 \\(\\tau\\) 是温度参数。重要性权重为似然比 \\(w = p^* / \\pi_\\theta\\)，因此：<br> \\(w(a) \\propto \\exp\\left(\\frac{r(s_t, a)}{\\tau}\\right)\\) | **温度参数 \\(\\tau\\)**：控制选择“锐度”。论文通过实验确定 \\(\\tau = 1.0\\) 时效果最佳。 |\n| **Top-k截断与权重归一化** | 为降低指数权重带来的高方差，仅保留奖励最高的 \\(k\\) 个候选轨迹，并对它们的权重进行Softmax归一化，得到最终用于训练的重要性权重：<br> \\(w(a_t^{(i)}) = \\frac{\\exp(r(s_t, a_t^{(i)}) / \\tau)}{\\sum_{j=1}^k \\exp(r(s_t, a_t^{(j)}) / \\tau)}\\) | **候选数 \\(N\\)**：每次从策略中采样的轨迹总数。<br> **截断数 \\(k\\)**：保留用于训练的高质量轨迹数。 |\n| **自模仿扩散损失函数** | 将最大化加权对数似然的目标，转化为最小化**奖励加权的去噪损失**。这是SIDP的核心训练目标：<br> \\(\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{SIDP}} = \\sum_{i=1}^k w(a_t^{(i)}) \\mathbb{E}_{t_{dn}, \\epsilon} \\left[ \\| \\epsilon - \\epsilon_\\theta(a_t^{(i), t_{dn}}, t_{dn}, s_t) \\|_2^2 \\right]\\) <br> 其中 \\(t_{dn}\\) 是扩散时间步，\\(\\epsilon\\) 是添加的噪声，\\(\\epsilon_\\theta\\) 是去噪网络。该损失使策略更倾向于生成高奖励轨迹。 | 损失函数形式继承自DDPM，但引入了样本权重 \\(w\\)。 |\n| **奖励函数设计** | 奖励 \\(r(s_t, a_t)\\) 是引导自模仿的关键信号，由四个部分组成（详见论文表I）：<br> 1. **安全奖励 \\(r_{\\text{col}}\\)**：发生碰撞时给予大额惩罚。<br> 2. **步长成本 \\(r_{\\text{step}}\\)**：惩罚路径长度，鼓励高效。<br> 3. **进度奖励 \\(r_{\\text{prog}}\\)**：奖励向目标靠近的几何距离减少量。<br> 4. **停靠奖励 \\(r_{\\text{dock}}\\)**：在接近目标时（<0.5m）提供细粒度引导。 | \\(\\lambda_{\\text{col}}=10, \\lambda_{\\text{step}}=0.5, \\lambda_{\\text{prog}}=5, \\lambda_{\\text{dock}}=10\\) <br> 精细停靠区域 \\(\\delta_{\\text{fine}} = 0.5m\\) |\n\n### 2. 目标无关探索 (Goal-Agnostic Exploration)\n\n此策略用于**增强数据多样性**并**正则化**点目标导航任务，防止过拟合。\n\n| 技术组件 | 具体细节与数学原理 | 关键参数与设置 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **数据生成流程** | 1. **采样辅助目标点**：在智能体初始位置周围，按均匀分布采样角度（-60° ~ 60°）和距离（3m ~ 5m）生成临时目标。<br>2. **策略生成轨迹**：使用当前策略 \\(\\pi_\\theta\\)，将输入状态 \\(s_t\\) 中的真实目标 \\(g_t\\) 替换为一个特殊的“目标无关”嵌入，生成通往临时目标的轨迹。 | 角度范围：[-60°, 60°]；距离范围：[3m, 5m]。 |\n| **训练集成** | 在训练前向传播中，这些轨迹与点目标导航轨迹混合。对于目标无关轨迹，在计算自模仿损失时，**将其重要性权重 \\(w\\) 设置为均匀分布**（即所有样本平等对待）。这使得策略学习安全、合理的运动模式，而不受特定目标点的束缚。 | 目标无关嵌入：一个固定的特殊向量，用于替换输入中的 \\(g_t\\)。 |\n\n### 3. 奖励驱动的课程学习 (Reward-Driven Curriculum Learning)\n\n此策略用于**动态选择训练样本**，提高数据利用效率，促进稳定收敛。\n\n| 技术组件 | 具体细节与数学原理 | 关键参数与设置 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **场景潜力评估** | 对每个训练场景 \\(s_i\\)，通过当前策略采样一批轨迹，计算两个指标：<br>1. **最大奖励 \\(R_{\\text{max}}(s_i)\\)**：该场景下能获得的最佳表现，反映**学习可行性**。<br>2. **奖励范围 \\(R_{\\text{range}}(s_i)\\)**：最高奖励与最低奖励之差，反映**梯度信息的丰富度**（区分度）。 | - |\n| **动态选择条件** | 仅当场景同时满足以下两个条件时，才被选入当前训练批次：<br> \\(R_{\\text{max}}(s_i) \\geq \\tau_{\\text{max}}\\) **且** \\(R_{\\text{range}}(s_i) \\geq \\tau_{\\text{range}}\\) <br> - **高 \\(\\tau_{\\text{max}}\\)** 确保策略不会在过于困难、总是失败的场景上浪费时间。<br> - **高 \\(\\tau_{\\text{range}}\\)** 确保场景能提供具有区分度的样本，促进策略优化效率而非仅仅完成任务。 | 阈值 \\(\\tau_{\\text{max}}\\) 和 \\(\\tau_{\\text{range}}\\) 在论文中未给出具体数值，需根据实际训练动态调整或设定。 |\n\n## 技术创新与实际价值总结\n\n1.  **根本性范式转变**：从“模仿固定的专家数据”转变为“模仿自我生成的高质量经验”，解决了专家数据次优、覆盖有限的根本瓶颈。\n2.  **实现分布集中**：通过奖励加权，策略分布逐渐向高奖励区域集中，减少了生成轨迹的方差和次优模态，从而**在推理时无需进行“生成-后过滤”**，实现了端到端的高效规划。\n3.  **稳定高效的优化**：将复杂的、需要贯穿扩散时间步反向传播（BPTT）的强化学习式优化，转化为稳定的加权模仿学习问题，大大降低了训练难度和计算成本。\n4.  **显著的性能与效率提升**：\n    *   **性能**：在复杂场景（如Commercial）上相比基线（NavDP）有近10个百分点的成功率提升，证明了其卓越的泛化与鲁棒性。\n    *   **效率**：由于分布集中，可以使用更少的去噪步数（如DDIM 5步）进行确定性采样，在Jetson Orin Nano上实现**2.5倍**的推理加速（110ms vs 273ms），满足了实时机器人部署的严苛要求。\n\n这些方法共同构成了一个完整、高效且鲁棒的视觉导航策略学习框架，兼具理论创新和极高的实际应用价值。",

            "question": "论文的主要局限性有哪些？未来可能的改进方向是什么？",
            "answer": "## 论文主要局限性分析\n\n基于对《Self-Imitated Diffusion Policy for Efficient and Robust Visual Navigation》全文的深入分析，本文提出的SIDP框架虽然取得了显著成果，但仍存在以下主要局限性：\n\n- **仿真到现实的泛化能力仍需进一步验证**：尽管论文在真实机器人平台（Unitree Go2, Agilex T-rex）上进行了部署测试，并展示了在办公室、走廊等环境中的成功案例，但这些测试场景相对有限。论文未系统性地量化评估在**极端光照变化、动态障碍物（如移动的行人）、严重视觉退化（如烟雾、镜面反射）或全新未知建筑结构**下的性能。当前的“sim-to-real”迁移主要依赖于在高质量仿真数据集（InternData-N1）上的训练和深度估计网络（BANet）的辅助，其面对真实世界无限长尾分布问题的鲁棒性尚未得到充分证明。\n\n- **奖励函数的设计依赖先验知识与手工调整**：SIDP的核心依赖于一个精心设计的奖励函数（见表I），该函数包含了碰撞惩罚、步长成本、进度奖励和停靠奖励等多个手工加权（`λ_col=10, λ_step=0.5, ...`）的组件。这种设计存在两个问题：\n    1. **主观性与场景依赖性**：奖励权重需要根据任务和场景进行调优，可能无法泛化到所有导航任务（如需要不同安全/效率权衡的场合）。\n    2. **稀疏奖励下的探索问题**：对于非常长视距或结构复杂的导航任务，基于最终结果的稀疏奖励可能使“自我模仿”机制在初期难以采样到高质量轨迹，从而影响学习效率。论文中通过“目标无关探索”部分缓解了此问题，但未从根本上解决。\n\n- **训练过程计算成本依然较高**：虽然SIDP大幅提升了**推理效率**，但其**训练过程**仍需要大量计算资源。论文提到训练耗时约35小时，使用了两块NVIDIA A100 GPU。这主要源于其“在线采样-评估-更新”的循环需要与环境进行大量交互来生成候选轨迹并计算奖励。对于需要快速迭代或数据有限的现实应用，这种训练开销可能是一个瓶颈。\n\n- **策略的表达能力与复杂多模态场景的平衡**：SIDP通过自我模仿机制促使轨迹分布“**类内收敛**”，以提升推理效率。虽然论文强调保留了“**类间多样性**”，但这种对高质量轨迹的聚焦在极端多模态场景下（如存在多个同等最优但截然不同的路径）可能会**过早地抑制探索**，导致策略收敛到某个局部最优模式，而无法发现其他同样有效的路径。论文的评估主要关注成功率和路径长度，对“发现所有可行解”的能力评估不足。\n\n- **对精确深度信息的依赖**：模型输入状态 `s_t` 包含RGB-D图像，其中深度图 `I_t^D` 在真实世界中由立体视觉和BANet网络估计得到。这意味着系统的性能与深度估计的准确性紧密耦合。在缺乏纹理、透明或反射表面等深度估计容易失效的场景，导航性能可能会显著下降。论文未探讨在仅有RGB输入或深度信息严重噪声情况下的性能。\n\n---\n\n## 未来可能的改进方向\n\n针对上述局限性，未来的研究工作可以从以下几个方向展开：\n\n- **增强仿真到现实的迁移与泛化能力**：\n    - 开发更**多样化、对抗性更强的仿真基准**，涵盖更极端的视觉条件、动态元素和语义变化。\n    - 引入**领域随机化** 或 **领域自适应技术**，在训练阶段主动模拟真实世界的变异，使策略对感知不确定性更加鲁棒。\n    - 结合**在线自适应机制**，让机器人在部署后能利用少量真实交互数据持续微调策略。\n\n- **优化奖励设计与学习范式**：\n    - 探索**逆强化学习**或**基于能量的模型**，从专家数据或成功轨迹中**自动学习奖励函数**，减少对手工设计的依赖。\n    - 研究**分层强化学习**与扩散模型的结合，将长视距任务分解为子目标，缓解稀疏奖励问题。\n    - 尝试将**语言指令**或**语义地图**作为条件输入，实现更泛化、更易指定的任务目标，超越简单的点目标导航。\n\n- **提升训练与采样效率**：\n    - 设计**更高效的离线自我模仿算法**，例如构建一个不断扩大的**高质量轨迹回放缓冲区**，减少每次迭代所需的在线采样数量。\n    - 探索**模型预测控制**框架，将SIDP作为短视距规划器进行滚动优化，结合轻量级的世界模型进行轨迹推演，进一步减少对大规模采样的依赖。\n\n- **平衡效率与多模态表达能力**：\n    - 在损失函数中引入**可控的多样性正则项**，明确鼓励策略在保持高质量的同时覆盖不同的行为模式。\n    - 研究**条件生成机制**，例如通过潜在变量或技能编码，允许用户在推理时显式指定或选择期望的路径模式（如“激进”或“保守”）。\n\n- **降低对完美感知的依赖**：\n    - 开发**基于纯RGB或稀疏深度**输入的SIDP变体，利用视觉-语言模型或几何先验来弥补深度信息的缺失。\n    - 将**不确定性估计**模块集成到策略中，使规划过程能够感知并处理感知置信度，在不确定区域采取更保守的策略。\n\n- **拓展任务范围与智能水平**：\n    - 将SIDP框架应用于**具身智能**中更复杂的任务，如**物体操作导航**、**多任务连续导航**或**人机协作导航**。\n    - 探索与**大语言模型**或**视觉-语言模型**的深度融合，实现基于自然语言指令的开放世界导航与推理。\n\n**总结**：SIDP在提升扩散策略的推理效率和训练鲁棒性方面迈出了重要一步，但其在**极端泛化性、奖励设计自动化、训练成本以及复杂多模态平衡**等方面仍面临挑战。未来的工作应致力于构建**更自适应、更高效、对感知缺陷更鲁棒**，且能处理**更开放、更复杂任务**的下一代视觉导航系统。",
