Nevertheless, as they are still built upon diffusion models, which typically require hundreds of iterative denoising steps to generate a single action\n(Sohl-Dickstein et al.,\n2015\n; Ho et al.,\n2020\n)\n, they remain impractical for real-time robotic control.\nTo overcome this limitation, we turn to Flow Matching\n(Lipman et al.,\n2023\n)\n, a recent class of generative models that learns a continuous trajectory from a simple prior distribution to the data distribution using an ordinary differential equation (ODE) defined by a velocity field.\nCompared to diffusion models, flow-based approaches offer better numerical stability and faster inference, making them highly appealing for efficient embodied AI.\nWe present EfficientFlow, a new policy learning framework that unifies equivariant learning and flow-based generative modeling.\nWe first investigate how to incorporate equivariance into flow-based policy models and theoretically show that, under an isotropic Gaussian prior and an equivariant velocity field network, the conditional action distribution induced by flow matching remains equivariant with respect to input observation transformations (see Figure\n1\n(a)).\nThis property allows policies to generalize across symmetric configurations of the environment without additional supervision or data augmentation.\nTo further improve the action sampling efficiency, we introduce a regularization technique that penalizes the acceleration of the generation flow trajectory, i.e., the second-order temporal derivative, which encourages a smoother and more stable action sampling process.\nHowever, computing acceleration requires consecutive points along the marginal flow trajectories, which are unavailable in the standard flow matching framework.\nTo address this challenge, we propose a novel surrogate objective called Flow Acceleration Upper Bound (FABO).\nFABO provides a practical and effective approximation of the acceleration penalty using only conditional flow trajectories available during training, enabling much faster flow policies with lower computational costs.\nThe proposed EfficientFlow combines the best of both worlds: it achieves fast inference speed thanks to the flow-based architecture and smoothed sampling trajectory, and maintains high performance by leveraging equivariance.\nAs illustrated in Figure\n1\n(b), EfficientFlow compares favorably against existing methods in both inference speed and task success rates.\nOur primary contributions are as follows:\n•\nWe formulate a flow-based policy learning framework, EfficientFlow, that achieves equivariance to geometric transformations, allowing the model to generalize across symmetric states and significantly improve data efficiency. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that equivariance is preserved in the flow framework when using an isotropic prior and an equivariant velocity field conditioned on visual observations.\n•\nTo promote sampling speed, we propose a second-order regularization objective that penalizes flow acceleration. Since direct acceleration computation requires access to neighboring marginal samples that are unavailable, we introduce a novel surrogate loss called FABO, enabling effective training.\n•\nWe provide comprehensive evaluations of EfficientFlow on 12 robotic manipulation tasks in the MimicGen\n(Mandlekar et al.,\n2023\n)\nbenchmark, showing that EfficientFlow achieves favorable success rates with high inference speeds (19.9 to 56.1 times faster than EquiDiff\n(Wang et al.,\n2024\n)\n).\nFigure 1\n:\nWe propose EfficientFlow (a) to effectively combine equivariance with Flow Policy and introduce an acceleration regularization to achieve high-quality, fast action generation. As shown in (b), EfficientFlow compares favorably against baseline policy learning approaches in both success rate and inference speed. Results are from MimicGen with 100 training demonstrations.\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\nEquivariance in Robot Manipulation\nApplying equivariance to robot manipulation is a highly promising research direction, and multiple studies have demonstrated that it can significantly enhance the data efficiency of robot policy learning\n(Wang et al.,\n2022b\n; Jia et al.,\n2023\n; Wang et al.,\n2022c\n; Simeonov et al.,\n2023\n; Pan et al.,\n2023\n; Huang et al.,\n2023\n; Liu et al.,\n2023a\n; Kim et al.,\n2023\n; Nguyen et al.,\n2023\n; Yang et al.,\n2024a\n)\n. Early work used SE(3) open-loop or SE(2) closed-loop for control, validated the effectiveness of equivariant models in on-robot learning\n(Zhu & Wang,\n2022\n; Wang et al.,\n2022a\n; Zhu et al.,\n2023\n)\n, and achieved pick-and-place tasks based on few-shot demonstrations\n(Huang et al.,\n2022\n; Simeonov et al.,\n2022\n; Ryu et al.,\n2023\n; Huang et al.,\n2024\n)\n.\nBuilding on this foundation, EquiDiff\n(Wang et al.,\n2024\n)\nextend the research to the SE(3) closed-loop action space, substantially improving the efficiency of imitation learning by integrating symmetry with diffusion policies. However, the DDPM architecture employed by EquiDiff requires a multi-step denoising process, resulting in slow inference speeds. In contrast, the EfficientFlow model marks a significant breakthrough in inference efficiency, attaining higher success rates than EquiDiff with only a minimal number of inference steps.\n2.2\nFlow Policy\nFlow Matching\n(Lipman et al.,\n2023\n)\nrepresents a novel class of generative models grounded in optimal transport theory. Its objective is to learn a vector field of a probability path, which is more efficient than diffusion paths, offering faster training and sampling, alongside better generalization capabilities. Compared to diffusion models, Flow Matching significantly reduces the number of inference steps, a critical factor for real-world robotic operations, thereby substantially broadening the applicability of such models. The work Flow Policy\n(Zhang et al.,\n2025\n)\nintroduced conditional Consistent Flow Matching\n(Yang et al.,\n2024b\n)\nto robotic manipulation. Conditioned on observed 3D point clouds, Flow Policy utilizes Consistency Flow Matching to directly define straight-line flows from different temporal states to the same action space, concurrently constraining their velocity values. It approximates trajectories from noise to robot actions by normalizing the self-consistency of the velocity field within the action space, thereby enhancing inference efficiency. MP1\n(Sheng et al.,\n2025\n)\nleverages Mean Flow\n(Geng et al.,\n2025\n)\nto shrink policy learning to a single state-action step, while a lightweight Dispersive Loss repels state embeddings. This combination steadies the flow field and delivers millisecond inference that outpaces DP3 and Flow Policy. Currently, many VLA (Vision-Language-Action) models\n(Black et al.,\n2024\n; Gao et al.,\n2025\n; Bjorck et al.,\n2025\n; Reuss et al.,\n2025\n)\nare utilizing flow matching policies and have achieved good results.\n3\nMethod\n3.1\nPreliminaries\n3.1.1\nFlow Matching\nThe core idea of Flow Matching\n(Lipman et al.,\n2023\n)\nis to learn the vector field of an ODE that smoothly transforms samples\nx\n0\nx_{0}\nfrom a simple prior distribution\np\n0\np_{0}\n(e.g., Gaussian noise) to samples\nx\n1\nx_{1}\nfrom a target data distribution\np\n1\np_{1}\n.\nSpecifically, let\n{\np\nt\n}\nt\n∈\n[\n0\n,\n1\n]\n\\{p_{t}\\}_{t\\in[0,1]}\nbe a time-evolving family of probability distributions satisfying the boundary conditions\np\nt\n=\n0\n=\np\n0\np_{t=0}=p_{0}\nand\np\nt\n=\n1\n=\np\n1\np_{t=1}=p_{1}\n. This path induces an underlying ground-truth instantaneous velocity field\nu\ngt\n​\n(\nt\n,\nx\n)\nu^{\\text{gt}}(t,x)\n.\nFlow Matching aims to learn a vector field\nu\nθ\n​\n(\nt\n,\nx\n)\nu_{\\theta}(t,x)\nparameterized by\nθ\n\\theta\n, such that trajectories\nx\nt\nx_{t}\ndefined by the following ODE:\n{\nd\n​\nx\nt\nd\n​\nt\n=\nu\nθ\n​\n(\nt\n,\nx\nt\n)\nx\n0\n∼\np\n0\n\\begin{cases}\\frac{dx_{t}}{dt}=u_{\\theta}(t,x_{t})\\\\\nx_{0}\\sim p_{0}\\end{cases}\n(1)\ncan effectively transport the prior distribution\np\n0\np_{0}\nto the target distribution\np\n1\np_{1}\n.\nIdeally, the learned vector field\nu\nθ\n​\n(\nt\n,\nx\n)\nu_{\\theta}(t,x)\nshould approximate the true vector field\nu\ngt\n​\n(\nt\n,\nx\n)\nu^{\\text{gt}}(t,x)\n.\nThus, a natural learning objective for Flow Matching is:\nL\nFM\n=\n𝔼\nt\n,\nx\nt\n​\n[\n‖\nu\nθ\n​\n(\nt\n,\nx\nt\n)\n−\nu\ngt\n​\n(\nt\n,\nx\nt\n)\n‖\n2\n2\n]\n,\nL_{\\text{FM}}=\\mathbb{E}_{t,x_{t}}\\left[\\left\\|u_{\\theta}(t,x_{t})-u^{\\text{gt}}(t,x_{t})\\right\\|_{2}^{2}\\right],\n(2)\nwhere\nx\nt\n∼\np\nt\nx_{t}\\sim p_{t}\n.\nAs\nu\ngt\n​\n(\nt\n,\nx\nt\n)\nu^{\\text{gt}}(t,x_{t})\nis generally intractable in practice, Conditional Flow Matching (CFM)\n(Lipman et al.,\n2023\n)\nproposes to learn\nu\nθ\n​\n(\nt\n,\nx\nt\n)\nu_{\\theta}(t,x_{t})\nby regressing against a conditional vector field\nu\n​\n(\nt\n,\nx\nt\n|\nx\n1\n)\nu(t,x_{t}|x_{1})\n, using samples from a conditional probability path\np\nt\n​\n(\nx\n|\nx\n1\n)\np_{t}(x|x_{1})\n.\nThe corresponding objective is:\nL\nCFM\n=\n𝔼\nt\n,\nx\n1\n,\nx\nt\n[\n∥\nu\nθ\n(\nt\n,\nx\nt\n)\n−\nu\n(\nt\n,\nx\nt\n|\nx\n1\n)\n∥\n2\n2\n]\n,\nL_{\\text{CFM}}=\\mathbb{E}_{t,x_{1},x_{t}}\\left[\\left\\|u_{\\theta}(t,x_{t})-u(t,x_{t}|x_{1})\\right\\|_{2}^{2}\\right],\n(3)\nwhere\nt\n∼\nU\n​\n(\n0\n,\n1\n)\n,\nx\n1\n∼\np\n1\n​\n(\nx\n)\nt\\sim U(0,1),x_{1}\\sim p_{1}(x)\n, and\nx\nt\n∼\np\nt\n​\n(\nx\n|\nx\n1\n)\nx_{t}\\sim p_{t}(x|x_{1})\n.\n3.1.2\nEquivariance\nEquivariance is a desirable property in many learning systems, especially when modeling structured data influenced by known symmetries\n(Cesa et al.,\n2022\n)\n.\nA function\nf\nf\nis said to be equivariant with respect to a transformation group\nG\nG\nif it commutes with the actions of the group.\nFormally, this is expressed as:\nf\n​\n(\nρ\nx\n​\n(\ng\n)\n​\nx\n)\n=\nρ\ny\n​\n(\ng\n)\n​\nf\n​\n(\nx\n)\n,\n∀\ng\n∈\nG\n,\nf(\\rho_{x}(g)x)=\\rho_{y}(g)f(x),\\quad\\forall g\\in G,\n(4)\nwhere\nρ\nx\n\\rho_{x}\nand\nρ\ny\n\\rho_{y}\ndenote group representations that describe how the group acts on the input space and output space, respectively. This equation ensures that applying a group transformation to the input and then evaluating the function (Eq.\n4\nleft) yields the same result as first applying the function and then transforming the output (Eq.\n4\nright).\nIn this work, we focus on learning equivariant policies for robot arm control, where the input\nx\nx\nrepresents the robot arm action in the task space.\nSince robotic manipulation tasks often exhibit rotational symmetry\n(Wang et al.,\n2024\n,\n2022b\n)\n, we study the action of the rotation group\nSO\n​\n(\n2\n)\n\\mathrm{SO}(2)\nand its finite cyclic subgroup\nC\nu\n⊂\nSO\n​\n(\n2\n)\nC_{u}\\subset\\text{SO}(2)\n, which models discrete rotational symmetries (e.g., rotations by\n2\n​\nπ\nu\n\\frac{2\\pi}{u}\nradians).\nWe consider the following standard representations:\n1) the trivial representation\nρ\n0\n\\rho_{0}\n, which maps every group element\ng\n∈\nG\ng\\in G\nto the identity transformation. This is typically used when the function output should remain invariant under the group action.\n2) the standard irreducible representation\nρ\n1\n\\rho_{1}\n, which describes the canonical action of\nSO\n​\n(\n2\n)\n\\mathrm{SO}(2)\nor\nC\nu\nC_{u}\non the 2D plane, defined as\nρ\n1\n​\n(\ng\n)\n=\n[\ncos\n⁡\n(\ng\n)\n−\nsin\n⁡\n(\ng\n)\nsin\n⁡\n(\ng\n)\ncos\n⁡\n(\ng\n)\n]\n,\n\\rho_{1}(g)=\\begin{bmatrix}\\cos(g)&-\\sin(g)\\\\\n\\sin(g)&\\cos(g)\\end{bmatrix},\nwhere we slightly abuse the notation to use\ng\ng\nto denote both a group element and its corresponding rotation angle.\nBy designing policy networks that are equivariant under these group actions, we aim to incorporate inductive biases that reflect the underlying symmetries of the robot’s action space. This not only improves sample efficiency but also enhances generalization across real task configurations.\nFigure 2\n:\nOverview of EfficientFlow. At each decision step, the policy utilizes the most recent two observation steps\no\nas input. This information is processed by the equivariant Flow Matching network to generate five candidate action trajectories. The trajectory that exhibits the minimum Euclidean distance to the previously predicted trajectory is then selected for execution, ensuring a smooth and coherent action sequence.\n3.2\nEquivariant Flow Policy\nGenerative models for policy learning have received significant attention in recent years. Given an observation\no\no\n, such models can predict a conditional distribution\np\nX\n1\n|\nO\n=\no\np_{X_{1}|O=o}\n, and generate robot actions by sampling\nx\n∼\nX\n1\n|\nO\n=\no\nx\\sim X_{1}\\big|_{O=o}\n, where\nX\n1\nX_{1}\nrepresents the random variable for the action to be executed by the robot arm under the condition that\nO\n=\no\nO=o\n.\nBoth\no\no\nand\nx\nx\ncan span multiple time steps:\no\n=\n[\no\nτ\n−\n(\nm\n−\n1\n)\n,\n⋯\n,\no\nτ\n−\n1\n,\no\nτ\n]\no=[o^{\\tau-(m-1)},\\cdots,o^{\\tau-1},o^{\\tau}]\n,\nx\n=\n[\nx\nτ\n,\nx\nτ\n+\n1\n,\n⋯\n,\nx\nτ\n+\n(\nn\n−\n1\n)\n]\nx=[x^{\\tau},x^{\\tau+1},\\cdots,x^{\\tau+(n-1)}]\n, where\nm\nm\nis the number of historical observations, and\nn\nn\nis the number of future action steps.\nThe observation\no\nτ\no^{\\tau}\nincludes both the image and the robot state at robot time\nτ\n\\tau\n.\nA desirable property for such models is equivariance: when the input\no\no\nis transformed by an element\ng\n∈\nG\ng\\in G\nof a symmetry group (e.g., a rotation), the conditional distribution of the output action should transform accordingly. In other words, symmetry in the observation space should induce symmetry in the action space:\nX\n1\n|\nO\n=\ng\n​\no\n=\nd\ng\n​\n(\nX\n1\n|\nO\n=\no\n)\n,\n\\displaystyle X_{1}\\big|_{O=go}\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle d}}{{=}}g\\left(X_{1}\\big|_{O=o}\\right),\n(5)\nwhere\n=\nd\n\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle d}}{{=}}\ndenotes that the two random variables have the same distribution. We leave the group representation\nρ\n​\n(\ng\n)\n\\rho(g)\nimplicit here and directly use\ng\ng\nfor brevity.\n3.2.1\nHow to Make Flow Policy Equivariant?\nThe main contribution of this work is to demonstrate that the desired property in Eq.\n5\ncan be achieved within the Flow Matching framework by:\n1.\nusing an isotropic distribution for\np\n0\np_{0}\nin Eq.\n1\n, e.g., Gaussian noise\nX\n0\n∼\n𝒩\n​\n(\n0\n,\nI\n)\nX_{0}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,I)\n;\n2.\nusing an equivariant network\nu\nθ\nu_{\\theta}\nfor the velocity field such that:\nu\nθ\n​\n(\nt\n,\ng\n​\nx\n|\ng\n​\no\n)\n=\ng\n​\n(\nu\nθ\n​\n(\nt\n,\nx\n|\no\n)\n)\n,\n∀\ng\n∈\nG\n.\n\\displaystyle u_{\\theta}(t,gx|go)=g\\left(u_{\\theta}(t,x|o)\\right),\\quad\\forall g\\in G.\n(6)\nImportantly, we do\nnot\nimpose the strong assumption that the expert policy in the training data be equivariant, which is in sharp contrast with\n(Wang et al.,\n2024\n)\n.\nTheorem 1\n.\nLet\nG\nG\nbe a transformation group acting on both the observation space and the action space. Suppose the initial distribution\np\n0\np_{0}\nis isotropic, i.e.,\np\n0\n​\n(\ng\n​\nx\n)\n=\np\n0\n​\n(\nx\n)\np_{0}(gx)=p_{0}(x)\nfor all\ng\n∈\nG\ng\\in G\n, and the velocity network\nu\nθ\n​\n(\nt\n,\nx\n|\no\n)\nu_{\\theta}(t,x|o)\nis equivariant as in Eq.\n6\n.\nThen the induced conditional distribution at time\nt\nt\n, given by the flow ODE Eq.\n1\n, satisfies\nX\nt\n|\nO\n=\ng\n​\no\n=\nd\ng\n​\n(\nX\nt\n|\nO\n=\no\n)\n,\nt\n∈\n[\n0\n,\n1\n]\n\\displaystyle X_{t}\\big|_{O=go}\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle d}}{{=}}g\\left(X_{t}\\big|_{O=o}\\right),\\quad t\\in[0,1]\n(7)\ni.e., the output distribution is equivariant under the group action.\nThe special case\nt\n=\n1\nt=1\nof Eq.\n7\ngives us the desired property in Eq.\n5\n.\nAn intuitive visualization of this result is provided in Figure\n1\n(a).\nFrom a discrete-time perspective, consider starting from a randomly sampled initial action\nx\n0\n∼\np\n0\nx_{0}\\sim p_{0}\n. After a small time step\nΔ\n​\nt\n\\Delta t\n, the action evolves under the velocity field to reach\nx\nΔ\n​\nt\n=\nx\n0\n+\nΔ\n​\nt\n⋅\nu\nθ\n​\n(\n0\n,\nx\n0\n|\no\n)\nx_{\\Delta t}=x_{0}+\\Delta t\\cdot u_{\\theta}(0,x_{0}|o)\n.\nThis corresponds to the green curve in Figure\n1\n(a).\nNow, consider a rotated scenario where the initial action is transformed to\nx\n^\n0\n=\ng\n​\nx\n0\n\\hat{x}_{0}=gx_{0}\n, and the observation is rotated accordingly to\ng\n​\no\ngo\n. The updated action becomes\nx\n^\nΔ\n​\nt\n=\n\\displaystyle\\hat{x}_{\\Delta t}=\nx\n^\n0\n+\nΔ\n​\nt\n⋅\nu\nθ\n​\n(\n0\n,\nx\n^\n0\n|\ng\n​\no\n)\n\\displaystyle\\ \\hat{x}_{0}+\\Delta t\\cdot u_{\\theta}(0,\\hat{x}_{0}|go)\n(one-step update)\n=\n\\displaystyle=\ng\n​\nx\n0\n+\nΔ\n​\nt\n⋅\nu\nθ\n​\n(\n0\n,\ng\n​\nx\n0\n|\ng\n​\no\n)\n\\displaystyle\\ gx_{0}+\\Delta t\\cdot u_{\\theta}(0,gx_{0}|go)\n(since\nx\n^\n0\n=\ng\n​\nx\n0\n\\hat{x}_{0}=gx_{0}\n)\n=\n\\displaystyle=\ng\n​\nx\n0\n+\nΔ\n​\nt\n⋅\ng\n​\nu\nθ\n​\n(\n0\n,\nx\n0\n|\no\n)\n\\displaystyle\\ gx_{0}+\\Delta t\\cdot gu_{\\theta}(0,x_{0}|o)\n(Eq.\n6\n)\n=\n\\displaystyle=\ng\n​\nx\nΔ\n​\nt\n.\n\\displaystyle\\ gx_{\\Delta t}.\nThis corresponds to the blue curve in Figure\n1\n(a), showing that the evolution of the rotated action\nx\n^\nt\n\\hat{x}_{t}\nunder the rotated observation\ng\n​\no\ngo\naligns with the rotated evolution of the original action\nx\nt\nx_{t}\n.\nBy repeating this process over the entire flow trajectory, we conclude that\nx\n^\n1\n=\ng\n​\nx\n1\n\\hat{x}_{1}=gx_{1}\n(see Figure\n1\n(a)).\nSince\np\n0\np_{0}\nis isotropic,\nx\n0\nx_{0}\nand\nx\n^\n0\n\\hat{x}_{0}\nhave the same probability density.\nGiven that the flow deterministically transports\nx\n0\nx_{0}\nto\nx\n1\nx_{1}\nand\nx\n^\n0\n\\hat{x}_{0}\nto\nx\n^\n1\n\\hat{x}_{1}\n, it follows that\nx\n1\nx_{1}\nand\nx\n^\n1\n\\hat{x}_{1}\nshare the same density.\nThis implies that the resulting distribution of\nx\n1\nx_{1}\nand\nx\n^\n1\n\\hat{x}_{1}\nrespects the desired equivariance with respect to\ng\ng\n.\nWe emphasize that this is only an intuitive explanation; a rigorous proof is provided in Appendix\nA\n.\nSince standard Flow Matching uses a Gaussian distribution as\np\n0\np_{0}\nby default, the isotropy condition in Theorem\n1\nis automatically satisfied.\nAs a result, making Flow Policy equivariant reduces to designing an equivariant network\nu\nθ\nu_{\\theta}\n.\n3.2.2\nDesign of the Equivariant\nu\nθ\nu_{\\theta}\nTo implement the equivariant policy network\nu\nθ\nu_{\\theta}\n, we leverage the\nescnn\nlibrary\n(Cesa et al.,\n2022\n)\n, which supports constructing neural networks that are equivariant to symmetry groups (planar rotations modeled by SO(2) in our case).\nA critical step in using\nescnn\nis specifying how each output component transforms under group actions, which requires carefully choosing representations that respect the underlying task symmetries.\nIn our setting, the policy outputs an absolute 6-DoF end-effector pose with 3D rotation and 3D translation, along with a scalar gripper width to control a robot arm.\nTo represent the 3D rotation, we adopt the 6D continuous representation\n(Zhou et al.,\n2019\n)\nthat encodes the first two rows of a\n3\n×\n3\n3\\times 3\nrotation matrix, corresponding to the\nx\nx\nand\ny\ny\naxes.\nThis 6D representation can be seen as three 2D vectors in the\nx\nx\n-\ny\ny\nplane, which transform under SO(2) according to the irreducible representation\nρ\n1\n\\rho_{1}\n. Therefore, the 3D rotation component corresponds to\nρ\n1\n3\n\\rho_{1}^{3}\n.\nFor 3D translation, the\nx\nx\nand\ny\ny\ncomponents transform as a 2D vector under SO(2), again corresponding to\nρ\n1\n\\rho_{1}\n, while the\nz\nz\ncomponent remains invariant and is modeled as\nρ\n0\n\\rho_{0}\n.\nThe scalar gripper width is also invariant under planar rotation, corresponding to another\nρ\n0\n\\rho_{0}\n.\nCombining these components, the action vector at robot time\nτ\n\\tau\n, denoted by\nx\nτ\nx^{\\tau}\n, is a 10D vector comprising a 6D rotation representation (first 6 dimensions), a 3D translation vector (next 3 dimensions), and a scalar gripper width (final dimension). The corresponding equivariant representation of the action output is:\ng\n​\nx\nτ\n=\n(\nρ\n1\n3\n⊕\n(\nρ\n1\n⊕\nρ\n0\n)\n⊕\nρ\n0\n)\n​\n(\ng\n)\n​\nx\nτ\n.\ngx^{\\tau}=(\\rho_{1}^{3}\\oplus(\\rho_{1}\\oplus\\rho_{0})\\oplus\\rho_{0})(g)x^{\\tau}.\nThis representation enables\nu\nθ\nu_{\\theta}\nto produce actions that respect the SO(2) symmetry of the task, ensuring consistent behavior under planar rotations of the scene.\n3.2.3\nNetwork Architecture\nAs introduced above, the input of\nu\nθ\nu_{\\theta}\nis flow time\nt\nt\n, action sequence\nx\nt\nx_{t}\n, and observation\no\no\n.\nWe set the equivariant group as a finite cyclic subgroup\nC\nu\n∈\nSO\n​\n(\n2\n)\nC_{u}\\in\\text{SO}(2)\n, and\nu\nu\nis the order of the group.\nWe first use an equivariant observation encoder to map observation\no\no\nto embeddings\ne\no\n∈\nℝ\nu\n×\nd\no\ne_{o}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{u\\times d_{o}}\nand use an equivariant action encoder to map action sequence\nx\nt\nx_{t}\nto embeddings\ne\nx\n∈\nℝ\nu\n×\nd\nx\ne_{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{u\\times d_{x}}\n, where\nd\no\nd_{o}\nand\nd\nx\nd_{x}\nare the feature dimensions associated with each group element.\nThe encoded embeddings\ne\no\n,\ne\nx\ne_{o},e_{x}\n, along with the timestep\nt\nt\n, are fed into a core equivariant neural network. This network, together with the observation and action encoders, parameterizes the conditional vector field\nu\nθ\n​\n(\nt\n,\nx\nt\n,\no\n)\nu_{\\theta}(t,x_{t},o)\n. As all components are designed to be equivariant, the entire mapping process from raw inputs to the predicted vector field strictly adheres to\nC\nu\nC_{u}\nsymmetry.\n3.2.4\nTemporal Consistency\nWhen generating action sequences, adjacent segments are predicted independently. As a result, the policy may switch between different behavioral modes, leading to inconsistencies in long-term execution.\nTo address this, we adopt a temporal overlapping strategy similar to\n(Chi et al.,\n2023\n)\n: only the first\nn\n1\nn_{1}\nsteps of each predicted sequence are executed, while the remaining\nn\n−\nn\n1\nn-n_{1}\nsteps overlap with the subsequent prediction starting from time\nτ\n+\nn\n1\n\\tau+n_{1}\n.\nLong-term consistency can be achieved by generating neighboring action sequences with similar overlap.\nTo this end, we employ a batched trajectory selection and periodic reset strategy, inspired by IMLE Policy\n(Rana et al.,\n2025\n)\n, which balances multi-modal expressivity with temporal coherence.\nDuring inference, we sample\nm\nm\ninitial noise vectors\n{\nx\n0\n,\ni\n}\ni\n=\n1\nm\n\\{x_{0,i}\\}_{i=1}^{m}\nfrom a Gaussian distribution and evolve each through our model to generate\nm\nm\ncandidate action trajectories\n{\nx\n1\n,\ni\n}\ni\n=\n1\nm\n\\{x_{1,i}\\}_{i=1}^{m}\n. We then select the trajectory whose overlapping segment best matches the previous trajectory in the Euclidean sense:\narg\n⁡\nmin\ni\n∈\n1\n,\n…\n,\nm\n⁡\nd\n​\n(\n[\nx\npre\nτ\n+\nn\n1\n,\n…\n,\nx\npre\nτ\n+\nn\n]\n,\n[\nx\n1\n,\ni\nτ\n+\nn\n1\n,\n…\n,\nx\n1\n,\ni\nτ\n+\nn\n]\n)\n,\n\\displaystyle\\arg\\min_{i\\in{1,\\dots,m}}d\\left([x_{\\text{pre}}^{\\tau+n_{1}},\\dots,x_{\\text{pre}}^{\\tau+n}],[x_{1,i}^{\\tau+n_{1}},\\dots,x_{1,i}^{\\tau+n}]\\right),\nwhere we assume the current robot time is\nτ\n+\nn\n1\n\\tau+n_{1}\n, and\nx\npre\nx_{\\text{pre}}\ndenotes the previous action sequence predicted at time\nτ\n\\tau\n, where the steps\nx\npre\nτ\n,\n…\n,\nx\npre\nτ\n+\nn\n1\n−\n1\nx_{\\text{pre}}^{\\tau},\\dots,x_{\\text{pre}}^{\\tau+n_{1}-1}\nhave already been executed.\nTo preserve the model’s ability to explore diverse behaviors, we introduce periodic resets: every 10 prediction cycles, we randomly select one trajectory from the batch for execution, instead of the one that minimizes the overlap distance.\nThis approach improves temporal consistency while maintaining multi-modality, and the batched design ensures minimal overhead in inference time due to parallelization.\n3.3\nAcceleration Regularization\nIn our experiments, we observe that flow-based policies trained solely with the conditional flow matching objective (Eq.\n3\n) tend to perform poorly when the number of function evaluations (NFE) is low. This suggests that the learned flow fields are overly curved, requiring more integration steps for accurate trajectory generation.\nTo address this, we propose an acceleration regularization term that encourages smoother, low-curvature flow trajectories. The underlying intuition is that smoother motion corresponds to smaller second-order derivatives (accelerations) of the trajectory\nx\nt\nx_{t}\n. In the extreme case of zero acceleration, the trajectory becomes a straight line.\nWe augment the training objective as follows:\n𝔼\n[\n∥\nu\nθ\n(\nt\n,\nx\nt\n)\n−\nu\n(\nt\n,\nx\nt\n∣\nx\n1\n)\n∥\n2\n2\n]\n⏟\nData Term\n+\nλ\n​\n𝔼\n​\n[\n‖\nd\n2\n​\nx\nt\nd\n​\nt\n2\n‖\n2\n2\n]\n⏟\nAcceleration Penalty\n,\n\\underbrace{\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left\\|u_{\\theta}(t,x_{t})-u(t,x_{t}\\mid x_{1})\\right\\|_{2}^{2}\\right]}_{\\text{Data Term}}+\\lambda\\!\\!\\!\\underbrace{\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left\\|\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^{2}x_{t}}{\\mathrm{d}t^{2}}\\right\\|_{2}^{2}\\right]}_{\\text{Acceleration Penalty}},\n(8)\nwhere\nλ\n\\lambda\ncontrols the trade-off between fidelity to the target velocity field and trajectory smoothness. In practice, we use a time-dependent weighting\nλ\n​\n(\nt\n)\n=\n(\n1\n−\nt\n)\n2\n\\lambda(t)=(1-t)^{2}\n, which encourages smoother flow at earlier timesteps and prioritizes accuracy as\nt\n→\n1\nt\\to 1\n.\nAccording to Eq.\n1\n, the second derivative term can be rewritten as:\n𝔼\n​\n[\n‖\nd\n2\n​\nx\nt\nd\n​\nt\n2\n‖\n2\n2\n]\n≈\n1\n(\nΔ\n​\nt\n)\n2\n​\n𝔼\n​\n‖\nu\nθ\n​\n(\nt\n,\nx\nt\n)\n−\nu\nθ\n​\n(\nt\n+\nΔ\n​\nt\n,\nx\nt\n+\nΔ\n​\nt\n)\n‖\n2\n2\n,\n\\displaystyle\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left\\|\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^{2}x_{t}}{\\mathrm{d}t^{2}}\\right\\|_{2}^{2}\\right]\\approx\\frac{1}{(\\Delta t)^{2}}\\mathbb{E}\\left\\|u_{\\theta}(t,x_{t})-u_{\\theta}(t+\\Delta t,x_{t+\\Delta t})\\right\\|_{2}^{2},\nwhich, however, cannot be directly evaluated, because\nx\nt\nx_{t}\nand\nx\nt\n+\nΔ\n​\nt\nx_{t+\\Delta t}\nlie on the same underlying marginal trajectory that is unknown.\nTo overcome this, we introduce a practical surrogate regularization, which we call the Flow Acceleration Upper Bound (FABO):\nFABO\n=\n𝔼\n​\n‖\nu\nθ\n​\n(\nt\n,\nx\n~\nt\n)\n−\nu\nθ\n​\n(\nt\n+\nΔ\n​\nt\n,\nx\n~\nt\n+\nΔ\n​\nt\n)\n‖\n2\n2\n≥\n𝔼\n​\n‖\nu\nθ\n​\n(\nt\n,\nx\nt\n)\n−\nu\nθ\n​\n(\nt\n+\nΔ\n​\nt\n,\nx\nt\n+\nΔ\n​\nt\n)\n‖\n2\n2\n,\n\\displaystyle\\text{FABO}=\\mathbb{E}\\left\\|u_{\\theta}(t,\\tilde{x}_{t})-u_{\\theta}(t+\\Delta t,\\tilde{x}_{t+\\Delta t})\\right\\|_{2}^{2}\\geq\\mathbb{E}\\left\\|u_{\\theta}(t,x_{t})-u_{\\theta}(t+\\Delta t,x_{t+\\Delta t})\\right\\|_{2}^{2},\n(9)\nwhen\nΔ\n​\nt\n\\Delta t\nis small.\nNotably,\nx\n~\nt\n\\tilde{x}_{t}\nand\nx\n~\nt\n+\nΔ\n​\nt\n\\tilde{x}_{t+\\Delta t}\nare sampled from the same conditional trajectory at time\nt\nt\nand\nt\n+\nΔ\n​\nt\nt+\\Delta t\n, which are easy to draw and require no knowledge of the marginal trajectory.\nIn essence, FABO minimizes an upper bound on the true acceleration penalty, serving as a tractable and effective proxy.

The results of the baseline methods are directly cited from EquiDiff\n(Wang et al.,\n2024\n)\n.\n4\nExperiments\n4.1\nImplementation Details\nWe evaluate EfficientFlow on 12 tasks from the MimicGen benchmark\n(Mandlekar et al.,\n2023\n)\n.\nThese tasks span a wide range of difficulties, time horizons, and object arrangements, providing a comprehensive testbed for assessing policy performance across diverse robotic manipulation scenarios.\nNotably, the agent view camera in MimicGen is not positioned orthogonally to the workspace but rather provides an agent-centric perspective. While the resulting image rotations may not perfectly align with the true object rotations, potentially impacting the performance of equivariant networks, this setup more closely mirrors real-world scenarios where state information is acquired from non-ideal viewpoints and thus offers a more rigorous test of policy generalization.\nOur work aims for effective and efficient robot control in embodied AI.\nThus, we compare EfficientFlow against strong baselines in this field, including EquiDiff\n(Wang et al.,\n2024\n)\n, ACT\n(Zhao et al.,\n2023\n)\n, and two variants of Diffusion Policy\n(Chi et al.,\n2023\n)\n: the CNN-based DP-C and the Transformer-based DP-T.\nFor fair comparison, all baseline methods use the same input as EfficientFlow: RGB images from both the agent-view and wrist-mounted cameras.\nIn addition to the RGB-based methods, we further compare with DP3\n(Ze et al.,\n2024\n)\n, which utilizes 3D point cloud information.\nAll policies employ absolute pose estimation for control.\nWe evaluate EfficientFlow with 1, 3, and 5 NFE, while for baseline methods, we adhere to their original configurations.\n4.2\nQuantitative Comparison\n4.2.1\nSampling Efficiency\nEfficientFlow demonstrates notable advantages in inference speed and sampling efficiency.\nAs shown in Table\n2\n,\nit achieves an average inference time of only 12.22 ms under a 1-NFE setting, offering an approximately 56.1\n×\n\\times\nspeedup over EquiDiff.\nEven with a more computationally demanding 5-NFE inference, EfficientFlow remains approximately 19.9\n×\n\\times\nfaster than EquiDiff on average.\nThis significant gain in efficiency is critical for real-time robotic control, where rapid response is essential, and enables inference frequencies of up to 81.8 Hz with single-step EfficientFlow.\n4.2.2\nData Efficiency\nAs shown in Table\n1\n,\nunder the data-limited setting of only 100 demonstrations,\nEfficientFlow not only enables significantly faster inference but also achieves a strong policy success rate.\nAcross the 12 test tasks, EfficientFlow outperforms EquiDiff in 7 of them.\nFor the remaining 5 tasks, except the Nut Assembly D0 task, the performance gap between EfficientFlow and EquiDiff is within 5 percentage points.\nThese results indicate that EfficientFlow can match or even surpass the performance of the SOTA baseline method while drastically reducing inference latency.\nWhen trained with 200 demonstrations, EfficientFlow achieves 98.4% of the success rate of the DP-C method trained with 1000 demonstrations, while surpassing the average success rates of DP-T, DP3, and ACT.\nThis remarkable performance underscores its exceptional data efficiency and strong generalization under limited supervision.\nMethod\nNFE\nRuntime (ms)\nAverage Success Rate (%)\n100\n200\n1000\nOurs\n1\n12.22\n52.61\n66.18\n75.25\n3\n22.59\n53.49\n69.33\n81.36\n5\n34.45\n54.18\n70.26\n81.99\nEquiDiff\n100\n685.92\n53.77\n68.59\n79.69\nDP-C\n100\n542.96\n42.00\n57.75\n71.42\nDP-T\n100\n497.53\n29.00\n43.00\n64.92\nDP3\n10\n53.83\n23.92\n35.08\n56.75\nACT\n1\n12.51\n21.33\n38.17\n63.25\nTable 2:\nAverage success rates and inference time of EfficientFlow and baselines across 12 MimicGen tasks.\nMethod\nSk\nSq\nTh\nS3\nCf\n3P\nHm\nMu\nKi\nPP\nNu\nCP\nAvg\nOurs\n20\n60\n20\n40\n30\n40\n10\n30\n30\n40\n40\n20\n31.7\nEquiDiff\n70\n80\n40\n50\n40\n70\n50\n40\n30\n60\n50\n40\n51.7\nNoAcc\n30\n40\n20\n60\n30\n60\n20\n10\n30\n50\n30\n40\n35.0\nTable 3:\nMinimum training epochs required for EfficientFlow and EquiDiff to reach 50 % of their final maximum success rate (MimicGen, 100 demonstrations, evaluated every 10 epochs with a fixed seed).\nMethod\nSk\nSq\nTh\nS3\nCf\n3P\nHm\nMu\nKi\nPP\nNu\nCP\nAvg\nOurs\n94\n21\n31\n48\n65\n11\n75\n50\n66\n37\n59\n75\n52.6\nNoAcc\n88\n16\n24\n44\n56\n10\n56\n28\n42\n16.5\n28\n62\n39.3\nNonEqui\n88\n12\n12\n14\n52\n0\n66\n38\n54\n17.5\n43\n56\n37.7\nEquiCFM\n88\n8\n22\n44\n60\n8\n54\n36\n66\n19\n40\n40\n40.4\nEquiMF\n96\n22\n26\n34\n50\n8\n58\n50\n62\n26\n51\n72\n46.3\nTable 4:\nAblation study on 12 MimicGen tasks using 100 demonstrations.\n4.2.3\nMore Analysis of the Performance\nAs shown in Table\n2\n, the average success rates across all tasks further highlight the advantage of EfficientFlow.\nFirst, the average performance of EfficientFlow exhibits an upward trend as the NFE increases; with sufficient data, multi-step inference can better capture the conditional action distribution to achieve higher success rates.\nMore importantly, across all dataset sizes, EfficientFlow consistently exceeds the average success rate of EquiDiff\n(Wang et al.,\n2024\n)\nwhile requiring dramatically fewer inference steps.\nWe attribute the advantage of EfficientFlow to two key design choices: the strong inductive biases introduced by the equivariant architecture, and the acceleration regularization that stabilizes the action sampling trajectories.\nThese factors enable the model to more efficiently learn key task structures and robust dynamics representations from limited demonstrations.\n4.2.4\nLearning Efficiency\nTo quantitatively evaluate the learning efficiency of EfficientFlow, we measure the minimum number of training epochs required to reach 50% of the final peak success rate.\nAs shown in Table\n3\n, both EfficientFlow and its variant without acceleration regularization (NoAcc) require substantially fewer training epochs than EquiDiff to reach 50% of their maximum success rate.\nNotably, in the Hammer Cleanup D1 task, EfficientFlow requires only one-fifth of the epochs needed by EquiDiff.\nThese results demonstrate the improved learning efficiency and stronger optimization dynamics of our equivariant flow-based framework.\nThe acceleration constraint further improves convergence speed, as evidenced by the faster learning of EfficientFlow compared to NoAcc.\nThese results indicate that EfficientFlow can extract essential policy information from demonstrations more rapidly, which reflects its superior learning dynamics,\nenabling it to reach target performance levels significantly faster than baseline methods.\n4.3\nAblation Study\nTo disentangle the contributions of the equivariant architecture and the acceleration regularization, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies across 12 MimicGen tasks using 100 demonstrations in Table\n4\n.\nWe evaluate four key variants:\n1) NoAcc, which removes the acceleration term and is trained solely with the Conditional Flow Matching loss (\nL\nCFM\nL_{\\text{CFM}}\nin Eq.\n3\n);\n2) NoEqui, which discards the equivariant architecture in favor of a non-equivariant backbone similar to Diffusion Policy\n(Chi et al.,\n2023\n)\nwhile retaining the acceleration constraint;\n3) EquiCFM, which combines the equivariant network with Consistency Flow Matching\n(Yang et al.,\n2024b\n)\n; and\n4) EquiMF, which integrates the equivariant network with MeanFlow\n(Geng et al.,\n2025\n)\n.\nThe results reveal two clear trends.\nFirst, both our proposed components, including equivariance and acceleration regularization, substantially and independently improve performance. Removing either one leads to a consistent drop in success rate, demonstrating their complementary roles: the equivariant structure provides strong inductive biases for learning symmetric behaviors, while the acceleration term stabilizes sampling trajectory learning.\nSecond, to further investigate the benefit of our acceleration regularization, we compare EfficientFlow against other efficient one-step flow matching variants.\nBy replacing our formulation with Consistency Flow Matching\n(Yang et al.,\n2024b\n)\nand MeanFlow\n(Geng et al.,\n2025\n)\nwhile keeping the equivariant architecture fixed, we observe that EfficientFlow achieves higher overall success rates across tasks. This suggests that our acceleration-regularized formulation not only stabilizes training but also leads to more accurate and robust policy generation.\n5\nConclusion\nWe introduce EfficientFlow, a theory-grounded generative policy learning framework that effectively balances inference speed and data efficiency. By leveraging equivariant flow matching and acceleration regularization, this work provides a principled approach for learning robust visuomotor policies while ensuring strong generalization and efficient learning.\nThe ultra-fast inference and strong data efficiency of EfficientFlow highlight its potential as a practical and high-performance solution for real-world embodied AI systems.\n6\nAcknowledgments\nThis research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (62302385).\nAppendix\nIn this appendix, we first present the proof of Theorem 1 of the main paper in Section\nA\n, followed by the proof of the Flow Acceleration Upper Bound in Section\nB\n.

Suppose the initial distribution\np\n0\np_{0}\nis isotropic, i.e.,\np\n0\n​\n(\ng\n​\nx\n)\n=\np\n0\n​\n(\nx\n)\np_{0}(gx)=p_{0}(x)\nfor all\ng\n∈\nG\ng\\in G\n, and the velocity network\nu\nθ\n​\n(\nt\n,\nx\n|\no\n)\nu_{\\theta}(t,x|o)\nis equivariant, i.e.,\nu\nθ\n​\n(\nt\n,\ng\n​\nx\n|\ng\n​\no\n)\n=\ng\n​\nu\nθ\n​\n(\nt\n,\nx\n|\no\n)\nu_{\\theta}(t,gx|go)=gu_{\\theta}(t,x|o)\nfor all\ng\n∈\nG\ng\\in G\n.\nThen the induced conditional distribution at time\nt\nt\n,\nX\nt\n|\nO\n=\no\nX_{t}|_{O=o}\n, given by the flow ODE\nd\n​\nx\nt\nd\n​\nt\n=\nu\nθ\n​\n(\nt\n,\nx\nt\n|\no\n)\n,\nx\n0\n∼\np\n0\n\\frac{dx_{t}}{dt}=u_{\\theta}(t,x_{t}|o),x_{0}\\sim p_{0}\n, satisfies\nX\nt\n|\nO\n=\ng\n​\no\n=\nd\ng\n​\n(\nX\nt\n|\nO\n=\no\n)\n,\nt\n∈\n[\n0\n,\n1\n]\n\\displaystyle X_{t}\\big|_{O=go}\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle d}}{{=}}g\\left(X_{t}\\big|_{O=o}\\right),\\quad t\\in[0,1]\n(10)\ni.e., the output distribution is equivariant under the group action.\nProof.\nLet\nΦ\nt\n​\n(\nx\n0\n|\no\n)\n\\Phi_{t}(x_{0}|o)\nbe the solution of the ODE at time\nt\nt\nwith the initial value\nx\n0\nx_{0}\n, conditioned on\no\no\n, so\nx\nt\n=\nΦ\nt\n​\n(\nx\n0\n|\no\n)\nx_{t}=\\Phi_{t}(x_{0}|o)\n. We first show\nΦ\nt\n\\Phi_{t}\nis equivariant.\nLet\nx\n^\nt\n=\ng\n​\nΦ\nt\n​\n(\nx\n0\n|\no\n)\n\\hat{x}_{t}=g\\Phi_{t}(x_{0}|o)\n. Its initial condition is\nx\n^\n0\n=\ng\n​\nΦ\n0\n​\n(\nx\n0\n|\no\n)\n=\ng\n​\nx\n0\n\\hat{x}_{0}=g\\Phi_{0}(x_{0}|o)=gx_{0}\n. Its dynamics are:\nd\nd\n​\nt\n​\nx\n^\nt\n=\ng\n​\nd\nd\n​\nt\n​\nΦ\nt\n​\n(\nx\n0\n|\no\n)\n=\ng\n​\nu\nθ\n​\n(\nt\n,\nΦ\nt\n|\no\n)\n=\nu\nθ\n​\n(\nt\n,\ng\n​\nΦ\nt\n|\ng\n​\no\n)\n=\nu\nθ\n​\n(\nt\n,\nx\n^\nt\n|\ng\n​\no\n)\n.\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\hat{x}_{t}=g\\frac{d}{dt}\\Phi_{t}(x_{0}|o)=gu_{\\theta}(t,\\Phi_{t}|o)=u_{\\theta}(t,g\\Phi_{t}|go)=u_{\\theta}(t,\\hat{x}_{t}|go).\n(11)\nSince\nx\n^\nt\n\\hat{x}_{t}\nand\nΦ\nt\n​\n(\ng\n​\nx\n0\n|\ng\n​\no\n)\n\\Phi_{t}(gx_{0}|go)\nshare the same initial condition and ODE dynamics, by uniqueness\n(Perko,\n2013\n)\n, we have\ng\n​\nΦ\nt\n​\n(\nx\n0\n|\no\n)\n=\nΦ\nt\n​\n(\ng\n​\nx\n0\n|\ng\n​\no\n)\ng\\Phi_{t}(x_{0}|o)=\\Phi_{t}(gx_{0}|go)\n.\nUsing this equivariance, we can establish the main result.\nBy definition and the equivariance property, we have the following identity for the random variables:\ng\n​\n(\nX\nt\n|\nO\n=\no\n)\n=\ng\n​\nΦ\nt\n​\n(\nX\n0\n|\no\n)\n=\nΦ\nt\n​\n(\ng\n​\nX\n0\n|\ng\n​\no\n)\ng(X_{t}|_{O=o})=g\\Phi_{t}(X_{0}|o)=\\Phi_{t}(gX_{0}|go)\n(12)\nThis first equality holds by definition of the flow, and the second is the random variable identity derived from the deterministic equivariance of the flow shown above.\nNow, since the initial distribution\np\n0\np_{0}\nis isotropic, i.e.,\nX\n0\n=\nd\ng\n​\nX\n0\nX_{0}\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle d}}{{=}}gX_{0}\n, applying the same deterministic function\nΦ\nt\n(\n⋅\n|\ng\no\n)\n\\Phi_{t}(\\cdot|go)\nto both sides preserves the distributional equality. Therefore,\nΦ\nt\n​\n(\ng\n​\nX\n0\n|\ng\n​\no\n)\n=\nd\nΦ\nt\n​\n(\nX\n0\n|\ng\n​\no\n)\n\\Phi_{t}(gX_{0}|go)\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle d}}{{=}}\\Phi_{t}(X_{0}|go)\n(13)\nCombining (\n12\n) and (\n13\n), we have a chain of equalities:\ng\n​\n(\nX\nt\n|\nO\n=\no\n)\n=\nΦ\nt\n​\n(\ng\n​\nX\n0\n|\ng\n​\no\n)\n=\nd\nΦ\nt\n​\n(\nX\n0\n|\ng\n​\no\n)\ng(X_{t}|_{O=o})=\\Phi_{t}(gX_{0}|go)\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle d}}{{=}}\\Phi_{t}(X_{0}|go)\n(14)\nBy definition, the random variable\nΦ\nt\n​\n(\nX\n0\n|\ng\n​\no\n)\n\\Phi_{t}(X_{0}|go)\nis the same as\nX\nt\n|\nO\n=\ng\n​\no\nX_{t}|_{O=go}\n. Thus, we can conclude:\ng\n​\n(\nX\nt\n|\nO\n=\no\n)\n=\nd\nX\nt\n|\nO\n=\ng\n​\no\ng(X_{t}|_{O=o})\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle d}}{{=}}X_{t}|_{O=go}\n(15)\nThis completes the proof.\n∎\nAppendix

As illustrated, these tasks vary significantly in complexity and the number of objects involved. For clarity in our analysis, these tasks can be broadly categorized as follows:\n1.\nBasic Tasks (Stack, Stack Three): This category comprises a set of box stacking tasks primarily designed to evaluate the fundamental precision of the robot’s motion control.\n2.\nContact-Rich Tasks (Square, Threading, Coffee, Three Piece Assembly, Hammer Cleanup, Mug Cleanup): This group includes tasks that necessitate behaviors with substantial physical contact, such as insertions or drawer articulations. These tasks assess the robot’s capability for fine-grained manipulation and its adaptability to uncertainties arising from physical interactions.ă\n3.\nLong-Horizon Tasks (Nut Assembly, Kitchen, Pick Place, Coffee Preparation): These tasks require the sequential execution of multiple distinct behaviors, thereby testing the stability of the robot’s long-duration movements and its comprehensive ability to perform error recovery when necessary.\nIn our experiments, both agent-view and eye-in-hand image observations were captured at a resolution of\n84\n×\n84\n84\\times 84\npixels with 3 color channels (RGB). Point cloud observations consisted of 1024 points, with each point represented by 6 features (XYZ coordinates and RGB color).\nFigure 3\n:\nEnvironment diagrams depicting the MimicGen\n(Mandlekar et al.,\n2023\n)\nsimulation experiments. The image sequences for each task, presented from left to right, illustrate the progression from the initial state to the final completion of the respective tasks.\nFigure 4\n:\nThe reset distributions for each task in MimicGen\n(Mandlekar et al.,\n2023\n)\nsimulation experiments.\nAppendix F\nImplementation Details\nF.1\nNetwork Architecture\nFor the network architecture, an equivariant ResNet-18 is employed to encode the agent-view images, yielding an output dimensionality of\n256\n×\n8\n256\\times 8\n. Concurrently, images from the hand camera are processed by a standard non-equivariant ResNet-18, resulting in a 256-dimensional feature vector. These visual features, in conjunction with proprioceptive robot state information, are subsequently fused and compressed via an equivariant layer, producing a combined embedding of\n256\n×\n8\n256\\times 8\ndimensions.\nFollowing this, a time step\nt\n∈\n[\n0\n,\n1\n]\nt\\in[0,1]\nis randomly initialized, along with an initial noise action sequence\nx\n0\nx_{0}\nsampled from a prior distribution. The intermediate action state\nx\nt\nx_{t}\nat time step\nt\nt\nis obtained through linear interpolation between\nx\n0\nx_{0}\nand the target action sequence\nx\n1\nx_{1}\n. This\nx\nt\nx_{t}\nis then encoded by an equivariant action encoder into a\n64\n×\n8\n64\\times 8\ndimensional action embedding.\nThe aforementioned embeddings serve as conditioning inputs for a 1D-UNet. This network, featuring hidden layer dimensions of\n[\n512\n,\n1024\n,\n2048\n]\n[512,1024,2048]\n, predicts a\n64\n×\n8\n64\\times 8\ndimensional vector. Finally, this vector is equivariantly decoded to generate the velocity prediction\nu\nθ\nu_{\\theta}\n. The terminal action trajectory is then computed using the Euler method.\nF.2\nTraining Details\nWe train our models with the AdamW\n(Loshchilov & Hutter,\n2019\n)\noptimizer with a learning rate of\n10\n−\n4\n10^{-4}\nand weight decay of\n10\n−\n6\n10^{-6}\n(the learning rate in Coffee Preparation D1, Pick Place D0, and Hammer Cleanup D1 tasks is 0.001). We use a cosine learning rate scheduler with 500 warm-up steps. We conducted training on two types of graphics cards, 4090 and A100. The batch size we used is 80. For different tasks in MimicGen, the training on 4090 requires 23 to 82 hours, respectively. During training, the model receives the two most recent historical observations at each step. A single model output consists of an action sequence spanning 16 time steps, of which the\n[\n1\n,\n8\n]\n[1,8]\nsteps are executed. The total number of training steps was kept consistent across experiments with varying numbers of demonstrations.\nFor each different number of demos (100, 200, 1000), we maintain roughly the same number of training steps by training for 50000/n epochs, where n is the number of demos. Evaluations are conducted every 1000/n epochs (50 evaluations in total).\nFor baselines\n(Wang et al.,\n2024\n; Chi et al.,\n2023\n; Ze et al.,\n2024\n)\n, we adopted the hyperparameter configurations reported in their original publication, except that we use the same action sequence\nlength (16 for training and 8 for evaluation) in DP3\n(Ze et al.,\n2024\n)\nas\n(Wang et al.,\n2024\n; Chi et al.,\n2023\n)\nand our method. For the ACT\n(Zhao et al.,\n2023\n)\n, we follow the hyperparameters provided in the prior work, except that we use a chunk size of 10, a KL weight of 10, a batch size of 64 with a learning rate of\n5\n×\n10\n−\n5\n5\\times 10^{-5}\n, and no temporal aggregation, following the tuning tips provided by the authors.\nF.3\nEvaluation Strategy\nDuring the evaluation phase, the model similarly processes the two most recent observations. To enhance temporal consistency, five independent initial noise action sequences are randomly sampled and processed in parallel by the network. These sequences undergo an iterative inference process for 1, 3, or 5 steps (NFE=1, 3, or 5), resulting in five distinct candidate action trajectories.\nTo ensure smooth action transitions, the Euclidean distance is computed between each newly generated candidate trajectory and the terminal segment of the previously predicted trajectory. Specifically, this involves comparing the last 7 steps of the previous trajectory with the initial 1-8 steps of the current candidate trajectory. The candidate trajectory exhibiting the smallest Euclidean distance is then selected for execution. Furthermore, to encourage exploration, approximately every 10 predictions, a trajectory is chosen randomly from the candidates instead of always selecting the one with the smoothest transition.\nAppendix G\nAdditional Analysis\nG.1\nHyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis for\nλ\n\\lambda\nThe FABO module is critical for the model’s performance. Given that its influence is modulated by the hyperparameter\nλ\n\\lambda\n, we performed a sensitivity analysis on the formulation of\nλ\n\\lambda\nfor the Mug Cleanup D1 task, which is particularly sensitive to this component. The formulation adopted in this work is\nλ\n=\n(\n1\n−\nt\n)\n2\n\\lambda=(1-t)^{2}\n. We tested several alternative formulations to validate this choice in Table\n6\n.\nThe result reveals two key insights. First, the time-varying characteristic is essential, as replacing it with a constant schedule degrades the success rate from 50% to 42.0%. Second, the model exhibits significant robustness to the scale of this formulation: multiplying the original schedule by factors of 0.5, 1, or 2 yields comparable results. This insensitivity suggests that precise calibration of the magnitude is unnecessary, effectively easing the hyperparameter tuning overhead.\nHyperparameter Setting for\nλ\n\\lambda\nMean Success Rate (%)\nTime-Varying Formulations\n0.5\n​\n(\n1\n−\nt\n)\n2\n0.5(1-t)^{2}\n48.0\n±\n1.6\n48.0\\pm 1.6\n(\n1\n−\nt\n)\n2\n(1-t)^{2}\n50.0\n±\n1.6\n50.0\\pm 1.6\n2\n​\n(\n1\n−\nt\n)\n2\n2(1-t)^{2}\n51.3\n±\n3.8\n51.3\\pm 3.8\nConstant Formulations\n0.5\n0.5\n42.0\n±\n2.8\n42.0\\pm 2.8\nTable 6\n:\nSensitivity analysis of the hyperparameter\nλ\n\\lambda\non the Mug Cleanup D1 task. The maximum task success rate among 50 evaluations throughout training and the standard deviations are reported.\nG.2\nAnalysis of Trajectory Quality\nTo quantify trajectory smoothness, we measured the rate of change in velocity at 500 sampled timesteps on the Stack D1 task. EfficientFlow exhibits a mean velocity change of 0.103 (std: 0.088), representing a significant reduction of 24.3% compared to the NoAcc baseline (mean: 0.136, std: 0.133).\nAppendix H\nMulti-Modal Extensions and Generalization\nH.1\nMulti-Modal Performance in MimicGen\nTo further investigate the adaptability and potential of our core architecture, we extend EfficientFlow to incorporate 3D geometric information through a voxel-based representation.\nWe implemented a voxel-based variant of EfficientFlow and compared it against our original RGB-based model from the main paper. For context, we also include results from a strong point-cloud-based method, Flowpolicy\n(Zhang et al.,\n2025\n)\n, and its baseline, DP3\n(Ze et al.,\n2024\n)\n. The evaluation was conducted in the MimicGen environment on five tasks (Stack D1, Threading D2, Square D2, Stack Three D1, and Three Pc. Asse. D2), with each model trained on 100 demonstrations. We report the mean of maximum success rates over three random seeds in Table\n7\n.\nThe Voxel-based EfficientFlow achieves superior performance by leveraging richer spatial perception and explicit 3D geometry. This demonstrates that our strategy effectively generalizes across different input modalities. However, the acquisition overhead of 3D data—ranging from sensor cost to real-time processing—poses a barrier to real-world deployment. Consequently, while Voxels offer peak performance, our RGB variant remains a vital solution for scenarios where simplicity and hardware accessibility are prioritized.\nMethod\nStack\nThreading\nSquare\nStack 3\n3Pc.

We trained EfficientFlow and Diffusion Policy\n(Chi et al.,\n2023\n)\nusing only 20 expert demonstrations for four proficient-human (ph) single-arm tasks. Other hyperparameters mirror those used in our MimicGen experiment.\nDue to the limited randomness in the initial state distributions of these tasks, the data efficiency gains stemming from equivariance are less pronounced compared to the MimicGen experiments.\nNevertheless, EfficientFlow consistently outperforms the baseline across the majority of tasks, securing a superior average success rate.\nMethod\nTool hang\nCan\nLift\nSquare\nAverage\nDP-C\n15.3\n±\n\\pm\n2.5\n67.3\n±\n\\pm\n5.0\n100.0\n±\n\\pm\n0.0\n42.7\n±\n\\pm\n4.7\n56.3\nOurs\n16.7\n±\n\\pm\n5.7\n90.7\n±\n\\pm\n0.9\n100.0\n±\n\\pm\n0.0\n44.0\n±\n\\pm\n5.9\n62.9\nTable 8\n:\nPerformance comparison on Robomimic tasks.

  "preview_text": "Generative modeling has recently shown remarkable promise for visuomotor policy learning, enabling flexible and expressive control across diverse embodied AI tasks. However, existing generative policies often struggle with data inefficiency, requiring large-scale demonstrations, and sampling inefficiency, incurring slow action generation during inference. We introduce EfficientFlow, a unified framework for efficient embodied AI with flow-based policy learning. To enhance data efficiency, we bring equivariance into flow matching. We theoretically prove that when using an isotropic Gaussian prior and an equivariant velocity prediction network, the resulting action distribution remains equivariant, leading to improved generalization and substantially reduced data demands. To accelerate sampling, we propose a novel acceleration regularization strategy. As direct computation of acceleration is intractable for marginal flow trajectories, we derive a novel surrogate loss that enables stable and scalable training using only conditional trajectories. Across a wide range of robotic manipulation benchmarks, the proposed algorithm achieves competitive or superior performance under limited data while offering dramatically faster inference. These results highlight EfficientFlow as a powerful and efficient paradigm for high-performance embodied AI.\n\n\\contribution\n[*]Equal Contribution\n\\contribution\n[†]Corresponding author\nEfficientFlow: Efficient Equivariant Flow Policy Learning for Embodied AI\nJianlei Chang\nRuofeng Mei\nWei Ke\nXiangyu Xu\nXi’an Jiaotong University\nAbstract\nGenerative modeling has recently shown remarkable promise for visuomotor policy learning, enabling flexible and expressive control across diverse embodied AI tasks.\nHowever, existing generative policies often struggle with\ndata inefficiency\n, requiring large-scale demonstrations, and\nsampling inefficiency\n, incurring slow action generation during inference.\nWe introduce EfficientFlow, a unified framework for effi",

      "answer": "## 论文核心分析：EfficientFlow\n\n这篇论文提出了一种名为 **EfficientFlow** 的新型策略学习框架，旨在解决当前基于生成模型的具身智能（Embodied AI）策略在**数据效率**和**采样效率**上的双重瓶颈。\n\n### 核心要解决的问题\n\n1.  **数据效率低 (Data Inefficiency)**：现有的生成式策略（如扩散模型）需要大量的专家演示数据才能训练出高性能的策略。\n2.  **采样效率低 (Sampling Inefficiency)**：推理时，这些模型通常需要数百步的迭代去噪过程来生成一个动作，导致延迟过高，无法满足实时机器人控制的需求。\n\n### 核心创新点与解决方案\n\nEfficientFlow 通过两个关键技术创新，巧妙地解决了上述问题：\n\n#### 1. 等变流匹配 (Equivariant Flow Matching) - 提升数据效率\n\n-   **目标**：增强模型的泛化能力，使其能从更少的数据中学习。\n-   **方法**：\n    -   将**等变性 (Equivariance)** 引入到**流匹配 (Flow Matching)** 框架中。等变性是一种强大的归纳偏置，它要求当输入（如场景图像）发生某种对称变换（例如平面旋转）时，输出的动作也应发生相应的、可预测的变换。\n    -   **理论保证**：论文的核心贡献之一是提供了严格的数学证明（Theorem 1）。该定理指出，只要使用各向同性的高斯先验分布（`p0`），并设计一个等变的速度场网络 `uθ`，那么由流匹配生成的最终动作分布 `X1|O=o` 必然保持等变性。\n-   **效果**：这使得策略能够自动“理解”环境的对称性。例如，无论物体在工作台上的朝向如何，模型都能生成正确的操作动作，从而极大地减少了学习不同朝向配置所需的数据量。\n\n#### 2. 加速度正则化与FABO损失 - 提升采样效率\n\n-   **目标**：加速推理过程，实现极快的动作生成。\n-   **挑战**：直接优化轨迹的平滑度（即最小化加速度 `d²x/dt²`）在标准流匹配中是不可行的，因为它需要知道难以获取的边际轨迹（marginal trajectories）。\n-   **方法**：\n    -   提出一种新颖的**加速度正则化**策略，鼓励生成更平滑、曲率更低的流轨迹，从而可以用更少的积分步数（NFE）准确生成动作。\n    -   为了解决计算难题，作者提出了一个精巧的**代理损失函数**——**流加速度上界 (Flow Acceleration Upper Bound, FABO)**。\n    -   **FABO的核心思想**：利用训练中容易获得的**条件轨迹 (conditional trajectories)** 来构建一个对真实加速度惩罚项的**上界估计**。具体来说，它计算的是在连续时间步 `t` 和 `t+Δt` 上，条件轨迹点 `~xt` 和 `~xt+Δt` 对应的速度差 `||u(t, ~xt) - u(t+Δt, ~xt+Δt)||²`。\n    -   **理论依据**：附录B中的定理2证明了，在小时间步长下，这个FABO值是真实加速度惩罚的一个上界。因此，最小化FABO可以有效地促使真实轨迹变得平滑。\n-   **效果**：通过FABO，模型可以在标准训练流程中稳定地学习到平滑的流场，从而在推理时仅需1-5步就能生成高质量动作，实现了数量级的加速。\n\n### 总结\n\n```markdown\n- **想解决的问题**：  \n  具身AI中生成式策略的 **数据效率低下** 和 **推理速度慢** 两大痛点。\n\n- **怎么解决的**：  \n  提出了 **EfficientFlow** 框架，结合了两种核心技术：\n  1.  **等变流匹配**：通过理论保证的等变性，大幅提升模型泛化能力，减少数据需求。\n  2.  **FABO加速度正则化**：通过一个可计算的上界损失，间接优化轨迹平滑度，实现超快速推理。\n\n- **实际价值**：  \n  在MimicGen基准测试中，EfficientFlow不仅在有限数据下性能优越，其推理速度更是比SOTA的EquiDiff快了 **19.9至56.1倍**，为将高性能生成式策略应用于实时机器人系统铺平了道路。\n```\n\n**总而言之，EfficientFlow 是一个理论扎实、工程巧妙的统一框架，它成功地将“数据高效”和“采样高效”这两个看似矛盾的目标融合在一起，是具身AI领域的一项重要进展。**",

      "answer": "## EfficientFlow 作者前作分析与对比\n\n根据论文内容，**EfficientFlow 的核心作者（如 Dian Wang、Robert Platt 等）在机器人学习领域，尤其是在等变性（Equivariance）和生成式策略学习方面，有一系列重要的前期工作**。这些工作为 EfficientFlow 奠定了坚实的基础。\n\n下表详细梳理了其关键前作，并重点分析了 **EfficientFlow 相比于这些前作的具体技术改动和主要改进**。\n\n```markdown\n| 论文 | 年份 | 核心贡献 | 主要局限 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Equivariant Transporter Network (Huang et al., 2022)** | 2022 | 提出了一种 SE(3) 等变的抓取网络，将等变性引入端到端的视觉操作学习，显著提升了数据效率。 | 专注于抓取任务，未扩展到更复杂的连续动作空间和通用策略学习。 |\n| **SO(2)-Equivariant Reinforcement Learning (Wang et al., 2022b)** | 2022 | 首次系统地研究了 SO(2) 平面旋转对称性在强化学习中的应用，证明了等变模型能更好地泛化到对称配置。 | 应用于简单的 RL 环境，未解决复杂模仿学习中高维动作生成的问题。 |\n| **EquiDiff (Wang et al., 2024)** | 2024 | **最直接的前作**。将等变性与扩散策略（Diffusion Policy）结合，在 SE(3) 动作空间实现了强大的数据效率。 | 使用 DDPM 架构，需要数百步去噪采样，导致**推理速度极慢**（~685ms），无法满足实时控制需求。 |\n```\n\n### EfficientFlow 与前作的核心区别与主要改善\n\nEfficientFlow 并非凭空而来，它是在上述一系列工作的基础上，针对最关键的瓶颈——**推理效率**——进行的一次重大架构革新。其核心区别和改善可以总结如下：\n\n#### 1. 相对于 EquiDiff (Wang et al., 2024)：从“慢而准”到“快而优”的范式转变\n\n这是最根本、最重要的区别。EfficientFlow 和 EquiDiff 共享了“利用等变性提升数据效率”这一核心思想，但在**生成模型的底层架构**上做出了颠覆性的改变。\n\n-   **前作 (EquiDiff) 的方法**：\n    -   **模型**：基于 **DDPM (Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models)**。\n    -   **过程**：通过一个包含数百个步骤的迭代去噪过程，将高斯噪声逐步转换为有效的机器人动作。\n    -   **结果**：虽然性能优越，但每次动作生成需要约 100 步，导致推理时间长达 **685.92 毫秒**，这对于实时机器人控制是不可接受的。\n\n-   **EfficientFlow 的改动与改善**：\n    -   **模型**：摒弃 DDPM，转而采用 **Flow Matching**。\n    -   **过程**：学习一个由 ODE 定义的**连续流场**，可以直接通过数值积分（仅需 1-5 步）将噪声映射到目标动作。\n    -   **结果**：推理速度得到**数量级的提升**。在 1-NFE 设置下，平均推理时间仅为 **12.22 毫秒**，相比 EquiDiff 实现了 **56.1 倍**的加速。这使得高达 81.8 Hz 的实时控制成为可能。\n\n> **结论**：EfficientFlow 继承了 EquiDiff 的“数据高效”基因，但通过更换生成模型骨架，彻底解决了其“推理低效”的致命弱点，实现了从“实验室优秀”到“工业可用”的跨越。\n\n#### 2. 相对于早期等变性工作 (如 Huang et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022b)：从专用模块到统一框架的演进\n\n早期的工作更多是探索等变性在特定任务或简单模型上的有效性。\n\n-   **前作的方法**：\n    -   将等变性应用于**特定的子任务**，如抓取检测或简单的状态价值函数估计。\n    -   模型相对简单，未能处理复杂的、多模态的连续动作序列生成问题。\n\n-   **EfficientFlow 的改动与改善**：\n    -   **统一框架**：构建了一个完整的、端到端的**等变流策略学习框架**，能够直接从视觉观测生成复杂的 6-DoF 末端执行器轨迹。\n    -   **理论保证**：提供了严谨的数学证明（Theorem 1），表明在各向同性先验和等变速度场条件下，整个流匹配过程能**保持输出分布的等变性**。这为框架的有效性提供了坚实的理论基础，超越了早期经验性的验证。\n    -   **表达能力**：能够捕捉并生成多模态的动作分布，适用于更广泛的复杂操作任务。\n\n> **结论**：EfficientFlow 不再是一个针对特定问题的工具，而是一个通用、强大且有理论支撑的**完整解决方案**，将等变性从一个“技巧”提升为一个“原则”。\n\n#### 3. 关键技术创新：加速度正则化 (Acceleration Regularization)\n\n为了进一步优化 Flow Matching 在极少步数（如 1-NFE）下的表现，EfficientFlow 引入了全新的训练目标。\n\n-   **问题**：标准的 Flow Matching 训练可能导致流轨迹过于弯曲，即使使用 Flow Matching，1-NFE 的性能也可能不理想。\n-   **EfficientFlow 的创新**：\n    -   **提出**：在训练目标中加入一个惩罚“加速度”（即轨迹二阶导数）的正则项，鼓励生成更平滑、更直的流轨迹。\n    -   **挑战**：直接计算真实流轨迹的加速度是不可行的。\n    -   **解决方案**：提出了 **FABO (Flow Acceleration Upper Bound)** 这一巧妙的代理损失。它利用**条件轨迹**（Conditional Trajectories）来近似并上界化真实的加速度，使得该正则项可以在标准训练流程中稳定、高效地计算。\n\n> **结论**：FABO 是一个极具实用价值的技术创新。它不仅解决了理论难题，还直接提升了模型在超高速推理模式下的性能和稳定性，是实现“1-NFE 高成功率”的关键技术保障。\n\n---\n\n### 总结\n\n| 对比维度 | 前作 (以 EquiDiff 为代表) | EfficientFlow | 改善/区别 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **核心架构** | 扩散模型 (DDPM) | 流匹配 (Flow Matching) | **推理速度提升 56.1 倍**，实现真正实时控制。 |\n| **数据效率** | 高 (得益于等变性) | **同等甚至更高** | 继承并巩固了等变性的优势。 |\n| **理论深度** | 经验性验证 | **提供等变性保持的严格证明** | 从工程实践上升到理论指导。 |\n| **训练创新** | 标准扩散/流匹配损失 | **引入 FABO 加速度正则化** | 显著提升少步数（1-NFE）下的性能和鲁棒性。 |\n| **实际价值** | 高性能但慢速 | **高性能且极速** | 成为首个兼具顶尖性能和实时推理能力的等变生成策略。 |\n\n总而言之，**EfficientFlow 的成功在于它精准地识别了前作（特别是 EquiDiff）的短板，并用一个更先进的生成模型（Flow Matching）替换了其“心脏”，同时辅以创新的训练技巧（FABO）来最大化新架构的优势**。这使其成为 embodied AI 领域一个里程碑式的高效解决方案。",

      "question": "论文的主要局限性有哪些？未来可能的改进方向是什么？",
      "answer": "## 论文的主要局限性与未来改进方向\n\n尽管 **EfficientFlow** 在数据效率和推理速度上取得了显著突破，但其设计和实验仍存在一些潜在的局限性。基于论文内容，可以总结出以下几点主要局限及相应的未来改进方向。\n\n---\n\n### 主要局限性\n\n- **对理想对称性的依赖**：\n  EfficientFlow 的核心优势——等变性（equivariance）——建立在任务环境具有明确几何对称性（如 SO(2) 平面旋转）的假设之上。然而，在复杂的现实世界中，许多任务的对称性可能不完整、不精确或根本不存在。例如，当物体形状不规则或场景布局不对称时，等变性带来的泛化增益会减弱。论文在 Robomimic 实验中的结果也间接证实了这一点：在初始状态随机性较低的任务中，等变性的数据效率优势并不明显。\n\n- **FABO 正则化的近似误差**：\n  加速正则化项 FABO 是一个精巧的代理损失，用于解决真实加速度无法计算的问题。然而，根据附录 B 和 C 的理论分析，FABO 实际上是真实加速惩罚的一个**上界**，并且其误差项与雅可比矩阵 $\\partial u / \\partial x$ 的方差相关。这意味着 FABO 并非完美地等价于最小化真实加速度，而是一种有偏的近似，其效果依赖于模型和数据的特性。\n\n- **输入模态的限制**：\n  论文主实验主要基于 RGB 图像输入。虽然附录 H.1 展示了 Voxel 版本的优越性能，但它也指出了 3D 数据获取的成本和复杂性问题。这表明，当前框架在处理多模态信息（如点云、深度图、语言指令）方面尚未完全探索，RGB 输入在感知复杂性和鲁棒性上存在天然瓶颈。\n\n- **硬件与部署的考量不足**：\n  尽管论文强调了“高效”和“实时控制”，但其实验仅在模拟环境中进行。从模拟到真实世界的迁移（Sim-to-Real）会面临传感器噪声、延迟、执行器误差等一系列挑战。论文未讨论模型在真实机器人上的部署细节、资源消耗（如内存占用、功耗）或对实时性的具体保障机制。\n\n---\n\n### 未来可能的改进方向\n\n- **自适应或学习型对称性**：\n  未来的方向可以是开发**自适应等变性**（Adaptive Equivariance）机制。与其预设固定的对称群 $G$，不如让模型从数据中自动发现或学习潜在的对称变换。例如，可以通过对比学习或不变性检测模块，动态识别哪些任务或场景部分具有可利用的对称性，并相应地激活等变结构。\n\n- **更精确的轨迹平滑策略**：\n  可以探索其他形式的高阶正则化或轨迹约束。例如，借鉴最优控制理论中的方法，直接在训练目标中引入对轨迹曲率（curvature）或抖动（jerk）的惩罚。或者，研究如何更紧密地逼近真实的边际流轨迹，从而减小 FABO 的上界松弛度。\n\n- **多模态与跨模态等变性**：\n  将等变性原则扩展到多模态融合。例如，设计能够同时在视觉空间（图像旋转）和动作空间（机械臂末端旋转）保持等变性的跨模态网络架构。这不仅能提升性能，还能增强模型在不同传感器配置下的鲁棒性和通用性。\n\n- **面向真实部署的优化**：\n  未来的工作应更深入地考虑实际部署需求。这包括：\n  - 模型压缩与量化，以适应边缘计算设备。\n  - 设计低延迟的推理管道，确保 NFE=1 时的预测能稳定满足实时控制循环的要求。\n  - 进行广泛的 Sim-to-Real 实验，验证模型在真实机器人上的有效性。\n\n- **探索更高效的生成范式**：\n  EfficientFlow 已经通过 FABO 显著提升了采样效率，但 Flow Matching 领域仍在快速发展。未来可以将等变性思想与更先进的单步生成方法（如 Consistency Models 或 Rectified Flow）结合，进一步追求“一步到位”的高质量动作生成，实现真正的即时决策。\n\n```markdown\n总而言之，EfficientFlow 提供了一个强大且高效的范式，但其成功高度依赖于对称性假设和特定的近似技巧。未来的突破点在于使其更具**普适性**（不依赖预设对称性）、**精确性**（减少近似误差）和**实用性**（易于真实部署），从而真正成为通用具身智能的基石。\n```",
