    "abstract": "近年来，人形机器人领域的研究兴趣与技术进步显著。尽管取得诸多成果，但由于其形态结构、动力学特性及控制策略的局限性，相较于四足或轮式机器人等其他形态，人形机器人更容易发生倾倒。其自身重量大、质心位置高、自由度多的特点，使得不受控制的倾倒可能对机器人本体及周围物体造成严重的硬件损伤。该领域现有研究多集中于基于控制的方法，这类方法往往难以适应多样化的倾倒场景，且可能引入不适宜的人类先验知识。另一方面，大规模深度强化学习与课程学习可用于引导人形智能体探索符合其自身特性与物理属性的倾倒保护策略。本研究通过精心设计的奖励函数与领域多样化课程，成功训练人形智能体探索倾倒保护行为，并发现通过形成\"三角形\"结构，其刚性材料机身可显著降低倾倒损伤。通过综合指标与实验验证，我们量化了该方法相较于其他策略的性能表现，可视化其倾倒行为，并成功将其迁移至真实世界平台。",

    "preview_text": "Humanoid robots have received significant research interests and advancements in recent years. Despite many successes, due to their morphology, dynamics and limitation of control policy, humanoid robots are prone to fall as compared to other embodiments like quadruped or wheeled robots. And its large weight, tall Center of Mass, high Degree-of-Freedom would cause serious hardware damages when falling uncontrolled, to both itself and surrounding objects. Existing researches in this field mostly focus on using control based methods that struggle to cater diverse falling scenarios and may introduce unsuitable human prior. On the other hand, large-scale Deep Reinforcement Learning and Curriculum Learning could be employed to incentivize humanoid agent discovering falling protection policy that fits its own nature and property. In this work, with carefully designed reward functions and domain diversification curriculum, we successfully train humanoid agent to explore falling protection behaviors and discover that by forming a `triangle' structure, the falling damages could be significantly reduced with its rigid-material body. With comprehensive metrics and experiments, we quantify its performance with comparison to other methods, visualize its falling behaviors and successfully transfer it to real world platform.",
