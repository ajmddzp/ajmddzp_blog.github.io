    "html_content": "Probing Prompt Design for Socially Compliant Robot Navigation with Vision Language Models\nLing Xiao\n1\nToshihiko Yamasaki\n2\n1\nHokkaido University, 9-9 Kita-14-jo Nishi, Kita-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060-0814, Japan\n2\nThe University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8656, Japan\nling@ist.hokudai.ac.jp,\nyamasaki@cvm.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp\nAbstract\nLanguage models are increasingly used for social robot navigation, yet existing benchmarks largely overlook principled prompt design for socially compliant behavior. This limitation is particularly relevant in practice, as many systems rely on small vision language models (VLMs) for efficiency. Compared to large language models, small VLMs exhibit weaker decision-making capabilities, making effective prompt design critical for accurate navigation.\nInspired by cognitive theories of human learning and motivation, we study prompt design along two dimensions: system guidance (action-focused, reasoning-oriented, and perception–reasoning prompts) and motivational framing, where models compete against humans, other AI systems, or their past selves.\nExperiments on two socially compliant navigation datasets reveal three key findings. First, for non-finetuned GPT-4o, competition against humans achieves the best performance, while competition against other AI systems performs worst. For finetuned models, competition against the model’s past self yields the strongest results, followed by competition against humans, with performance further influenced by coupling effects among prompt design, model choice, and dataset characteristics. Second, inappropriate system prompt design can significantly degrade performance, even compared to direct finetuning. Third, while direct finetuning substantially improves semantic-level metrics such as perception, prediction, and reasoning, it yields limited gains in action accuracy. In contrast, our system prompts produce a disproportionately larger improvement in action accuracy, indicating that the proposed prompt design primarily acts as a decision-level constraint rather than a representational enhancement.\nFigure 1:\nNon-finetuned GPT-4o performs best with reasoning-focused prompts and human-competition framing, while finetuned VLMs benefit most from perception–reasoning prompts combined with competition against the model’s past behavior.\n1\nIntroduction\nMobile robots are increasingly deployed in a wide range of real-world applications, including healthcare and eldercare assistance, delivery and logistics, as well as security and surveillance. Many of these applications require robots to operate in public spaces shared with pedestrians, where they must interact naturally with humans and navigate safely in dynamic, socially complex environments. In such settings, it is essential for robots to exhibit socially compliant behaviors in both interaction and navigation, ensuring not only physical safety but also efficiency, comfort, and user acceptance\nFrancis\net al.\n(\n2025\n); Payandeh\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\n. First, robots must accurately perceive their surroundings, understand and anticipate human intentions, and reason under uncertainty in dynamic and cluttered environments. Moreover, they must balance navigation efficiency with social norms, safety constraints, and human comfort. Addressing these challenges requires tightly integrated perception, prediction, and planning capabilities that can adapt robot behavior to diverse and evolving interaction scenarios.\nExisting approaches to socially compliant navigation can be broadly categorized into imitation learning (IL)-based methods\nCuan\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\n, reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods\nKathuria\net al.\n(\n2025\n)\n, and vision language model (VLM)-based approaches\nSong\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\n. Among these approaches, VLM-based methods have recently attracted increasing attention due to the strong contextual understanding and commonsense reasoning capabilities of modern language models, as well as their inherent explainability. For example, VLM-Social-Nav\nSong\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\nleverages GPT-4V to generate navigation instructions conditioned on visual observations. Kawabata et al.\nKawabata\net al.\n(\n2025\n)\npropose SocialNav-MoE, an efficient mixture-of-experts VLM for socially compliant navigation trained with reinforcement fine-tuning. Wang et al.\nWang\net al.\n(\n2025\n)\nintroduce MAction-SocialNav, which explicitly addresses action ambiguity by enabling the generation of multiple plausible actions within a single scenario. Kong et al.\nKong\net al.\n(\n2025\n)\npresent AutoSpatial, a model designed for efficient spatial reasoning in social robot navigation. Narasimhan et al.\nNarasimhan\net al.\n(\n2025\n)\npropose OLiVia-Nav, which incorporates both social and environmental context during robot trajectory planning and adapts to previously unseen social scenarios. Liu et al.\nLiu\net al.\n(\n2025\n)\npropose the MUSON dataset for this task and evaluate the performance of several small VLMs on it.\nDespite these advances, existing studies primarily focus on model architectures and training strategies, while prompt design remains largely underexplored. This limitation becomes particularly critical in efficiency-oriented deployments that rely on small VLMs\nWang\net al.\n(\n2025\n)\n. In such settings, well-designed prompts play a crucial role in stimulating the decision-making capability, thereby compensating for the limited capacity of smaller models.\nIn this paper, we address this gap by systematically investigating prompt design for socially compliant robot navigation (as shown in Fig.\n1\n). Inspired by theories of human cognitive learning, we study how different types of guidance, including action focused prompts, reasoning oriented prompts, and prompts that integrate perception and reasoning, as well as different motivational framing strategies (competing against humans, other AI models, or the model’s past self), influence navigation performance.\nWe conduct experiments on two benchmark datasets and show that prompt design plays a critical role in shaping model behavior. Our results demonstrate that well designed prompts can substantially improve decision quality and social compliance, particularly in resource constrained settings based on small VLMs. Overall, the main contributions of this work are summarized as follows:\n•\nWe conduct a systematic study of prompt design for socially compliant navigation, focusing on system guidance and motivational framing.\n•\nWe show that optimal prompt configurations differ across models: reasoning-oriented prompts with competition against humans perform best for non-finetuned GPT-4o, while perception–reasoning prompts combined with competition against the model’s past behavior are most effective for finetuned small VLMs, with performance influenced by coupling effects among prompts, models, and datasets.\n•\nWe identify a semantic–decision mismatch: finetuning mainly improves semantic-level metrics, whereas our proposed system prompts yield larger gains in action accuracy, indicating that prompt design primarily functions as a decision-level constraint.\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\nSocial Robot Navigation\nFor social robot navigation, safety is paramount\nLiang\net al.\n(\n2021\n)\n. Classical methods enforce collision constraints or fuse multi-sensor data (2-D LiDAR, depth cameras) for smooth avoidance\nLiang\net al.\n(\n2021\n)\n.\nSafety alone, however, is insufficient in human-populated spaces. Robots must also respect social norms (such as personal space, group dynamics, cultural conventions) to be perceived as acceptable and trustworthy. Traditional methods often ignore such social norms, treating pedestrians merely as dynamic obstacles.\nLearning-based approaches seek to encode both safety and social awareness. Demonstration-driven motion learning\nSun\net al.\n(\n2021\n)\nand Reinforcement Learning (RL) in simulators\nLiang\net al.\n(\n2021\n)\nshow promise but depend on large datasets or highly realistic human simulations, which rarely capture nuanced interactions, yielding policies with poor generalization.\nRecently, VLMs have opened new directions. Several VLMs are developed to generate high-level actions\nPayandeh\net al.\n(\n2024\n); Liu\net al.\n(\n2025\n); Wang\net al.\n(\n2025\n); Kawabata\net al.\n(\n2025\n)\n, evaluate trajectories\nNarasimhan\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\n, and predict directions\nSong\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\n. Datasets such as SCAND\nKarnan\net al.\n(\n2022\n)\n, MuSoHu\nNguyen\net al.\n(\n2023\n)\n, SNEI\nPayandeh\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\n, and MUSON\nLiu\net al.\n(\n2025\n)\nhave further advanced research in this domain.\n2.2\nLanguage Prompt Tuning\nLanguage prompt tuning aims to improve the practical applicability of large-scale pre-trained language models by reformulating downstream tasks into natural language instructions that align with the models’ pretraining objectives\nBrown\net al.\n(\n2020\n); Zhou\net al.\n(\n2022\n)\n. In this paradigm, task performance critically depends on how the task is expressed through a prompt template and a verbalizer, which together define the interface between the model and the target task.\nA variety of prompt-based learning strategies have been explored, including handcrafted prompts\nXiao and Yamasaki (\n2025\n); Schick and Schütze (\n2021\n)\n, prompt mining and paraphrasing\nJiang\net al.\n(\n2020\n)\n, gradient-based prompt search\nShin\net al.\n(\n2020\n)\n, and automatic prompt generation\nGao\net al.\n(\n2021\n)\n. While these approaches demonstrate the effectiveness of prompt-based learning, prior studies have shown that discrete prompts are often highly sensitive to wording and formatting, which can lead to unstable performance across different tasks and models\nZhao\net al.\n(\n2021\n); Liu\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\n.\nThis sensitivity is particularly problematic in decision-critical and embodied scenarios such as socially compliant navigation, where many existing methods rely on small VLMs to achieve higher efficiency. However, small VLMs typically exhibit weaker decision-making capabilities than large models, making their behavior more vulnerable to suboptimal prompt formulations. As a result, how to retain computational efficiency while improving decision accuracy remains an open challenge. In this paper, we address this challenge through principled system prompt design.\n3\nProposed Methods\n3.1\nProposed Prompts\nInspired by theories of human cognitive learning and behavioral motivation\nDiMenichi and Tricomi (\n2015\n)\n, which suggest that human decision making is strongly influenced by both instructional structure and competitive incentives, we investigate prompt design for socially compliant robot navigation along two coupled dimensions: system guidance and motivational framing. Our goal is to understand how different combinations of these two dimensions affect the decision-making behavior of small VLMs, particularly in efficiency-oriented navigation settings.\nSpecifically, we design a set of textual system prompts that vary in the type of guidance provided to the model. These include action-focused prompts that directly constrain the model’s output to navigation actions, reasoning-oriented prompts that encourage explicit deliberation before action selection, and prompts that integrate perception and reasoning to jointly model environmental understanding and decision making. In parallel, we introduce different motivational framing strategies, where the model is instructed to perform competitively against humans, other AI systems, or its own past behavior. By systematically combining different guidance types with distinct motivational signals, we construct a prompt catalog that enables controlled analysis of their individual and joint effects on navigation performance. This design allows us to examine not only which prompt configurations yield higher action accuracy, but also how prompt structure influences the alignment between perception, reasoning, and final action decisions. Detailed prompt formulations used in our experiments are summarized below.\nTextual System Prompt Catalog\nShared Base Prompt.\nYou are an intelligent assistant specializing in socially compliant robot navigation.

Fig.\n3\npresents representative samples from the datasets. Specifically, SNEI contains 325 egocentric images with five-turn conversational annotations provided by four independent annotators. In our experiments, 265 samples are used for training and 60 samples are reserved for testing. MUSON consists of 800 curated egocentric samples that explicitly model both dynamic and static constraints. The dataset is annotated using a five-step chain of thought pipeline with a human and VLM and human double-checking procedure. We use 640 samples for training and 160 samples for testing.\nBoth datasets cover diverse indoor and outdoor environments with varying crowd densities and two different robot platforms, which helps mitigate the risk of overfitting to narrow annotator bias.\nTable 1:\nPerformance in terms of Action Accuracy (AA).

Since GPT-4o currently represents one of the strongest general purpose VLMs, we adopt it as the evaluation model for this analysis.\nTo ensure a fair and consistent comparison across different prompt designs, we constrain the model action space to a fixed set of discrete navigation commands. This design choice enables direct and unambiguous evaluation of the generated actions while preserving the model internal reasoning process. Specifically, the allowable actions include “Move Forward”, “Forward Left”, “Forward Right”, “Stop”, “Turn Left”, and “Turn Right”. The results are summarized in Table\n1\n. The “No System Prompt” setting indicates that no prefixed instruction is provided and the model receives only the input image and the user query without additional guidance or task framing. This configuration evaluates the inherent ability of GPT-4o to perform socially compliant navigation in the absence of explicit prompting.\nOverall, for non-finetuned GPT-4o, competition against humans yields the best performance, whereas competition against other AI models results in the worst performance. However, performance is also influenced by the interaction among prompt design, the language model, and the dataset.\nInterestingly, across both datasets, a naive system prompt performs worse than the no–system-prompt baseline, indicating that the use of system prompts is not universally beneficial. This finding highlights that prompt engineering must be carefully designed, as inappropriate or weakly aligned prompts can degrade model performance rather than improve it.\nFinetuned Small VLMs.\nWe further evaluate finetuned small VLMs, with results summarized in Tables\n3\nand\n3\n. Across different language models, competition against the model’s past self consistently yields the best performance, followed by competition against humans, while competition against other AI systems remains the least effective. Nevertheless, performance is still influenced by residual coupling effects among datasets, model variants, and prompt designs. Notably, the proposed system prompts lead to substantially larger improvements in action accuracy than in the semantic quality of generated language responses. This suggests that the proposed prompts mainly constrains the final action selection process, improving the alignment between model reasoning and discrete action decisions, rather than broadly enhancing semantic expressiveness.\n5.2\nVisualizations.\nAs shown in Fig.\n5\n, we qualitatively compare perception, prediction, reasoning, and decision-making behaviors of a finetuned TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0 model under different prompt strategies on the SNEI dataset. Without a system prompt, the model often exhibits weakly grounded reasoning, leading to unsafe navigation actions and potential human collisions. In contrast, prompts that integrate perception and reasoning and encourage competition against the model’s past behavior yield more accurate scene understanding, more coherent human motion predictions, and safer decisions. Fig.\n5\nfurther visualizes the resulting action predictions under different prompt settings.\n6\nLimitations and Future Work\nFirst, while the datasets used in this study enable controlled evaluation, their limited size may not fully capture the diversity of real-world social navigation scenarios, such as snowy weather, nighttime conditions, or situations involving traffic signals. Future work will consider larger and more diverse datasets to better assess generalization.\nThen, we focus on text-based prompt design and do not explore adaptive or learned prompting mechanisms. Incorporating online prompt adaptation and reinforcement learning to respond to environmental feedback is an important direction for future research.\nFinally, our experiments assume a constrained, discrete action space, which simplifies comparison but limits realism. Extending our analysis to continuous control and more complex embodied environments remains future work.\n7\nConclusions\nIn this paper, we study prompt design for socially compliant navigation in efficiency-oriented settings based on small VLMs. Inspired by theories of human cognitive learning and behavioral motivation, we investigate system guidance and motivational framing as two key dimensions of prompt design.\nExperiments on the SNEI and MUSON datasets show that optimal prompt configurations differ across models. For zero-shot GPT-4o, reasoning-oriented prompts with competition against humans achieve the best performance, whereas for finetuned small VLMs, prompts that integrate perception and reasoning combined with competition against the model’s past behavior perform best. Nevertheless, action accuracy is also influenced by coupling effects among prompt design, model choice, and dataset characteristics, leading to occasional exceptions.\nWe further show that system prompts are not universally beneficial: poorly designed prompts can underperform a no–system-prompt baseline. Moreover, while finetuning primarily improves semantic-level understanding, our proposed prompts yield larger gains in action accuracy, indicating that prompt design mainly acts as a decision-level constraint.\nOverall, our results demonstrate that principled, motivation-aware prompt design can substantially improve decision accuracy and social compliance without increasing model size, offering practical guidance for deploying small VLMs in real-world robot navigation.\nAcknowledgments\nThis paper is financially supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 24K20787.\nReferences\nM.

    "preview_text": "Language models are increasingly used for social robot navigation, yet existing benchmarks largely overlook principled prompt design for socially compliant behavior. This limitation is particularly relevant in practice, as many systems rely on small vision language models (VLMs) for efficiency. Compared to large language models, small VLMs exhibit weaker decision-making capabilities, making effective prompt design critical for accurate navigation. Inspired by cognitive theories of human learning and motivation, we study prompt design along two dimensions: system guidance (action-focused, reasoning-oriented, and perception-reasoning prompts) and motivational framing, where models compete against humans, other AI systems, or their past selves. Experiments on two socially compliant navigation datasets reveal three key findings. First, for non-finetuned GPT-4o, competition against humans achieves the best performance, while competition against other AI systems performs worst. For finetuned models, competition against the model's past self yields the strongest results, followed by competition against humans, with performance further influenced by coupling effects among prompt design, model choice, and dataset characteristics. Second, inappropriate system prompt design can significantly degrade performance, even compared to direct finetuning. Third, while direct finetuning substantially improves semantic-level metrics such as perception, prediction, and reasoning, it yields limited gains in action accuracy. In contrast, our system prompts produce a disproportionately larger improvement in action accuracy, indicating that the proposed prompt design primarily acts as a decision-level constraint rather than a representational enhancement.\n\nProbing Prompt Design for Socially Compliant Robot Navigation with Vision Language Models\nLing Xiao\n1\nToshihiko Yamasaki\n2\n1\nHokkaido University, 9-9 Kita-14-jo Nishi, Kita-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060-0814, Japan\n2\nThe University of Tokyo, 7",

            "answer": "好的，作为一名专业的学术论文分析助手，我将仔细分析这篇题为《Probing Prompt Design for Socially Compliant Robot Navigation with Vision Language Models》的论文，并详细阐述其提出的关键技术方法。\n\n## 论文核心技术创新分析\n\n本文的核心创新点并非提出新的模型架构或训练算法，而是**系统性地研究并设计了一套用于提升小型视觉语言模型在社交合规导航任务中决策性能的提示工程方法**。其技术方法主要围绕“提示设计”展开，具体可分为两个维度和一个评估框架。\n\n### 关键技术方法详述\n\n以下表格详细说明了论文提出的关键技术方法、其设计原理、具体实现及相关的数学评估细节。\n\n| 方法维度 | 具体类别 | 技术细节与原理 | 具体参数/数学原理 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **1. 系统引导** | **动作聚焦型** | **设计原理**：指令直接约束模型输出为导航动作，减少开放式生成的不确定性，旨在简化任务、提高决策效率。适用于需要模型快速响应的场景。<br>**具体实现**：在基础系统提示后，直接要求模型输出如“Move Forward”等离散动作，不鼓励生成冗长的推理过程。 | **动作空间**：`{“Move Forward”, “Forward Left”, “Forward Right”, “Stop”, “Turn Left”, “Turn Right”}`。这是一个预定义的、离散的、有限的集合，便于评估。 |\n| | **推理导向型** | **设计原理**：受人类认知理论启发，鼓励模型在决策前进行显式推理（“思维链”）。这旨在激活模型的内在推理能力，通过将隐含的决策过程语言化，可能提高决策的逻辑性和合规性。<br>**具体实现**：在提示中加入“Explain your reasoning clearly”等指令，强制模型生成“因为...所以...”格式的文本，然后给出最终动作。 | **无特定数学参数**，但其效果通过**语义相似度指标**（如下文的BERT-F1, SBERT）来量化生成的推理文本与人类标注的推理文本在语义上的一致性。 |\n| | **感知-推理融合型** | **设计原理**：进一步整合感知（对环境状态的描述）和推理（对状态的理解与预测）。这旨在促进跨模态对齐，使语言模型能更好地基于视觉输入进行连贯的“观察-思考-决策”。<br>**具体实现**：提示要求模型“Explain your **perception and reasoning** clearly”，即先描述看到了什么（如行人位置、姿态），再解释这意味着什么，最后给出动作。 | 同上，其“感知”和“推理”部分的质量分别通过对应问题的语义相似度指标进行评估。 |\n| **2. 动机框架** | **对抗人类** | **设计原理**：借鉴行为动机理论中的社会比较理论。通过引入“与人类竞争”的框架，试图激发模型的“好胜心”或使其对齐人类的高性能标准，从而可能产生更优、更人性化的决策。<br>**具体实现**：在提示中加入“Perform competitively against **humans**.”。 | **无特定数学参数**。其有效性通过最终**动作准确率**的相对提升来验证。 |\n| | **对抗其他AI系统** | **设计原理**：引入与同类智能体的竞争。旨在模拟多智能体环境，可能促使模型产生区别于其他AI的、更具特色的策略，但论文发现此框架效果最差。<br>**具体实现**：在提示中加入“Perform competitively against **other AI systems**.”。 | 同上。 |\n| | **对抗过去自我** | **设计原理**：借鉴自我提升理论。鼓励模型超越其自身的历史表现，这为微调后的模型提供了一个动态的、自适应的优化目标，可能有助于持续改进和避免退化。<br>**具体实现**：在提示中加入“Perform competitively against **your past self**.”。 | 同上。对于微调模型，此框架被证明最有效。 |\n| **3. 组合实验与评估框架** | **提示组合策略** | **设计原理**：系统性地将3种系统引导（A, R, PR）与3种动机框架（1,2,3）进行组合，形成9种具体的提示变体（如A1, R3, PR2）。这允许研究者分离并分析不同设计维度的影响及其交互作用。<br>**具体实现**：构建了一个结构化的提示目录，如表1所示，确保实验的对照性。 | **实验变量**：9种提示变体 x 不同模型（GPT-4o, Phi-2, StableLM-2, TinyLlama）x 不同数据集（SNEI, MUSON）。 |\n| | **评估指标** | **设计原理**：为了区分“语义生成质量”和“最终决策质量”，论文采用了多粒度评估指标。这揭示了**语义-决策不匹配**的关键发现：微调主要提升语义理解，而提示工程主要提升决策精度。<br>**具体实现**： | **1. 语义对齐（词级）: BERT-F1** <br> 公式：`BERT-F1 = 2 * (BERT-P * BERT-R) / (BERT-P + BERT-R)` <br> 其中： <br> `BERT-P = (1/n) * Σ_i max_j cos(p_i, t_j)` （预测token对参考的覆盖精度） <br> `BERT-R = (1/m) * Σ_j max_i cos(t_j, p_i)` （参考token被预测覆盖的召回率） <br> `p_i, t_j` 分别为预测和参考文本的上下文词向量，`cos`为余弦相似度。<br><br>**2. 语义对齐（句级）: SBERT** <br> 公式：`SBERT = cos(y_s_pred, y_s_gt) = (y_s_pred · y_s_gt) / (||y_s_pred|| * ||y_s_gt||)` <br> `y_s_pred, y_s_gt` 为整个预测句和参考句的Sentence-BERT嵌入向量。<br><br>**3. 动作安全: 动作准确率** <br> 公式：`AA = (1/N) * Σ_c I(y_c_pred == y_c_gt)` <br> `I(·)` 为指示函数，`y_c_pred` 和 `y_c_gt` 为第c个样本的预测和真实动作标签，`N`为总样本数。这是一个硬匹配指标，直接衡量决策正确性。 |\n| **4. 模型与训练基础** | **VLM架构与训练** | **设计原理**：为评估提示在“效率导向的小型VLM”上的作用，论文选择了代表性的小型开源模型进行微调和测试，而非依赖巨型API模型。<br>**具体实现**：采用**TinyLLaVA**框架。 | **架构**：冻结的视觉编码器（**SigLIP**） + 可训练的多模态投影器 + 可训练的小型语言模型（**Phi-2-2.7B**, **Stablelm-2-1.6B**, **TinyLlama-1.1B**）。<br>**训练参数**：AdamW优化器，初始学习率 `2e-5`，余弦退火调度，warmup比例3%，无权重衰减。批量大小32（通过梯度累积实现），训练5个epoch，FP16精度，使用DeepSpeed ZeRO Stage-3和FlashAttention-2加速。 |\n\n### 总结：技术创新与实际价值\n\n1.  **技术创新**：\n    *   **系统性提示设计框架**：首次在社交机器人导航领域，将提示设计解耦为“系统引导”和“动机框架”两个可组合、可分析的维度，并进行了大规模对照实验。\n    *   **动机理论的应用**：创造性地将人类行为动机理论（社会比较、自我提升）转化为可操作的AI提示框架，为可解释和可引导的AI决策提供了新思路。\n    *   **揭示“语义-决策不匹配”**：通过精细的评估指标，实证发现了微调与提示工程对模型能力影响的不同侧重点，深化了对VLM决策机制的理解。\n\n2.  **实际价值**：\n    *   **低成本性能提升**：为资源受限（使用小型VLM）的机器人系统提供了一种**不增加模型计算开销、仅通过优化“软件提示”即可显著提升导航决策准确性和社会合规性**的实用方案。\n    *   **部署指南**：给出了明确的经验性结论：对于未微调的强大模型（如GPT-4o），使用**推理导向+对抗人类**的提示；对于已微调的小型模型，使用**感知-推理融合+对抗过去自我**的提示能获得最佳效果。\n    *   **警示作用**：明确指出不当的提示设计可能比不使用系统提示效果更差，强调了在关键应用中谨慎进行提示工程的重要性。",

            "answer": "## 论文实验数据集与评估指标分析\n\n### 一、实验数据集\n论文在两个公开的社交合规导航数据集上进行了实验：\n\n1. **SNEI 数据集** (Social Navigation through Egocentric Images)\n   - **样本规模**：共 325 个以自我为中心的图像样本。\n   - **标注方式**：每个样本包含由 4 名独立标注者提供的五轮对话式标注。\n   - **数据划分**：265 个样本用于训练，60 个样本用于测试。\n   - **特点**：覆盖多样化的室内外环境，包含不同的人群密度和两种不同的机器人平台，有助于减少标注者偏差带来的过拟合风险。\n\n2. **MUSON 数据集** (Multimodal Social Navigation in Urban Environments)\n   - **样本规模**：共 800 个精心策划的以自我为中心的样本。\n   - **标注方式**：采用五步思维链（Chain-of-Thought）流程进行标注，结合人类和 VLM 的协作，并经过人工双重检查。\n   - **数据划分**：640 个样本用于训练，160 个样本用于测试。\n   - **特点**：明确建模了动态和静态约束，旨在支持推理导向的社交导航任务。\n\n**数据集可视化示例**（见图3）展示了室内外场景、不同人群密度及机器人平台的多样性。\n\n### 二、主要评估指标\n论文采用了三类评估指标，分别从语义对齐和决策准确性两个层面进行衡量：\n\n1. **语义对齐（词元级）**：**BERT-F1**\n   - **定义**：基于 BERT 上下文词嵌入，计算生成文本与参考文本之间的语义相似度。\n   - **计算方式**：\n     - **BERT-P（精确率）**：衡量生成内容有多少被参考文本支持，惩罚无关或幻觉内容。\n     - **BERT-R（召回率）**：衡量生成内容覆盖参考文本关键信息的程度，惩罚遗漏。\n     - **BERT-F1** 是两者的调和平均数，提供平衡的评估。\n   - **作用**：评估模型在**感知（Q1）、预测（Q2）、推理（Q3）** 等语义层面的生成质量。\n\n2. **语义对齐（句子级）**：**SBERT**\n   - **定义**：使用 Sentence-BERT 计算生成句子与参考句子在嵌入空间中的余弦相似度。\n   - **公式**：`SBERT = cos(𝐲_s_pred, 𝐲_s_gt)`\n   - **作用**：从整体句子语义层面评估生成内容与真实值的接近程度。\n\n3. **动作安全性**：**动作准确率（Action Accuracy, AA）**\n   - **定义**：直接评估模型输出的机器人动作是否与真实动作标签匹配。\n   - **公式**：`AA = (1/N) * Σ 𝕀(y_c_pred = y_c_gt)`，其中 𝕀 是指示函数。\n   - **作用**：这是**最关键的决策级指标**，直接反映模型选择正确导航指令（如“前进”、“左转”、“停止”等）的能力。\n\n### 三、主要性能提升与关键发现\n论文的核心发现揭示了提示设计与模型类型、数据集之间的复杂耦合关系，其性能提升主要体现在**动作准确率（AA）** 上：\n\n1. **对于未微调的 GPT-4o（零样本设置）**：\n   - **最佳提示组合**：**推理导向提示（R系列）** + **与人类竞争（A1/R1/PR1）**。\n   - **性能表现**：在 SNEI 数据集上，AA 从无系统提示的 0.550 提升至 **0.633**（R1提示）；在 MUSON 数据集上，从 0.531 提升至 **0.563**。\n   - **关键发现**：与其它AI系统竞争的提示（A2/R2/PR2）表现最差。**不恰当的提示设计（如原始系统提示）甚至可能使性能低于无提示基线**。\n\n2. **对于微调后的小型 VLMs**（如 Phi-2, StableLM-2, TinyLlama）：\n   - **最佳提示组合**：**感知-推理集成提示（PR系列）** + **与过去自我竞争（A3/R3/PR3）**。\n   - **性能提升示例**（以 TinyLlama-1.1B 在 MUSON 数据集为例）：\n     - 无系统提示时，AA 为 0.375。\n     - 使用最佳提示（PR3）后，AA 提升至 **0.563**，相对提升显著。\n   - **关键发现**：\n     - **语义-决策不匹配**：微调主要大幅提升了语义级指标（BERT-F1, SBERT），但对动作准确率（AA）的提升有限。例如，微调后语义相似度得分可能很高，但选错动作的情况依然存在。\n     - **提示的核心作用**：论文提出的系统提示能带来**不成比例的巨大动作准确率提升**。这表明，精心设计的提示主要充当了**决策级约束**，引导模型将更好的内部语义理解转化为正确的最终动作，而非普遍增强其语义表示能力。\n\n**总结**：论文通过系统的提示设计，在资源受限的小型 VLM 上，实现了**决策准确性（AA）的显著提升**，尤其是在具有挑战性的拥挤或模糊场景中。这为在实际机器人部署中，不增加模型计算成本而通过“提示工程”提升社交合规导航性能提供了重要依据。",
