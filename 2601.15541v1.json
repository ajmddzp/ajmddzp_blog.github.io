The overall success rate across all tasks increases from 9.86% to 17.29%,\npresenting a promising path towards safe contact-rich manipulation using VLAs.\nWe release our code, prompts, and force-torque-impedance-scenario context datasets at\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/compliantvla\n.\nI\nIntroduction\nRecent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have enabled robots to understand and execute complex tasks described in natural language, such as\nRDT\n[\n18\n]\n, Pi0\n[\n6\n]\n, DiffusionVLA\n[\n26\n]\n, Pi0.5\n[\n9\n]\n, OpenVLA\n[\n13\n]\nand OpenVLA-oft\n[\n12\n]\n.\nThese models leverage large-scale pretraining on diverse datasets to learn rich visual and linguistic representations, allowing them to generalize across a wide range of manipulation tasks.\nCurrent state-of-the-art VLA models demonstrate remarkable generalization across diverse manipulation tasks. However, these models fundamentally operate through position or trajectory control, treating the robot as a rigid position-tracking system that lacks consideration of the physical interaction dynamics involved in contact-rich tasks\n[\n34\n,\n25\n]\n.\nWe observe the limitation of the current VLA models that hinder their performance in contact-rich tasks if considering the contact force threshold (e.g., <30N).\nThe contact force can become huge when the robot is executing raw output of VLA in contact-rich tasks without force regulation. Safety issue highlights the limitation of current VLA models\n[\n20\n]\n.\nFigure 1\n:\nExisting VLA systems lack force-awareness, leading to unsafe interactions in physical tasks involving contact or uncertainty. We see this challenge as a promising direction for safer deployment of VLA systems.\nThis rigid execution paradigm leads to critical failures when interacting physically.\nThey have a core limitation as illustrated in Fig.\n1\n: VLAs excel at semantic understanding but cannot translate this understanding into the physical compliance required for safe execution.\nConsider a robot assembling a delicate electronic device (“insert the USB cable”): it must insert a fragile connector with just enough force to engage the latch, yet gentle enough to avoid damage.\nOr imagine a robot closing a drawer, where excessive force could damage the drawer or its contents, while insufficient force might leave the drawer ajar.\nThe contact-rich manipulation tasks\nrequire not just visual understanding and action planning, but also precise force regulation and adaptive compliance.\nWhile recent VLA models have revolutionized robot learning through large-scale pretraining\n[\n22\n]\n, they critically lack the force-aware adaptation necessary for safe physical interaction.\n[\n33\n,\n31\n]\nalso points out the importance of torque-awareness in VLA models, but they only consider the torque prediction without force feedback and impedance control.\nThese shortcomings of the current VLA models lead\nto position commands even when encountering unexpected resistance, potentially causing irreversible damage to delicate objects or the robot itself. The disconnect between high-level semantic comprehension and low-level force-aware control represents a critical barrier to deploying VLA systems in real-world scenarios where safe physical interaction is paramount\n[\n11\n]\n. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an adaptor that preserves the generalization benefits of VLAs while incorporating the physical intelligence necessary for safe contact-rich manipulation.\nIn contrast, VIC provides compliant behavior in response to external forces through spring-damper dynamics,\noffers a complementary solution by modulating robot stiffness and damping to tackle interaction forces, enabling safe and adaptive physical interaction\n[\n1\n]\n.\nHowever, existing VIC approaches require manual tuning or task-specific parameter scheduling, lacking the semantic understanding to automatically adapt impedance based on visual context and task requirements.\nEven advanced learning-based VIC methods\n[\n21\n,\n32\n,\n28\n]\nrely on extensive task-specific training or expert demonstrations, limiting their generalization to novel objects and scenarios.\nRecent work has explored using VLMs to inform low-level control. For instance, SAS-prompt\n[\n2\n]\nuses VLMs to provide in-context guidance for robot policies, while other studies have employed VLMs to generate control parameters\n[\n23\n,\n10\n]\n.\nAdditionally, VLMs have demonstrated their capability as in-context value learners\n[\n19\n]\n, enhancing policy performance in various robotic tasks.\nInspired by these advances, we extend this paradigm by employing VLM as an in-context impedance coach within a classical VIC, where stiffness and damping parameters are dynamically regulated through multimodal reasoning based on visual, contact force and linguistic context inputs.\nWe present CompliantVLA-adaptor, a timely and effective but plug-and-play modular solution, before we train a high-performing VLA with sufficient and fine-grained datasets.\nThe CompliantVLA-adaptor augments VLA models with VLM-guided variable impedance control for safe contact-rich manipulation.\nOur experimental findings demonstrate that CompliantVLA-adaptor not only enhances task success rates but fundamentally transforms the nature of failure modes. While baseline VLA models exhibit catastrophic failures characterized by contact force threshold violations and toppled objects, our approach achieves graceful degradation, with failures primarily due to minor misalignments or slippage rather than unsafe forces.\nSpecifically, we present the following contributions:\n•\nThe proposed CompliantVLA-adaptor leverages a VLM-enhanced VIC to endow VLA models with compliant capability to physical interaction,\nwhere the VLM generates context-aware impedance parameters, translating high-level semantic understanding into low-level control parameters (stiffness, damping).\n•\nWe develop a control system that seamlessly integrates VLM parameters generation with VIC execution,\nmaintaining the generalization benefits of VLM’s reasoning while adding the safety improvement of compliant control.\n•\nWe demonstrate our approach on several contact-rich tasks across simulation and real hardware,\nshowing improvements over the state-of-the-art VLA baselines in both success rates and safety metrics.\nII\nRelated Work\nII-A\nVision-language-action models for robotic manipulation\nRecent advancements in VLA models have significantly enhanced robotic manipulation capabilities by enabling robots to interpret and execute complex tasks described in natural language.\nModels such as RDT\n[\n18\n]\n, Pi0\n[\n6\n]\n, DiffusionVLA\n[\n26\n]\n, Pi0.5\n[\n9\n]\n, OpenVLA\n[\n13\n]\n, and OpenVLA-oft\n[\n12\n]\nleverage large-scale pretraining on diverse datasets to learn rich visual and linguistic representations, allowing them to generalize across a wide range of manipulation tasks.\nThese models typically consist of a high-level policy that maps visual and linguistic inputs to desired action, which are then executed by a low-level controller.\nFor instance, OpenVLA employs an operational space controller (OSC) to apply the end-effector displacements generated by the VLA model.\nInstructVLA\n[\n30\n]\nfurther extends this paradigm by incorporating human feedback to refine action generation, but it still relies on a simple PD controller.\nWhile these VLA models excel at semantic understanding and high-level action planning, they often lack consideration of the physical interaction dynamics involved in contact-rich tasks.\nThis limitation can lead to unsafe or failed interactions when robots encounter unexpected resistance or delicate objects, as they are unable to adapt their compliance based on the interaction forces.\nII-B\nVariable impedance control for safe physical interaction\nVariable impedance control (VIC) enables robots to safely and adaptively perform contact-rich tasks by regulating compliance in response to interaction dynamics, inspired by human motor control\n[\n29\n]\n. Unlike fixed-gain controllers, VIC improves robustness and safety in uncertain environments\n[\n7\n]\nand is widely recognized as essential for physical interaction\n[\n1\n]\n.\nRecent work further shows that using variable impedance actions in reinforcement learning (RL) enhances sample efficiency, robustness, and generalization\n[\n21\n]\n, and supports safe exploration in contact-rich scenarios\n[\n32\n]\n. These studies establish VIC as a key paradigm for adaptable, safe, and efficient manipulation.\nLearning-based VIC has advanced through RL approaches that incorporate force/torque feedback for online stiffness modulation\n[\n21\n,\n32\n,\n3\n,\n8\n]\n, imitation learning approaches that extract impedance profiles from human demonstrations or inverse RL\n[\n28\n,\n27\n]\n, and context-aware methods leveraging human arm stiffness, trust models, or adaptive control\n[\n15\n,\n16\n]\n.\nDespite these successes, existing VIC methods remain limited: RL demands task-specific training and risky exploration, imitation learning depends on expert demonstrations and struggles to generalize, and context-aware schemes rely on hand-crafted features that cannot exploit rich semantic cues (e.g., visually identifying fragile electronics).\nCrucially, none of these can harness the broad semantic knowledge embedded in internet-scale vision-language models to inform impedance adaptation. This semantic gap forces conservative tuning or risks unsafe contact with novel objects. Our CompliantVLA framework closes this gap by bridging high-level semantic reasoning with low-level compliant control through VLM-guided variable impedance.\nII-C\nVLMs enhance impedance parameter generation for safe physical interaction\nVLMs offer unprecedented capabilities for robotics by understanding scene semantics and task requirements from visual inputs, context injection and crucial knowledge to determine appropriate physical interaction parameters.\nPrior VIC parameter generation methods fall into three categories:\n(1) Rely on expert knowledge to pre-define impedance schedules\n[\n35\n,\n14\n]\nfor specific tasks, limiting adaptability to novel scenarios.\n(2) Learning-based methods like ImpedanceGPT\n[\n4\n]\nuse language models for parameter selection but evaluate only on simplified pick-and-place tasks without complex contact dynamics.\n(3) Multimodal approaches incorporate additional sensors\n[\n10\n]\nsuch as eye tracking for teleimpedance control, while\n[\n5\n]\nadds tactile feedback—but require specialized hardware that limits deployment scalability.\nOur CompliantVLA-adaptor uniquely combines a VLM’s semantic understanding with real-time force feedback to generate context-aware impedance parameters.\nUnlike previous works that use VLMs only for high-level planning or require task-specific training,\nwe leverage pre-trained VLMs to directly map visual-linguistic context to impedance values, enabling zero-shot generalization across diverse contact-rich manipulation tasks while maintaining safety through force-regulated adaptation.\nIII\nMethodology\nWe present CompliantVLA-adaptor, augmenting VLA models with VLM-enhanced context-aware variable impedance control.\nOur approach consists of three key components: (1) a hybrid VLA-VIC control architecture, (2) VLM-based impedance parameter generation from visual-linguistic context, and (3) a real-time force-regulated safety layer. Fig.\n2\nillustrates the complete system architecture.\nFigure 2\n:\nOverview of the CompliantVLA-adaptor.

frozen VLM to extract multimodal features from external force, visual observations, and physics-injected language instructions, mapping them to context-aware impedance parameters.\nTo ensure safe

parameters.\nIII-B\n1\nContact Phase Recognition through multimodal information\nVision-only phase detection presents inherent limitations, as VLMs cannot reliably detect contact states from visual information alone, particularly in scenarios with occlusions or subtle contact transitions.\nWhile force sensors provide direct contact information, relying solely on force feedback neglects valuable semantic context about expected interaction patterns.\nTherefore, we implement a hybrid approach that combines VLM-based visual understanding with force sensor feedback for robust phase detection.\nWith the following prompt(simplified, see details in our code), the VLM can distinguish between\nFree-motion, Approaching, Contact, Retreat\n.\nThis semantic phase recognition eliminates the need for contact dynamics models while providing appropriate compliance for each interaction stage.\nSimplified Prompt for Contact Phase Recognition:\nYou are a robotics expert capable of

the VLM.\nConsidering the complex contact and motion scenarios,\nwe inject a physical-context prompt with our query prompts for impedance parameters\nso that the VLM can infer the appropriate anisotropic-centric impedance parameters.\nThe injected anisotropic-centric prompt is shown below:\nSimplified Prompt for context-aware impedance parameter generation:\nYou are an expert robotic

values (10--20%).\nThis context-awareness prevents both unnecessary conservatism and dangerous over-forcing in primary motion direction.\nNote that the impedance range should be appropriately scaled to match the hardware specifications.\nIII-C\nHybrid VLA-VIC control architecture\nOur control architecture seamlessly integrates VLA action generation with VIC execution enhanced by VLM,\nmaintaining the benefits of VLA generalization while adding compliant safety.\nThe system operates at three temporal scales:\n•\nVLM-informed impedance generation (\n∼\n\\sim\n1 Hz):\nThe VLM processes visual-linguistic context and force feedback to generate impedance parameters.\n•\nVLA action chunk (\n∼\n\\sim\n3 Hz):\nVLA generates desired end-effector displacements\n𝐱\nd\n\\mathbf{x}_{d}\nbased on current observations and instructions.\n•\nLow-level controller (1000 Hz):\nVIC controller tracks desired poses with adaptive compliance to maintain safe contact.\nIV\nExperiments\nWe evaluate CompliantVLA-adaptor on a suite of contact-rich manipulation tasks, such as object insertion and contact-sensitive pick-and-place.\nWe compare our approach against the SOTA VLA models, which rely on position control without force adaptation.\nIn these experiments, we aim to answer the following questions:\n(1) Does CompliantVLA-adaptor improve task success rates compared to baseline VLA models under force thresholds?\n(2) How effectively can the VLM generate context-aware impedance parameters for contact force regulation?\nIV-A\nSimulation tasks\nAll simulations are conducted in the same environment as the baselines to ensure fair comparison.\nTo show the effectiveness of our CompliantVLA-adaptor, we compare our approach against three VLA models: Pi0\n[\n6\n]\n, RDT-1B\n[\n18\n]\n, and OpenVLA-oft\n[\n12\n]\n.\nFocusing on contact-rich tasks, we selected 8 representative tasks from the LIBERO\n[\n17\n]\nand ManiSkill benchmarks\n[\n24\n]\n. All experiments were performed on 4 NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs.\nTask descriptions:\nTo comprehensively evaluate CompliantVLA-adaptor, we use eight representative contact-rich tasks from established benchmarks, instead of the full set of 100+ tasks, to avoid redundancy and resource constraints.\nTable\nI\nsummarizes the task descriptions, including precision insertion, shape sorting, drawer opening/closing, and object placement in constrained environments shown in Fig.\n3\n.\nThese tasks are chosen to evaluate the CompliantVLA-adaptor’s ability to handle complex contact dynamics that require both semantic understanding and safe physical interaction.\nBaseline models:\nTo diversely evaluate the effectiveness, we select three leading VLA models which are different architectures and training paradigms:\nPi0\n[\n6\n]\nuses flow matching for action generation;\nRDT-1B\n[\n18\n]\n, the largest diffusion-based foundation model for robotic manipulation;\nand\nOpenVLA-oft\n[\n12\n]\n, an Optimized Fine-Tuning (OFT) variant of OpenVLA.\nFigure 3\n:\nContact-rich tasks in simulation.\nTABLE I\n:\nList of tasks in simulation\nTask No.\nDescriptions\nTask 1\n(\nPeg Insertion\n) Pick up a orange-white peg and insert the\norange end into the box with a hole in it\nTask 2\n(\nPlug Charger\n) Pick up one of the misplaced shapes on the\nboard/kit and insert it into the correct empty slot\nTask 3\n(\nDrawer Env\n) pick up the black bowl in the top drawer of\nthe wooden cabinet and place it on the plate\nTask 4\n(\nOpen Drawer\n) open the middle drawer of the cabinet\nTask 5\n(\nOpen Drawer\n) open the top drawer and put the bowl inside\nTask 6\n(\nPush Plate\n) push the plate to the front of the stove\nTask 7\n(\nClose Drawer\n) put the black bowl in the bottom drawer of\nthe cabinet and close it\nTask 8\n(\nMicrowave Env\n) put the yellow and white mug in the\nmicrowave and close it\nExperiment protocol:\nWe adopt a two-stage evaluation protocol to isolate the contribution of CompliantVLA-adaptor under the same contact force safe constraint for each stage, see Sec.\nIV-B\n:\n(1), performance of baseline VLA model and (2) augmented operation with our VLM-enhanced VIC controller.\nStage 1 - Baseline VLA Performance:\nWe evaluate each baseline VLA model using its default control strategy.\nSince all three models employ position- or trajectory-based control without explicit force feedback, there is no compliance adaptation during contact.\nTherefore, we set a strict force threshold of 30N to ensure safety during execution. A task is terminated after three consecutive threshold violations or if not completed within the time limit (see Sec.\nIV-B\n).\nStage 2 - CompliantVLA-adaptor Integration:\nWe augment each baseline VLA model with the proposed CompliantVLA-adaptor,\nreplacing its low-level controllers with our VLM-enhanced VIC controller\nfor compliant execution. In the meantime, we keep the same force check criteria for fair comparison (see Sec.\nIV-B\n).\nIV-B\nContact force measurement and safety criteria\nContact forces are measured using a simulated wrist-mounted force/torque sensor. The sensor provides real-time feedback on interaction forces during task execution.\nSafety criteria are defined based on task requirements, with force thresholds set to prevent excessive contact that could damage objects or the robot. For all selected contact-sensitive tasks, the force threshold is set to 30N.\nDuring each task execution, we monitor force violations across all dimensions (\nF\nx\n,\nF\ny\n,\nF\nz\nF_{x},F_{y},F_{z}\n). The critical 30N threshold is based on typical safe interaction forces.\nIf the contact force exceeds this threshold three times consecutively (to filter out transient spikes due to sensor noise)\nduring a single trial, the task is immediately terminated and marked as failed to prevent potential damage.\nIV-C\nContact force regulation by CompliantVLA-adaptor\nWe further evaluate the effectiveness of our VLM-based impedance parameter generation for regulating contact forces in contact-rich manipulation tasks.\nAlthough force is continuously monitored during the whole task execution, impedance parameters are updated by querying the VLM every two action steps (\n≈\n{\\approx}\n0.5s), balancing responsiveness with computational load.\nWe also log the contact force profiles with suggested impedance parameters during task execution for further training datasets for the community.\nIV-D\nReal-world experiments\nOur experiment setup consists of a 7-DoF Franka Emika Panda robot arm with a Franka Panda parallel gripper. The same hardware is used in all real-world experiments to ensure consistency.\nThe robot operates in a workspace with diverse objects for contact-rich manipulation tasks (see Tab.\nII\n).\nTo facilitate efficient visual perception, real-time control and model inference, we designed and implemented a dual-machine system: the client (Ubuntu 22.04 with real-time kernel) handles data acquisition and low-level control, while the server (NVIDIA RTX A6000, 48GB VRAM) hosts the VLA model.\nFor the system architecture, considering the complexity of deploying ROS on the server side, we opted for the more lightweight and flexible WebSocket protocol for communication. The client collects proprioceptive states and camera images from the robot. This data is then packaged and sent to the remote server, where VLA model is deployed.\nUpon receiving the data, the server performs inference to generate actions. To ensure smooth and stable robot control, we apply an action interpolation algorithm to the returned action sequence, generating dense intermediate commands.\nFinally, these interpolated commands are sent to the low-level controller for execution.\nIV-D\n1\nVisual perception\nFor visual perception hardware, we employed a dual-camera configuration to capture comprehensive scene information. A Logitech USB camera serves as the main camera, providing a global view of the robot arm and the workspace.\nAn Intel RealSense D435i depth camera functions as the wrist camera, mounted on the end-effector of the Franka Emika Panda arm using an open-source, 3D-printed fixture,\noffering an ego-centric view. To meet the VLA’s input requirements, images from both cameras are uniformly resized to\n224\n×\n224\n224\\times 224\npixels before being fed into the model.\nV\nResults\nThrough comprehensive simulation and real-world experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CompliantVLA-adaptor that enhances the safety in contact-rich tasks compared to state-of-the-art VLA baselines,\nespecially in scenarios requiring fine force modulation and compliance adaptation.\nUnder the constraint of the contact-force threshold, the proposed approach achieves higher task success rates and reduces force violations, enabling safer and more effective manipulation in contact-rich environments.\nThe adaptive impedance parameters generated by the physical context-informed VLM enable the robot to adjust its interactions based on the task phase, thereby improving compliance and robustness in physical interactions.\nV-A\nSimulation results\nWe present quantitative results from our simulation tasks shown in Fig.\n4\n, comparing the performance of our CompliantVLA-adaptor with the SOTA VLA baselines.\nThe results show that our approach achieves significantly higher task success rates and reduces force violations across most of the contact-rich manipulation tasks (7/8).\nThe adaptive impedance parameters enable the robot to maintain safe interactions while effectively completing the tasks.\nFig.\n4\npresents a comprehensive comparison between the baseline VLA models and our CompliantVLA-adaptor approach.\nThe title of each bar diagram indicates different setups, where “T” with a value denotes task number (see its description in Tab.\nI\n),\nand the suffix “-R”, “-P” and “-O” means using RDT\n[\n18\n]\n, Pi0\n[\n6\n]\nand OpenVLA-oft\n[\n12\n]\nmodel, respectively.\nDifferent colors indicate the run with or without our CompliantVLA-adaptor.\nThe y-axis indicates the task success rates under the contact force threshold of 30N.\nThe results show that the baseline VLA models exhibit highly unstable performance across the task suite, even worse 0% in some tasks.\nOur CompliantVLA-adaptor improves performance across most tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness.\nNote that the baseline VLA models exhibit highly unstable performance across the task suite, with a maximum success rate of only 54% and some tasks always failed if considering contact force during execution.\nThis shows the different performance if considering the force threshold or not, compared to the original papers.\nAfter integrating the CompliantVLA-adaptor into these VLA models, most of the evaluated tasks showed consistent improvements while staying safe, with a maximum success rate of only 76% and significant improvement among tasks that always failed in baselines.\nThe average success rate across all tasks increases from 9.86% to 17.29%,\nthis aggregate improvement, while substantial, varies significantly across task categories.\nTasks involving mechanical constraints (drawers, stove knobs) show the most dramatic relative improvements, as these scenarios particularly benefit from the adaptive compliance provided by our VLM-guided impedance control.\nConversely, tasks with higher baseline performance, such as simple pick-and-place operations, show more modest but still meaningful improvements, primarily through enhanced force safety during object grasping and release phases.\nThese results validate our hypothesis that augmenting state-of-the-art VLA models with semantic-aware compliant control can bridge the gap between high-level task understanding and low-level force-safe execution.\nFigure 4\n:\nEvaluation results of task success rates under contact force constraint across 8 related tasks in simulation.\nTitle of each bar diagram indicates a different setup, where “T” with a value denotes task number, see its description in Tab.\nI\n,\nand the suffix “-R”, “-P” and “-O” means using RDT, Pi0 and OpenVLA-oft model, respectively.\ndifferent colors indicate the run with and without our CompliantVLA-adaptor.\nThe y-axis indicates the task success rates under the contact force threshold of 30N.\nThe results show that the baseline VLA models exhibit highly unstable performance across the task suite, even worse 0% in some tasks.\nOur CompliantVLA-adaptor improves performance across most tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness.\nIn terms of failure cases, baseline VLA models frequently encounter force violations leading to task termination, particularly in\n[\n18\n]\nplug charger task (Task2 in Tab.\nI\n)\nand both\n[\n6\n]\nand\n[\n12\n]\nin drawer manipulation tasks (Task3   5 in Tab.\nI\n) and\n[\n12\n]\nin push task(Task6 in Tab.\nI\n).\nIn contrast, our CompliantVLA-adaptor significantly reduces these violations by dynamically adjusting impedance parameters based on real-time force feedback and task context.\nThis adaptive behavior allows the robot to navigate contact-rich environments more safely and effectively, ultimately leading to higher task success rates.\nV-B\nReal-world experiment results\nWe test the method in a set of real-world tasks. See Table\nII\nfor the list of tasks and instructions.\nAs tested, the original output of VLA models (OpenVLA-oft and Pi0) is hard to work in the real world due to the reality gap and lack of zero-shot capability.\nThe robot often fails to reach the target object or the target position due to the model-mismatch challenge.\nNevertheless, we successfully completed the “\nkeep pushing the red box straight ahead\n” task which simplified the complexity by avoiding precise grasp but showcasing the physical contact scenario. See Fig.\n5\nfor the snapshots of the task execution and force/stiffness profiles during the task.\nTo achieve this behavior, we adopted a few strategies:\n1.\nWe only use the first two actions from the VLA models action chunk to avoid the compounding error.\n2.\nWe clip the output action of the VLA models into a smaller range to keep stable control.\nHowever, due to the drawbacks of the original VLA mentioned above, most of the tasks failed even though tested among different checkpoints of OpenVLA-oft and Pi0. See them in videos attached.\nWe reached the conclusion that fine-tuning is needed for the current VLA models when deployed to the real world in future work, especially for force-sensitive tasks and precise manipulation.\nAlthough real-world success was limited due to current VLA maturity, the adaptor consistently reduced unsafe forces, demonstrating its potential as a safety module.\nTABLE II\n:\nReal-world experiment evaluations\nReal-world exp.\nTask instructions\nreal task 1\nkeep pushing the red box straight ahead\nreal task 2\npick up the green bowl on the black table\nreal task 3\nclose the middle drawer\nreal task 4\npick up the black bowl and place it to red box\nreal task 4\npick up the tomato sauce and place it to red box\nreal task 5\npick up the moka pots and place it to red box\nreal task 6\npick up the book and place it in the drawer\nFigure 5\n:\nReal-world experiment evaluation: Stiffness regulation and measured force during the pushing task.\nVI\nDiscussion and Limitations\nWe discuss the limitations of our current approach and potential avenues for future work.\nWhile our CompliantVLA-adaptor demonstrates significant improvements in safe contact-rich manipulation, several limitations remain:\n1.\nVLMs cannot match the high-frequency low-level control time requirements. While current VLMs introduce latency, ongoing advances in lightweight onboard VLMs promise real-time feasibility.\n2.\nusing the API calls is expensive and not eco-friendly. On the other hand, using onboard VLM is computationally heavy.\n3.\nVLMs are not trained for robotics tasks, so they may not generate optimal impedance parameters for specific manipulation scenarios.\n4.\nVLMs may not generalize well to unseen objects or environments, leading to suboptimal performance in novel situations.\nVII\nConclusion\nIn this work, we propose a CompliantVLA-adaptor that leverages physical context-informed VLMs with VIC to enhance the performance of VLA in safe and effective manipulation in contact-rich tasks.\nBy leveraging the semantic grounding of VLMs and the physical robustness of VIC, we enable robots to adapt their impedance parameters based on task context derived from visual and language inputs.\nOur experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in both simulation and real-world experiments, achieving higher task success rates and reducing force violations.\nThis adaptor provides a lightweight, plug-and-play safety layer for existing VLA models, offering a practical step toward safe and generalizable contact-rich manipulation, bridging high-level semantic reasoning and low-level compliant control, enabling safer manipulation for VLA models in contact-rich environments.\nVIII\nAcknowledgments\nWe used ChatGPT (OpenAI, GPT-5) to aid literature searches and minor grammar/style edits.

            "question": "论文的主要局限性有哪些？未来可能的改进方向是什么？",
            "answer": "## 论文主要局限性分析\n\n基于对论文内容的分析，其提出的 **CompliantVLA-adaptor** 系统存在以下几个核心局限性：\n\n- **视觉语言模型（VLM）的实时性与计算成本**\n    - **延迟问题**：VLM 推理频率较低（约 1 Hz），无法满足高频（如 1000 Hz）底层控制对实时性的要求。这限制了系统在快速动态交互场景中的响应能力。\n    - **成本与能效**：依赖云端 API 调用（如 ChatGPT-4o-mini）成本高昂且不环保。若使用本地部署的 VLM，则计算负载沉重，难以在资源受限的机器人平台上部署。\n\n- **VLM 生成的阻抗参数并非最优**\n    - **领域知识缺失**：VLMs 并非为机器人任务专门训练，其生成的刚度（`K`）和阻尼（`D`）参数可能不是特定操作场景下的最优解，更多是基于语义推理的“合理”猜测。\n    - **泛化能力受限**：对于未见过的物体、环境或非常规的接触模式，VLM 可能无法准确推断出合适的阻抗参数，导致性能下降。\n\n- **基础 VLA 模型在现实世界中的成熟度不足**\n    - **现实差距（Reality Gap）**：实验表明，现有的 VLA 模型（如 OpenVLA-oft, Pi0）在仿真中表现尚可，但**零样本（zero-shot）** 迁移到真实世界时失败率很高，常因模型不匹配、动作累积误差等问题无法完成精确操作。\n    - **动作输出不稳定**：论文中提到，为在真实世界测试，不得不对 VLA 的原始输出进行大幅裁剪（如仅使用前两个动作、缩小动作范围），这暴露了当前 VLA 模型输出直接用于实际控制的脆弱性。\n\n- **系统集成与依赖**\n    - **多系统耦合**：架构依赖 VLA 生成动作、VLM 生成参数、VIC 执行控制，任何一环的故障或延迟都会影响整体性能。\n    - **传感器依赖**：需要腕部力/力矩传感器提供实时反馈。虽然这增强了安全性，但也增加了系统复杂性和硬件成本。\n\n## 未来可能的改进方向\n\n针对上述局限性，论文本身及后续研究可能朝以下方向发展：\n\n- **开发轻量化、机器人专属的 VLM**\n    - 训练或微调专为机器人物理交互推理设计的小型 VLM，降低计算开销，实现更高频率的在线参数生成。\n    - 探索**模型蒸馏**技术，将大型 VLM 的语义推理能力压缩到更高效的网络中。\n\n- **将阻抗参数学习与 VLA/VLM 进行端到端联合训练**\n    - 不将 VLM 作为冻结的“外挂”模块，而是将阻抗参数生成作为 VLA 模型训练的一部分，让模型直接学习输出**动作-阻抗联合指令**。\n    - 构建包含力/力矩与阻抗标签的大规模数据集，用于微调 VLA 或 VLM，使其具备更准确的物理交互直觉。\n\n- **增强基础 VLA 模型的现实世界鲁棒性**\n    - 对 VLA 模型进行**真实世界数据微调**，缩小仿真与现实之间的差距。\n    - 开发更强大的**动作序列平滑与纠错模块**，减少 VLA 输出动作的抖动和累积误差，提升其在真实控制中的直接可用性。\n\n- **探索更高效的多模态信息融合与决策架构**\n    - 研究如何更紧密、更低延迟地融合视觉、语言、力觉信息，可能采用**分层或注意力机制**，让不同频率的模块协同更高效。\n    - 考虑将部分决策（如紧急避障、过力保护）下放到更快速、确定的传统控制层，VLM/VLA 专注于高层策略和参数规划。\n\n- **拓展应用场景与评估基准**\n    - 在更复杂、动态的接触任务中测试系统，如非刚性物体操作、人机协作等。\n    - 建立更全面的安全性与性能评估指标，不仅关注成功率，也关注交互的平滑度、能耗等。\n\n**总结**：本文的创新点在于巧妙地利用现成的 VLM 为 VLA 模型增加了“物理常识”和安全性，但其局限性也源于这种“组装”范式。未来的根本方向是推动 **VLA 模型本身的内生性物理智能**，以及发展**高效、专有的机器人多模态推理模型**，最终实现语义理解与柔顺控制的无缝统一。",
