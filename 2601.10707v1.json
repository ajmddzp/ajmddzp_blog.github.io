We hypothesize that due to the self-attention mechanism, each patch feature implicitly embeds/contains information from all other patches, represented in a different way and intensity, making these descriptors highly redundant.\nWe quantify redundancy in such (BLIP2) features via PCA and cross-patch similarity:\n90\n%\n90\\%\nof variance is captured by\n17\n/\n64\n17/64\nprincipal components, and strong inter-token correlations are pervasive. Training on such overlapping information leads the policy to overfit spurious correlations, hurting OOD robustness.\nWe present Stochastic-Patch-Selection (SPS), a simple yet effective approach for learning policies that are more robust, generalizable, and efficient.\nFor every frame, SPS randomly masks a fraction of patch descriptors, not feeding them to the policy model, while preserving the spatial layout of the remaining patches.\nThus, the policy is provided with different stochastic but complete views of the (same) scene: every random subset of patches acts like a different, yet still sensible, coherent projection of the world. The policy thus bases its decisions on features that are invariant to which specific tokens survive.\nExtensive experiments confirm that across all OOD scenarios, our method outperforms the state of the art (SOTA), achieving a\n6.2\n%\n6.2\\%\naverage improvement and up to\n20.4\n%\n20.4\\%\nin closed‑loop simulations, while being\n2.4\n×\n2.4\\times\nfaster.\nWe conduct ablations over masking rates and patch–feature reorganization, training and evaluating 9 systems, with 8 of them surpassing prior SOTA.\nFinally, we show that the same learned policy transfers to a physical, real-world car without any tuning.\nFigure 1\n:\nStochastic Patch Selection (SPS) in a nutshell.\n(1) We use large vision-language models to extract patch-level features for input images. (2) These descriptors are often highly redundant and correlated. (3) SPS randomly masks a subset of descriptors, forcing the policy to learn based on different subsets and less correlation, improving efficiency (\n2.4\n×\n\\mathbf{2.4\\times}\nspeedup), generalization (\n+\n6.2\n%\n\\mathbf{+6.2\\%}\nperformance), and enabling plug-and-play integration with downstream policies. In (4), we compare speed vs performance on different variants of SPS against SOTA.\n1\nIntroduction and background\nAs autonomous‑driving technology matures, end‑to‑end approaches emerged as a leading strategy\n[\n1\n,\n2\n]\nembodying a transformative design philosophy: a single model handles everything, from perception to control. This approach (i) dispenses with many of the rigid assumptions imposed on individual submodules, and (ii) evaluates and optimizes performance against a single overarching objective, yielding a more coherent and effective system.\nFrom foundation models to driving polices.\nRecently,\nWang et al.\n[\n3\n]\nshowed that extracting patch‑aligned (multimodal) features from a foundation model (FM)\n[\n4\n,\n5\n,\n6\n]\n, for each input frame, and training a lightweight policy on those features, markedly improves out‑of‑distribution (OOD) generalization.\nTo obtain patch features, they applied\nmasked\nattention at a chosen layer (specifically, at the input to BLIP2’s Q-Former), so the mask guides the attention to focus on a single image patch. Repeating this operation for every patch yields a descriptor per patch.\nSince the descriptors come from the output layer that interfaces with the text encoder, they live in a shared vision–language space, enabling text-driven augmentation and robust policy debugging.\nPatch-wise features are redundant.\nWe posit that patch descriptors extracted from ViT backbones are intrinsically redundant and correlated.\nBefore introducing the masked‑attention layer, every patch embedding produced by the sub-ViT backbone has already attended to all other patches, as self‑attention mixes information across tokens; each “patch feature” is no longer a purely local descriptor, as it carries a weighted summary of the entire scene, although the information is focused on this patch.\nThis redundancy is detrimental when we hand the descriptors to the policy head: (1) Correlated inputs inflate the effective dimensionality of the feature space, making it harder for the policy network to disentangle the truly discriminative signals. (2) Overlapping information encourages over‑fitting; the policy may memorize spurious correlations present in the duplicated context instead of learning robust, spatially grounded cues. Finally, (3) unnecessary redundancy wastes computation and memory, both during training and at inference time.\n1.1\nOur contributions.\nWe first empirically show that patch-features are redundant in Section\n4.1\nvia similarity overlays, patch-wise correlations, and PCA explained-variance curves. Building on these insights, we propose\nStochastic-Patch-Selection (SPS)\n, a lightweight, plug-and-play patch-masking strategy that improves both the efficiency and OOD generalization of policy learning; See Figure\n1\n. Our main contributions are as follows.\n(i)\nSPS:\nAt each frame, SPS randomly drops a fixed proportion of patch descriptors, forwards the untouched descriptors to the policy network, and crucially leaves their grid positions unchanged. Each unmasked subset forms a coherent yet distinct stochastic view of the scene, encouraging the policy to focus on stable/invariant, causally relevant cues instead of spurious correlations.\n(ii)\nRobustness and efficiency gains over SOTA.\nAcross all OOD scenarios, SPS improves closed‑loop driving success by an average of\n6.2\n%\n6.2\\,\\%\n, and up to\n20.4\n%\n20.4\\,\\%\n, while being\n2.4\n×\n2.4\\times\n.\n(iii)\nComprehensive ablations at scale.\nWe train and evaluate 9 autonomous‑driving systems under varied masking ratios and patch‑reorganization schemes, identifying the design choices that maximize robustness; all variants except one surpassed the previous SOTA.\n(iv)\nSim‑to‑Real generalization.\nWe deployed SPS on a full-scale autonomous vehicle, showing a seamless transfer from simulation to a real car without tuning.\nNotably, as SPS operates in a shared vision‑language space, it inherits from\n[\n3\n]\nthe support for text‑conditioned perturbations/augmentation in the patches embedding space, yielding an additional\n1.7\n%\n1.7\\,\\%\nperformance boost.\n2\nRelated work\nEnd-to-end autonomous driving.\nEarly work established that neural networks can map raw sensory inputs directly to low-level control\n[\n1\n,\n2\n]\n, with subsequent efforts exploring probabilistic objectives and uncertainty-aware control\n[\n7\n]\n, stability/attention regularization\n[\n8\n]\n, and safety-aware formulations using control barrier functions\n[\n9\n,\n10\n]\n.\nWhile promising, end-to-end approaches typically demand large, diverse real-world datasets that are costly and risky to collect at scale\n[\n11\n,\n12\n]\n.\nTo mitigate this, photorealistic simulators like CARLA, AirSim, and Drake\n[\n13\n,\n14\n,\n15\n]\n, and trace-driven interactive simulation such as\nVISTA\n[\n12\n]\n, have become standard for training and evaluation. A complementary line replaces raw pixels with intermediate visual abstractions (affordances, semantics, lane topology) to simplify control\n[\n16\n,\n17\n,\n18\n]\n. In this space, “Drive Anywhere”\n[\n3\n]\nintroduced a\nfoundation-model\n-based pipeline that extracts rich, multimodal patch-aligned descriptors and feeds them to a lightweight policy head, showing strong OOD generalization. Our work builds on this FM-based formulation and aims to patch features\nreduce redundancy\nat train/inference time to improve OOD robustness without modifying or fine-tuning the FM.\nFoundation models in robotics and vision.\nLarge pretrained vision language models are increasingly used as general-purpose perception and reasoning backbones, from language-conditioned manipulation and planning\n[\n19\n,\n20\n,\n21\n,\n22\n,\n23\n]\n, video summarizations\n[\n24\n]\n, and 3D/open-world scene understanding\n[\n25\n,\n26\n,\n27\n]\nto navigation and instruction following\n[\n28\n]\nand follow-and-detect pipelines\n[\n29\n,\n30\n,\n31\n,\n32\n,\n33\n]\n.\nTheir cross-modal capacity also enables generative interfaces that tie vision and language\n[\n34\n,\n35\n,\n36\n,\n37\n]\n.\nWithin autonomous driving, some prior work cautions that the temporal reasoning robustness of off-the-shelf VLMs is limited in settings that require strong temporal understanding\n[\n38\n]\n; therefore, deploying them for driving tasks out of the box is not straightforward. This motivates learning downstream driving policies on top of features extracted from pretrained VLMs, rather than relying on end-to-end VLM reasoning. works increasingly leverage language-grounded or explainable representations/features/descriptors for introspection, learning, and counterfactual analysis\n[\n39\n,\n40\n,\n41\n,\n42\n,\n43\n,\n28\n,\n3\n]\n. We follow this trend in spirit, but use only frozen FMs (BLIP/BLIP-2\n[\n5\n,\n4\n]\n, DINO\n[\n44\n,\n45\n]\n) and intervene solely at the patch-descriptor interface to a small policy head—isolating our stochastic selection from FM training dynamics.\nPositioning and novelty.\nPrior end-to-end policies\n[\n1\n,\n2\n,\n7\n,\n8\n,\n9\n,\n10\n]\nand FM-based driving frameworks\n[\n3\n,\n28\n]\nhave not treated\nfeature redundancy\nin FM patch descriptors as a first-class lever for OOD robustness. Such patch embeddings from pretrained models can be obtained by: (i)\nregion-first\npipelines that segment the image (e.g., SAM/Mask2Former) and then pool features within each mask by an FM encoder (e.g., CLIP)\n[\n46\n,\n47\n,\n48\n,\n49\n,\n50\n,\n51\n]\n. These methods inherit sensitivity to segmentation quality and add extra compute stages. (ii)\npatch-aligned\nextraction directly from the backbone without external masks or fine-tuning\n[\n52\n,\n3\n,\n28\n]\n, preserving spatial layout at token resolution and avoiding segmentation dependencies.\nOur contribution is orthogonal and complementary: we show that even strong patch-aligned descriptors,\nare highly redundant\n. We therefore introduce\nStochastic Patch Selection (SPS)\n, a simple mechanism to handle such correlations, via a\npost-FM\ntoken-selection step that preserves spatial layout, reduces token count, and improves closed-loop OOD performance while reducing latency.\nSPS is architecture-agnostic, requires no FM fine-tuning. Evidence from PCA and inter-token-correlation analyses, ablations over masking/reorganization variants, and real-world transfer leads to a simple takeaway: for FM-derived patch features in driving,\nless can be more\n: carefully injected stochastic sparsity improves generalization without any overhead.\n3\nMethod\nWe first provide the preliminaries.\n3.1\nPreliminaries\nEnd-to-end driving as feature-based control.\nWe model an autonomous-driving policy as a control function\nϕ\n\\phi\nthat maps a perception stream\nF\n∈\nℝ\nH\n×\nW\n×\n3\nF\\!\\in\\!\\mathbb{R}^{H\\times W\\times 3}\nof RGB frames to steering and throttle commands\nu\n=\nϕ\n​\n(\nF\n)\nu=\\phi(F)\n.

From left to Right. 1st: Input images are processed through a frozen foundation model to produce patch-level descriptors. 2nd: In\nDrive-Anywhere\n, the full tensor is forwarded unchanged to the policy. 3rd: In our approach, we introduce two patch selection strategies (uniform stochastic and matrix-based probability selection), followed by (4th) a restructuring phase: either masking unselected descriptors or removing them and adjusting positional encodings.

The resulting redundancy\n(i) inflates the computation needed to extract\nevery\npatch feature,\n(ii) encourages the policy to rely on spurious,\ncorrelated cues that collapse under distribution shift, and\n(iii)  forces the policy to require every tiny detail of the full scene to provide a robust decision.\nOur goal is therefore to\nexpose the policy\n, at every input frame, to a fraction of the patch descriptors and withhold the others, via a token-level stochastic selection mechanism operating in the latent space of the foundation model, while maintaining the spatial layout of the remaining patches. Each random subset forms a different, yet still coherent, projection of the same scene, giving the policy a stream of stochastic but complete views. Consequently, the controller is trained to base its decisions on features that remain invariant to which specific tokens survive, yielding improved OOD robustness and lower compute, all while preserving spatial coherence and encouraging the use of robust, generalizable signals over exact token identity.\nLet\nN\n=\nH\n′\n​\nW\n′\nN=H^{\\prime}W^{\\prime}\ndenote the number of patch positions produced by the\nbackbone\nDesc\n(see Sec.\n3.1\n).\nFix a\nsampling rate\nrate\n∈\n(\n0\n,\n1\n]\n\\textsc{rate}\\in(0,1]\n.\nFor every input frame\nt\nt\nwe:\n1.\nSample a subset.\nUniformly at random, select exactly\nk\n=\n⌈\nrate\n⋅\nN\n⌉\nk=\\lceil\\textsc{rate}\\cdot N\\rceil\npatch indices,\ndenoted\nΩ\nt\n⊆\n{\n1\n,\n…\n,\nN\n}\n\\Omega_{t}\\subseteq\\{1,\\dots,N\\}\nwith\n|\nΩ\nt\n|\n=\nk\n|\\Omega_{t}|=k\n.\n2.\nCompute descriptors.\nRun the masked–attention extractor\n(Sec.\n3.1\n)\nonly\nfor patches\ni\n∈\nΩ\nt\ni\\in\\Omega_{t}\n,\nobtaining for every\ni\ni\n, the descriptor\nF\ni\n′\n∈\nℝ\nD\nF^{\\prime}_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D}\n.\n3.\nBuild the sparse tensor.\nAssemble\nF\n~\n′\n∈\nℝ\nH\n′\n×\nW\n′\n×\nD\n\\tilde{F}^{\\prime}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{H^{\\prime}\\times W^{\\prime}\\times D}\n:\nF\n~\ni\n′\n=\n{\nF\ni\n′\n,\ni\n∈\nΩ\nt\n,\n𝟎\n,\notherwise\n,\n\\tilde{F}^{\\prime}_{i}=\\begin{cases}F^{\\prime}_{i},&i\\in\\Omega_{t},\\\\\n\\mathbf{0},&\\text{otherwise},\\end{cases}\n(4)\nthereby\npreserving the original spatial layout\nso the policy head receives a tensor\nof fixed size.\nComputational footprint.\nThe expected fraction of evaluated descriptors is\nrate\n, so feature extraction time scales linearly with the keep-rate.\nFor example,\nrate\n=\n0.4\n\\textsc{rate}=0.4\ncuts the forward pass of the foundation model ViT\nL\n{}_{\\text{L}}\nbackbone by\n∼\n2.5\n×\n\\sim\\!2.5\\times\nwithout\naltering the policy architecture.

Strong off-diagonal correlation indicates widespread cross-patch redundancy. (c) Cosine-similarity overlays projected onto the image plane. Bright regions indicate patches whose descriptors are highly similar to the seed, visualizing global entanglement from self-attention.\nWe begin by empirically confirming that patch-wise features are redundant and highly correlated.\n4.1\nRedundancy analysis: qualitative and quantitative evidence\nPCA explained variance over feature dimensions.\nLet\nF\n∈\nℝ\nN\n×\nd\nF\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N\\times d}\nbe the descriptor matrix. We visualize the cumulative explained variance\nE\n​\n(\nm\n)\nE(m)\n(as in (\n3\n)) as a function of the number of components used\nm\nm\n. Fig.\n3\n(a) shows that\n90\n%\n90\\%\nof the variance is captured by\n17\n17\nof\n64\n64\nprincipal components.

The experiment was conducted on\n10000\n10000\nframes from different scenes, and averaged across all.\nPatch-wise correlation structure.\nWe compute the Pearson correlation between all patch descriptors within a frame to obtain an\nN\n×\nN\nN\\times N\ncorrelation matrix. A representative heatmap appears in Fig.\n3\n(b), which shows extensive off-diagonal positive and negative correlation, indicating pervasive redundancy across spatial tokens.\nSimilarity overlays on the image plane exampe.\nFor a seed patch\ni\ni\nwith descriptor\nf\ni\n∈\nℝ\nd\nf_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d}\n, we compute cosine similarities\ns\nj\n=\nf\ni\n⋅\nf\nj\n∥\nf\ni\n∥\n​\n∥\nf\nj\n∥\ns_{j}=\\frac{f_{i}\\cdot f_{j}}{\\lVert f_{i}\\rVert\\lVert f_{j}\\rVert}\nfor all patches\nj\nj\n, reshape\ns\n∈\nℝ\nN\ns\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N}\nto the\nH\n′\n×\nW\n′\nH^{\\prime}\\times W^{\\prime}\ngrid, upsample to the input resolution, and overlay it on the raw image with a heatmap. High intensity indicates semantic overlap. Examples for two seed locations are shown in Fig.\n3\n(c). Widespread high similarity far from the seed in multiple locations illustrates global entanglement and redundancy. See Appx.\nA.2\nfor the full\n16\n×\n16\n16\\times 16\ngrid of overlays for all patches.\nThese qualitative and quantitative results support our hypothesis that patch descriptors live in a low-dimensional subspace and exhibit strong cross-patch redundancy, explaining why stochastic sub-sampling maintains scene semantics.\nFigure 4\n:\nLeft: Diverse OOD sample frames across varying seasons, weather, and lighting conditions. Right: Real-car deployment representative frames from the rural road (public park) and parking garage, captured from both the onboard camera and external view.\n4.2\nSPS Experimental settings\nWe conduct extensive closed-loop driving experiments both for in-distribution and OOD environments. Below, we detail the hardware, tasks, evaluation metrics, and training data.\nTask definition and evaluation protocol.\nAs in\n[\n3\n]\n, we target a general-purpose autonomous driving task requiring the vehicle to follow lanes and avoid obstacles. Failure is defined by three conditions: (i) crossing lane boundaries, (ii) collisions or dangerously close proximity to objects, and (iii) heading deviations exceeding 30\n∘\nfrom the lane direction. In simulation, we assess performance using a normalized success duration metric, measuring how long the vehicle drives without triggering any failure, averaged over 100 episodes of roughly 20 seconds each. In real-world testing, performance is quantified by counting safety driver interventions, following the same failure definitions. Evaluations are performed in a closed-loop manner unless otherwise specified.\nTraining data and learning framework.\nOur training data combines real-world driving logs with diverse simulated experiences generated using VISTA\n[\n12\n]\n, a simulator built upon approximately two hours of real driving data captured across varied environments, lighting, and weather conditions. The learning procedure adopts Guided Policy Learning\n[\n53\n,\n12\n]\n, leveraging privileged simulator signals to supervise image-based control policies. Control labels are derived using a PID controller for lane keeping and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs)\n[\n9\n]\nfor safety-aware obstacle avoidance.\nPolicies are trained using the Adam optimizer (learning rate\n10\n−\n3\n10^{-3}\n), an L2 loss objective, and a plateau scheduler with patience 10 and no decay.\nWe utilize BLIP-2\n[\n4\n]\nas the feature extractor to enable a fare comparison with SOTA\n[\n3\n]\n.\nVehicle platform and Hardware.\nThe real car experiments were conducted using a fully autonomous 2019 Lexus RX 450H equipped with high-performance computing and sensing hardware. The onboard system includes an NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti GPU and an AMD Ryzen 7 3800X 8-core CPU. Visual input is captured via a BFS-PGE-23S3C-CS camera running at 30 frames per second, with a 130\n∘\nhorizontal field of view and a resolution of 960×600 pixels.\nThe models were trained and evaluated on a university-managed cloud cluster using a total of four A100 GPUs (40GB each). Training took approximately four days.\n4.3\nOOD generalization\nTable 1\n:\nBenchmarking OOD generalization.\n†\nIndicates car types different from training.\nID\n= in-distribution.\nOOD\n= out-of-distribution.\nSetting\nScenarios\nMethods\nUni-modal FMF\nMulti-modal FMF\nScene\nSeason\nWeather\nTime\nActor\nNo-FM\nI-ViT\nMF\nDA\nSPS (Ours)\nID\nRural\nSummer\nDry\nDay\nCar\n1.00\n1.00\n0.72\n1.00\n1.00\nOOD\nRural\nSpring\nDry\nDay\nCar\n†\n0.84\n0.86\n0.42\n0.96\n0.98\nSummer\nDry\nNight\nCar\n†\n0.30\n0.80\n0.35\n0.89\n0.92\nFall\nDry\nDay\nCar\n†\n0.90\n0.95\n0.74\n0.91\n0.96\nWinter\nSnow\nDay\nCar\n†\n0.14\n0.88\n0.42\n0.96\n0.99\nSpring\nDry\nDay\nAnimal\n0.85\n0.89\n0.39\n0.95\n0.99\nSummer\nDry\nNight\nAnimal\n0.29\n0.59\n0.39\n0.85\n0.86\nFall\nDry\nDay\nAnimal\n0.87\n0.95\n0.71\n0.88\n0.93\nWinter\nSnow\nDay\nAnimal\n0.15\n0.87\n0.45\n0.95\n0.99\nUrban\nSummer\nDry\nDay\nCar\n†\n0.55\n0.77\n0.50\n0.62\n0.82\nSummer\nRain\nDay\nCar\n†\n0.69\n0.81\n0.43\n0.81\n0.83\nSummer\nDry\nNight\nCar\n†\n0.45\n0.81\n0.42\n0.78\n0.87\nSummer\nDry\nDay\nAnimal\n0.58\n0.80\n0.50\n0.64\n0.79\nSummer\nRain\nDay\nAnimal\n0.66\n0.83\n0.43\n0.78\n0.84\nSummer\nDry\nNight\nAnimal\n0.45\n0.86\n0.36\n0.81\n0.88\nAverage\n0.55\n0.83\n0.47\n0.84\n0.90\nOur increase (%)\nvs. other methods\n↑\n𝟑𝟓\n%\n\\uparrow 35\\%\n↑\n𝟕\n%\n\\uparrow 7\\%\n↑\n𝟓𝟑\n%\n\\uparrow 53\\%\n↑\n𝟔\n%\n\\uparrow 6\\%\n–\nTo contextualize our improvements, we adapt the OOD generalization experiments and benchmarks reported in the\nDrive-Anywhere\n[\n3\n]\nframework.\nSpecifically, we train the model in rural environments during summer, under dry weather conditions and daytime lighting, with the presence of other vehicles on the road. We then evaluate its performance across diverse scenes, weather conditions, times of day, and in the presence of other dynamic actors.\nBaselines:\n(i) No Foundation Model (\nNo-FM\n)\n[\n8\n]\n,\n[\n12\n]\n, a baseline that trains a convolutional model without using foundation models (transformer-based variants performed similarly); (ii)\nMask-based Features (MF)\n[\n29\n,\n47\n]\n, which segment the input image by applying a universal segmentation model\n[\n46\n]\n, extracts a global feature vector for each region by applying a pretrained encoder\n[\n49\n]\non a crop bounding this region, and assign that vector uniformly to all pixels within the mask. (iii)\nInherent ViT Features (I-ViT)\n[\n52\n]\n, which extract per-patch features from the output of intermediate layers of a ViT model\n[\n6\n]\n, using the key, query, and value matrices as token-aligned visual descriptors, (iv) the current SOTA Drive Anywhere (DA)\n[\n3\n]\n, which creates per-patch descriptor via the masking strategy explained in Section\n3.1\n, and ours;\nSPS\nas defined in Section\n3.3\nwithout adding any variant from\n3.4\n, with a\nrate\n= 0.5.\nDiscussion.\nThe results are reported in Table\n1\n. First,\nMF\nunderperforms across both in-distribution and OOD settings, likely due to the applied masking model, which may miss and not segment part of the image\n[\n54\n]\n, and thus exclude relevant information from the feature tensor. In contrast,\nI-ViT\nand\nDA\noutperform\nNo-FM\n, underscoring the benefit of pretrained representations. However,\nI-ViT\nremains a uni-modal approach and does not incorporate language grounding. Finally, our proposed method,\nSPS\n, clearly outperforms all baselines, improving upon the previous SOTA (\nDA\n) by an average of 6% and up to 20% in specific OOD scenarios. Our improvement over each method is reported in the last row of the table. We provide examples in Fig.\n4\nfor representative frames from diverse OOD conditions.\nOther variants.\nWe evaluate additional variants of\nSPS\nyielding nine different models in total, incorporating different architectural modifications (e.g., different\nrate\n, position-adjusted, threshold masking). Figure\n5\nshows that 8 out of the 9 models outperform the strongest baseline in OOD settings, and Table\n2\nshows detailed results of all variants across each OOD scenario, demonstrating the robustness and flexibility of our approach; see Section\n4.5\nfor details.\nCross-backbone generalization (DINO).\nWe also applied SPS to a DINO backbone to test transfer beyond BLIP2. For brevity, we report in the appendix OOD scenarios that vary a lot from the in-distribution training set and are therefore especially challenging.

The augmentation pipeline proceeds as follows: (i) We prompt an LLM to produce a concise list of driving-relevant textual features; visual concepts present in the training scenes, e.g.,\nTree\nor\nTruck\n; these are then identified, and will plausibly be replaced to foster OOD generalization.\n(ii) An LLM is queried to generate alternative concepts that are visually plausible and commonly encountered in driving scenarios (e.g., house instead of tree).\n(iii) In selected frames, patch-level descriptors associated with the target concepts are replaced in latent space with those derived from the suggested alternatives using the foundation model’s text encoder. This results in a form of data augmentation that preserves scene coherence while introducing semantic diversity.\nTable 3\n:\nLanguage-guided augmentation for OOD generalization.\nWe fine-tune the pretrained\nSPS-50%\nmodel using language-driven latent feature substitution based on LLM-suggested concepts.\nRSDDC\nRSDNC\nRFDDC\nRWSDC\nRSDDA\n–\n+0.29%\n+1.85%\n–\n–\nRSDNA\nRFDDA\nRWSDA\nUSDDC\nUSRDC\n-0.21%\n+2.93\n–\n-1.16\n+4.39%\nUSDNC\nUSDDA\nUSRDA\nUSDNA\nAll\n+0.36%\n+3.86%\n+3.28%\n+1.43%\n+1.7%\nWe apply this technique as a lightweight fine-tuning step to the pretrained\nSPS-50%\nmodel. The model is updated for a small number of iterations using augmented latent features.\nAs shown in Table\n3\n, this results in a further +1.7% accuracy gain across OOD scenarios, excluding cases where the base model already achieves near-perfect performance (\n≥\n\\geq\n98%), where meaningful further gains are unlikely. These results show that\nSPS\neffectively integrates semantic augmentations through an interpretable, text-driven process, enabling scalable generalization via concept-level latent edits.\n4.5\nAblations: efficiency and performance\nBeyond improving generalization, SPS offers substantial computational benefits during both training and inference. By selecting only a subset of patch features, we reduce the overall processing load without sacrificing semantic richness. We explore multiple variants leveraging the SPS mechanism.\nVariants.\nIn the base\nSPS\nvariant, unselected patch descriptors are replaced with zeros, preserving the feature tensor’s original shape. In the more aggressive\nSPPS (Structured Patch Pruning with Selection)\n, unselected tokens are entirely removed; the selected tokens are then spatially reorganized and assigned position embeddings relative to their original location (Method V2 from Section\n3.4\n).\nA third variant,\nMSPPS (Matrix-based Structured Patch Pruning)\n, stochastically prunes patch tokens based on a per-patch probability mask, yielding dynamic, matrix-based sparsity. Notably, it also prunes unselected patches as in SPPS (the combination of V1 and V2 from section\n3.4\n).\nSpeed reported results.\nEach variant is evaluated across three selection rates: 70%, 50%, and 30%. Inference timing was measured over 100 independent runs per model component, with averages reported for the QFormer, vision projection and normalization, BLIP2 convolution, and the ViT policy model. While we train and benchmark nine model variants in total, only six representative models are shown in Table\n4\n, as the\nSPPS\nand\nMSPPS\nvariants are functionally similar in terms of runtime, with any differences being negligible in practice.\nThe\nSPS-50%\nmodel (our best model in terms of accuracy) achieves a\n2.43\n×\n2.43\\times\nspeedup over the SOTA\nDrive-Anywhere\n.\nAt the more aggressive 30% selection rate,\nSPPS\nand\nSPS\nreach\n3.31\n×\n3.31\\times\nand\n3.47\n×\n3.47\\times\nspeedups, respectively. This shows the core trends: a consistent correlation between lower selection rates and improved runtime, highlighting that SPS not only improves generalization, but also enables substantial computational gains, making it attractive for real-world autonomous systems deployment.\nSpeed vs accuracy reported results.\nTo analyse the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy, in Figure\n1\n(4) we show a comparison, where each model is represented by a single node: The x-axis reflects runtime cost, defined as the inverse of the model’s speedup over the baseline -\n1\n/\nT\nFactor\n1/T_{\\text{Factor}}\n(lower is better), while the y-axis reports average closed-loop performance.\nNode color encodes a composite performance score, computed as accuracy divided by runtime (higher is better), highlighting models that strike the best balance between precision and efficiency.\nThe six reported models gain better accuracy while being faster than the drive anywhere model; the improvements of our variant in terms of accuracy vary from\n3.3\n%\n3.3\\%\nto\n6.2\n%\n6.2\\%\n, while the speed improved\n1.69\n×\n1.69\\times\nto\n3.47\n×\n3.47\\times\n.\nWhile our composite performance analysis (Fig.\n1\n(4)) shows that\nSPS-70%\nand\nSPPS-70%\nachieve the highest scores when accuracy and runtime are equally weighted, practical deployment considerations suggest a different weighting scheme.\nIn the context of real-world autonomous driving, reliability and generalization, particularly under OOD conditions, are of higher criticality than marginal gains in computational speed. The\nSPS-50%\nmodel consistently delivers the highest average accuracy across scenarios, and this performance margin is non-trivial in safety-critical systems. We therefore view\nSPS-50%\nas the strongest overall candidate for real-world deployment, offering the best tradeoff between robustness and efficiency.\nThe effect of\nrate\n.\nAs shown in Table\n2\n, most variants outperform the\nDrive-Anywhere\nbenchmark across OOD scenarios, with\nSPS-50%\nachieving the highest accuracy (+6.2%), highlighting the general effectiveness of stochastic patch selection.\nFigure\n5\nplots performance against selection rate for each variant, revealing distinct trends:\nSPS\npeaks at 50%, offering the strongest gain;\nSPPS\nperforms best at 70% and declines with more aggressive pruning; and\nMSPPS\nimproves as selection becomes stricter, peaking at 30%. These findings confirm that stochastic selection improves generalization across architectures, though the optimal ratio varies. Notably, moderate selection rates strike the best tradeoff between redundancy reduction and information retention in models where spatial structure is retained.\nTable 4\n:\nRuntime Efficiency of SPS.\nThe calculations were averaged across\n100\n100\nindependent runs.\nModel\nQformer\nVision Proj.&Norm\nFM Project\nPolicy\nTotal Efficiency\nQformer\nEfficiency\nVP&N\nEfficiency\nFMC\nEfficiency\nPolicy\nEfficiency\nPercentage\nFactor\nBenchmark\n2.17s\n–\n871\nμ\n​\ns\n\\mu s\n–\n540\nμ\n​\ns\n\\mu s\n–\n17\nm\n​\ns\nms\n–\n100\n%\n\\%\nx1\nSPS_\n70\n%\n70\\%\n1.56s\n39.10\n%\n39.10\\%\n839\nμ\n​\ns\n\\mu s\n3.75\n%\n3.75\\%\n376\nμ\n​\ns\n\\mu s\n43.67\n%\n43.67\\%\n20\nm\n​\ns\nms\n0.24\n%\n0.24\\%\n86.52\n%\n86.52\\%\nx1.87\nSPS_\n50\n%\n50\\%\n1.11s\n95.50\n%\n95.50\\%\n855\nμ\n​\ns\n\\mu s\n1.88\n%\n1.88\\%\n370\nμ\n​\ns\n\\mu s\n46.08\n%\n46.08\\%\n20\nm\n​\ns\nms\n−\n1.22\n%\n-1.22\\%\n143.45\n%\n143.45\\%\nx2.43\nSPS_\n30\n%\n30\\%\n0.71s\n205.63\n%\n205.63\\%\n842\nμ\n​\ns\n\\mu s\n3.45\n%\n3.45\\%\n390\nμ\n​\ns\n\\mu s\n38.41\n%\n38.41\\%\n20\nm\n​\ns\nms\n0.41\n%\n0.41\\%\n247.50\n%\n247.50\\%\nx3.47\nSPPS_\n70\n%\n70\\%\n1.56s\n39.10\n%\n39.10\\%\n846\nμ\n​\ns\n\\mu s\n2.93\n%\n2.93\\%\n500\nμ\n​\ns\n\\mu s\n8.06\n%\n8.06\\%\n14.3\nm\n​\ns\nms\n18.92\n%\n18.92\\%\n69.02\n%\n69.02\\%\nx1.69\nSPPS_\n50\n%\n50\\%\n1.11s\n95.50\n%\n95.50\\%\n837\nμ\n​\ns\n\\mu s\n4.06\n%\n4.06\\%\n493\nμ\n​\ns\n\\mu s\n9.41\n%\n9.41\\%\n14.5\nm\n​\ns\nms\n17.45\n%\n17.45\\%\n126.41\n%\n126.41\\%\nx2.26\nSPPS_\n30\n%\n30\\%\n0.71s\n205.63\n%\n205.63\\%\n841\nμ\n​\ns\n\\mu s\n3.58\n%\n3.58\\%\n542\nμ\n​\ns\n\\mu s\n−\n0.44\n%\n-0.44\\%\n13.9\nm\n​\ns\nms\n22.43\n%\n22.43\\%\n231.21\n%\n231.21\\%\nx3.31\nFigure 5\n:\nAccuracy as a function of selection rate across variants.\n4.6\nReal-world car deployment\nWe deployed the\nSPS-50%\nmodel on a full-scale autonomous vehicle (see supplementary video). The experiments took place during the spring season at two distinct locations: a rural road within a public park and an underground parking garage.\nIn the rural scenario, the vehicle successfully performed lane-following under natural daylight conditions, confirming the model’s ability to transfer from simulation to the real world. The underground scenario was a challenging OOD test case, featuring low-light conditions, the absence of clear lanes, and visually cluttered geometry, such as perpendicular parking lines, parked vehicles, and distractor objects. Despite never encountering such a configuration at training, the vehicle executed the correct motion.\nIn addition, it successfully avoided static obstacles, including cones and boxes, further demonstrating its robustness. Representative frames from both real-world scenarios, captured from onboard and external views, are shown in Figure\n4\n.\n5\nConclusion and future work\nThis work shows that patch-aligned features (extracted from vision–language models) used for training driving policies are correlated and redundant. Motivated by this, it introduced SPS: a stochastic patch–masking strategy that tackles the redundancy inevitably built into such features. By randomly suppressing a fraction of patch descriptors while preserving their spatial arrangement, SPS forces the policy to ground its decisions on features that are robust to which tokens survive. Across a diverse suite of closed-loop driving scenarios, covering weather, lighting and geographic domain shifts, SPS delivers a\n6.2%\naverage gain in OOD success rate, peaks at\n20.4%\nimprovement in the hardest scenarios, and speeds inference by\n2.4\n×\n\\times\ncompared with the previous SOTA.\nThe same mechanism enables text-conditioned data augmentation in the latent patch space, yielding more\n1.7%\nboost without extra image synthesis. Ablations confirm that the benefit is robust to (reasonable) selection rates, selection methods, and feature re-ordering schemes: 8 out of the 9 trained systems surpassed the prior SOTA. We demonstrated that policies trained with SPS in simulation transfer to a real-world autonomous vehicle with\nno\nextra fine-tuning, highlighting the practical relevance of the approach.\nFuture work\nincludes sophisticated selection techniques (i) learning a state-dependent sampling policy that select the number of patches to allocate based on scenes, and (ii) going beyond uniform sampling by\ninspecting\nthe descriptors themselves, e.g., coreset selection, attention entropy, or mutual-information scores, to drop provably redundant patches, further sharpening both efficiency and robustness.\nAcknowledgments\nAlaa Maalouf acknowledges support from the Neubauer Family Foundation and from the MAOF Fellowship of the Council for Higher Education.

    "preview_text": "Recent advances in end-to-end autonomous driving show that policies trained on patch-aligned features extracted from foundation models generalize better to Out-of-Distribution (OOD). We hypothesize that due to the self-attention mechanism, each patch feature implicitly embeds/contains information from all other patches, represented in a different way and intensity, making these descriptors highly redundant. We quantify redundancy in such (BLIP2) features via PCA and cross-patch similarity: $90$% of variance is captured by $17/64$ principal components, and strong inter-token correlations are pervasive. Training on such overlapping information leads the policy to overfit spurious correlations, hurting OOD robustness. We present Stochastic-Patch-Selection (SPS), a simple yet effective approach for learning policies that are more robust, generalizable, and efficient. For every frame, SPS randomly masks a fraction of patch descriptors, not feeding them to the policy model, while preserving the spatial layout of the remaining patches. Thus, the policy is provided with different stochastic but complete views of the (same) scene: every random subset of patches acts like a different, yet still sensible, coherent projection of the world. The policy thus bases its decisions on features that are invariant to which specific tokens survive. Extensive experiments confirm that across all OOD scenarios, our method outperforms the state of the art (SOTA), achieving a $6.2$% average improvement and up to $20.4$% in closed-loop simulations, while being $2.4\\times$ faster. We conduct ablations over masking rates and patch-feature reorganization, training and evaluating 9 systems, with 8 of them surpassing prior SOTA. Finally, we show that the same learned policy transfers to a physical, real-world car without any tuning.\n\nSee Less, Drive Better: Generalizable End-to-End Autonomous Driving via Foundation Models Stochastic Patch Selection\nAmir Mallak\n1\nErfan Aasi\n2\nShiva Sreeram\n2\nTsun-Hs",

            "question": "论文的主要局限性有哪些？未来可能的改进方向是什么？",
            "answer": "## 论文《See Less, Drive Better》的主要局限性与未来改进方向分析\n\n基于对论文内容的深入分析，其提出的**随机块选择（SPS）**方法虽然在提升端到端自动驾驶的泛化性、鲁棒性和效率方面取得了显著成果，但仍存在一些局限性，并指明了未来的研究方向。\n\n### 主要局限性\n\n1.  **随机选择策略的简单性**\n    - **当前方法**：SPS采用**均匀随机**的方式丢弃块描述符。虽然有效，但这是一种**无信息、无状态**的随机过程，可能不是最优的。\n    - **潜在问题**：在复杂或危险场景中（如突然出现的行人、恶劣天气），随机丢弃关键信息块可能会暂时降低感知能力，尽管训练鼓励了鲁棒性，但在极端边缘情况下可能存在风险。\n\n2.  **对基础模型特征的依赖**\n    - **方法前提**：SPS的有效性建立在基础模型（如BLIP-2）提取的块特征本身具有高度**冗余性**的前提下。如果未来基础模型的架构或训练目标发生改变，减少了这种内在冗余，SPS的增益可能会减弱。\n    - **特征提取开销**：尽管SPS减少了输入策略网络的令牌数量，加速了后续计算，但**特征提取过程**（运行大型基础模型）仍然是计算瓶颈。SPS仅部分缓解了此问题。\n\n3.  **超参数（丢弃率）的敏感性**\n    - **实验发现**：论文的消融研究表明，不同变体（SPS, SPPS, MSPPS）的**最优丢弃率（rate）** 不同（如SPS在50%最佳，SPPS在70%最佳）。这表明性能对丢弃率的选择有一定敏感性，需要针对具体架构进行调整，而非一个普适的最优值。\n\n4.  **理论分析的理想化假设**\n    - **理论支撑**：论文中的引理1（关于子空间保持）依赖于**低秩和有界相干性**的假设。虽然实验数据（PCA分析）支持低秩性，但现实世界数据的复杂性可能使这些理论保证在实际中弱化。\n\n5.  **评估环境的限制**\n    - **仿真主导**：主要评估在CARLA/VISTA等仿真环境中进行。尽管有成功的**仿真到现实（Sim-to-Real）** 迁移演示，但真实世界的长尾场景、极端天气和复杂交互的多样性和不可预测性远高于当前测试范围。\n\n### 未来可能的改进方向\n\n论文在结论部分明确提出了未来工作方向，与上述局限性相呼应：\n\n1.  **更智能的选择策略**\n    - **状态依赖的采样**：学习一个**依赖于场景状态**的采样策略，动态决定每个帧需要保留多少以及哪些块。例如，在简单直道上可以丢弃更多，在复杂交叉口则保留更多关键信息。\n    - **基于信息的采样**：超越随机均匀采样，采用**核心集选择、注意力熵或互信息评分**等方法，主动丢弃那些被证明信息量最少或冗余度最高的块，从而在保持性能的同时最大化效率。\n\n2.  **与基础模型的高效协同**\n    - **轻量级特征提取**：探索与SPS思想协同的、更轻量的基础模型或特征提取管道，从源头降低计算成本。\n    - **自适应基础模型**：研究如何对基础模型进行**微小的、针对性的调整**，使其产生的特征冗余度更低，或与下游驾驶策略的学习目标更对齐，而不是完全冻结。\n\n3.  **架构与方法的扩展**\n    - **时序建模集成**：当前工作主要处理单帧。未来可以将SPS思想扩展到**时序模型**中，研究如何在连续帧间进行随机块选择，以学习对动态场景更鲁棒的时序表示。\n    - **多模态融合增强**：除了视觉块特征，探索如何将SPS的随机选择思想应用于**多模态融合**（如LiDAR点云、雷达数据）中，以提升在传感器失效或噪声情况下的鲁棒性。\n\n4.  **更全面的评估与理论深化**\n    - **大规模真实世界测试**：在更广泛、更长期的真实道路测试中验证SPS的鲁棒性和安全性，收集真正的长尾案例。\n    - **更坚实的理论框架**：发展更完善的理论，分析在**数据分布偏移、对抗性扰动**等更严峻条件下，随机块选择对策略泛化能力的影响边界。\n\n**总结而言**，该论文的核心局限性在于其“随机丢弃”机制的简单性以及对现有基础模型冗余结构的依赖。未来的改进将聚焦于将“随机”变为“智能”，并推动整个感知-决策管道向更高效、更鲁棒的方向演进。其提出的“少即是多（less can be more）”哲学为后续研究提供了一个富有潜力的方向。",
