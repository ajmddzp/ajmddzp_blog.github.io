This dual responsibility presents a significant challenge to the design and implementation of coaxial bi-copter systems.\nThus, it is hard to balance efficiency, maneuverability, and compactness in coaxial bi-copter systems without considering all factors systematically.\nFigure 1:\n(a). A center-of-gravity (CoG) shifting driven coaxial bi-copter AAV muFly by Bermes\net al\n.\n[\n9\n]\n(b). Aerodynamic control surfaces coaxial bi-copter AAV CanFly by Pan\net al\n.\n[\n10\n]\n(c). A swashplateless duct coaxial bi-copter AAV Halo by Li\net al\n.\n[\n11\n]\n(d). A servo-controlled coaxial bi-copter AAV by Chen\net al\n.\n[\n12\n]\n(e). A gimbal-controlled coaxial bi-copter AAV GimbalHawk by Reddington\net al\n[\n13\n]\n.\n(f). A coaxial bi-copter AAV CoAX with swashplate cyclic pitch control by Fankhauser\net al\n.\n[\n14\n]\nIn this work, we present\nCOMET\n(Coaxial Bi-copter AAV with High-Maneuverability and Long-Endurance).\nCOMET integrates a coaxial bi-copter system with a dual swashplate cyclic pitch mechanism.\nThe dual swashplate cyclic pitch mechanism enables the independent actuation of both rotors, providing improved agility.\nThe rotor system is optimized through bench tests, which define the optimal rotor separation distance and installation angle, ensuring optimal rotor system efficiency while maintaining compactness.\nComparative experiments in endurance and maneuverability validate the effectiveness of our system.\nThe main contributions of this work are as follows:\n•\nDesign and implementation of COMET:\nWe introduce a coaxial bi-copter AAV equipped with a dual swashplate cyclic pitch control system, enabling independent actuation of the upper and lower rotors to significantly enhance maneuverability.\n•\nOptimization of the coaxial bi-copter system:\nWe conduct systematic testbench experiments to jointly optimize rotor separation distance and blade installation angle, improving rotor system efficiency while preserving a compact vertical profile.\n•\nComprehensive experimental validation:\nWe validate the endurance of COMET’s rotor system under varying load conditions, the necessity of the dual swashplate configuration for dynamic flight, compared to the single swashplate setup, and the autonomous capabilities in unknown environments through extensive and sufficient experiments.\nFigure 2:\n(a). General schematic of COMET.

Swashplate-based cyclic pitch control, through thrust-vector tilting and flapping dynamics, is demonstrated to enhance maneuverability in coaxial bi-copter AAVs\n[\n14\n]\n.\nAdditionally, swashplate-based cyclic pitch control is proven to improve efficiency and control response in small-scale AAVs\n[\n24\n]\n, further supporting its use in coaxial bi-copter systems.\nII-B\nRotor System Optimization\nThe primary challenge in coaxial bi-copter system design stems from airflow interference between the rotors.\nThis interference introduces substantial aerodynamic disturbances, negatively impacting overall system performance.\nMitigating such effects hinges on optimizing two critical rotor design parameters: (1). the vertical separation distance between rotors, and (2). the blade installation angle.\nThe vertical spacing between the upper and lower rotors is a primary factor influencing wake interaction, as identified in prior works\n[\n17\n,\n14\n,\n25\n,\n26\n,\n27\n,\n28\n]\n.\nRamasamy\net al.\n[\n25\n,\n28\n]\nexperimentally demonstrate that inadequate vertical spacing leads to severe wake impingement on the lower rotor, reducing its effective lift and increasing the power required to maintain thrust equilibrium.\nBuzzatto\net al.\n[\n8\n]\ndevelop an open-source testbench to benchmark coaxial rotor systems and systematically analyze the relationship between mechanical and electrical power with respect to rotor separation ratio across varying rotor diameters.\nThe blade installation angle, including pitch and coning angles, also plays a critical role in influencing rotor–rotor aerodynamic interaction in coaxial systems.\nHai\net al.\n[\n26\n]\nnote that slight variations in installation angles can significantly alter the pressure distribution across rotor planes, affecting stability and efficiency.\nAdditionally, Lakshminarayan and Baeder\n[\n27\n]\nshow through computational fluid dynamics that carefully adjusting blade pitch profiles promotes smoother inflow and reduces local flow separation in coaxial configurations, thereby improving aerodynamic performance.\nTogether, these findings highlight the importance of jointly optimizing rotor separation and blade installation geometry to minimize interference effects, thereby ensuring optimal rotor system efficiency while maintaining compactness.\nIII\nSystem Design, Optimization and Implementation\nIII-A\nSystem Overview and Propulsion Architecture\nCOMET integrates three core subsystems: the power system, the propulsion system, and the perception and computing system, as illustrated in Fig.\n2\n(a).\nThe whole system height of the COMET is 450 mm and approximately 66 mm in diameter in the folded state, as shown in Fig.\n2\n(b).\nThe power system supports interchangeable battery packs with varying capacities to accommodate diverse mission requirements, including 3000 mAh and 5000 mAh 6s Li-ion battery options.\nThe perception and computing system comprises an NVIDIA Orin NX onboard computer for high-level planning and decision-making, and a Holybro Kakute H7 flight control unit for low-level control execution.\nOnboard sensing is provided by either an Intel RealSense D430 stereo camera or a Livox Mid-360 LiDAR, depending on the mission requirements.\nThe propulsion system is based on a coaxial bi-copter configuration, with two DT-5008 brushless DC (BLDC) motors, two-pair propeller mounts with 16x6 two-blade carbon composite propellers, and two swashplates.\nAll assemblies are mounted on a stainless steel shaft, as shown in Fig.\n2\n(c).\nThe elevator and aileron servo inputs for the upper and lower swashplates are denoted as\nδ\nele\n,\nu\n​\np\n\\delta_{\\mathrm{ele},up}\nand\nδ\nail\n,\nu\n​\np\n\\delta_{\\mathrm{ail},up}\n,\nδ\nele\n,\nd\n​\nw\n\\delta_{\\mathrm{ele},dw}\nand\nδ\nail\n,\nd\n​\nw\n\\delta_{\\mathrm{ail},dw}\n, with identical control signals, i.e.,\nδ\nele\n,\nu\n​\np\n=\nδ\nele\n,\nd\n​\nw\n\\delta_{\\mathrm{ele},up}=\\delta_{\\mathrm{ele},dw}\n, and\nδ\nail\n,\nu\n​\np\n=\nδ\nail\n,\nd\n​\nw\n\\delta_{\\mathrm{ail},up}=\\delta_{\\mathrm{ail},dw}\n.\nThe rotorhead combines flapping and lead–lag hinges, producing a compact assembly with favorable rotor dynamics.\nThe blades are mounted onto the propeller mounts with a specific installation angle via lead-lag hinges, as shown in Fig.\n2\n(d).\nThe lead–lag hinges, shown in Fig.\n2\n(e), permit in-plane blade motion, relieving the asymmetric aerodynamic and inertial loads during aggressive maneuvers, enhancing flight stability\n[\n29\n]\n.\nThe propeller mounts are connected to the rotorhead through flapping hinges, enabling out-of-plane flapping motion around the hinge axis, as illustrated in Fig.\n2\n(f).\nCOMET has a projected diameter of 465 mm, with blades folding downward for compact storage, reducing the platform’s maximum diameter to 66 mm and achieving a 98.0% reduction in projected area.\nThe overall components of COMET are shown in Table.\nI\n.\nTo verify COMET’s structural robustness, we conducted finite element modal simulations to analyze structural modes and performed Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) using IMU data during hover flight to identify vibration modes.\nThe results show that the actual vibration mode at 23 Hz is close to the simulated modes (28.3 Hz and 31.5 Hz), all well separated from the 45 Hz rotor frequency, ensuring no structural resonance.\nCumulative flight tests over 100 hours confirm no performance degradation, excessive vibration, or structural failures, supporting the robustness and reliability of COMET’s propulsion system and design.\nTABLE I:\nWeight and Model of Each Component\nCategory\nComponent\nModel\nWeight (g)\nPower\nSystem\nBattery 1\n5000mAh 21700\n480\nBattery 2\n3000mAh

system is a central element of COMET’s mechanical design, engineered to achieve compact integration within a limited vertical envelope while enhancing efficiency under the premise of a compact longitudinal structure.\nThe vertical separation distance\nz\nz\nbetween the upper rotor and lower rotor, as well as the installation angle of each blade, are critical parameters that directly affect rotor–rotor interaction, lift symmetry, and overall control efficiency.\nAn optimized vertical separation distance\nz\nz\ncan mitigate aerodynamic interference between the rotors while influencing the system’s center of gravity and thrust allocation.\nSimilarly, a carefully adjusted installation angle can improve lift distribution and enhance control responsiveness.\nWe experimentally evaluate these parameters to quantify their effects on propulsion efficiency and guide the final design configuration of COMET.\nThe thrust generated by the motor was measured using an SRI M3813B high-precision force and torque sensor.\nThe sensor offers a maximum force error of 0.04 N and a maximum torque error of 0.009 N·m within its rated measurement range.\nThe motors are rigidly mounted on the force sensor, and the sensors themselves are securely fixed to the test rig.\nDuring the experiment, both motors are operated at equal torque, with the total throttle fixed at 40% to replicate COMET’s hover condition.\nAs shown in Fig.\n3\n(a), with the increase in the normalized separation distance\nz\n/\nD\nz/D\n, where\nD\nD\nis the rotor diameter, the thrust generated by the lower rotor also increases.\nThe result suggests that increasing the vertical spacing effectively mitigates rotor–rotor interaction.\nConsequently, the overall efficiency of the system gradually improves and tends to stabilize when the separation ratio reaches\nz\n/\nD\n=\n0.17\nz/D=0.17\n, which corresponds to a separation of 79 mm, as illustrated in Fig.\n3\n(b).\nSince further increasing\nz\n/\nD\nz/D\nyields no significant improvement in system efficiency,\nz\n=\n79\n​\nm\n​\nm\nz=79~mm\nis selected as the rotor system design parameter to maintain structural compactness.\nInstallation angle tests are conducted at the fixed optimal separation distance of 79 mm.\nAs the lower rotor is more exposed to the aerodynamic wake of the upper rotor, optimizing its installation angle is likely to produce a greater improvement in thrust efficiency\n[\n30\n]\n.\nTherefore, only the lower rotor’s installation angle is tested, ranging from –1° to +1.5°, at 0.5° intervals.\nAs shown in Fig.\n3\n(c) and (d), both the lower rotor thrust and the overall system efficiency increase with the installation angle.\nThrust magnitude and efficiency are both maximized at\n+\n1\n∘\n+1^{\\circ}\n, and then begin to decline.\nTherefore, we chose\n+\n1\n∘\n+1^{\\circ}\nas the installation angle for the lower blades.\nFigure 3:\n(a)(b) Thrust and efficiency versus normalized separation distance (\nz\n/\nD\nz/D\n).\n(c)(d) Thrust and efficiency versus installation angle of the lower rotor.\nTo verify the effectiveness of the COMET dual swashplate configuration in providing control torque compared to the single swashplate configuration, we conduct testbench experiments to measure the differences in maximum control torque between the single swashplate and dual swashplate configurations.\nWe recorded the average of the maximum and minimum values of the control torque generated by cyclic pitch and its trend as the normalized thrust changed, as shown in Fig.\n4\n.\nThe results indicate that the maximum control torque provided by the COMET cyclic pitch mechanism is related to the normalized thrust and varies linearly with it.\nThe maximum control torque of the COMET with the dual swashplate configuration is higher than that of both single swashplate configurations.\nCompared to the single swashplate configuration on the upper rotor, the dual swashplate configuration increases the control torque by 116.7%, and compared to the single swashplate configuration on the lower rotor, the dual swashplate configuration increases the control torque by 72.51%.\nThe results demonstrate the effectiveness of the dual swashplate configuration in enhancing the maximum control torque.\nFigure 4:\nTestbench torque results, blue for dual swashplate configuration, orange for single swashplate configuration on lower rotor, green for single swashplate configuration on upper rotor.\nIV\nModeling and Controller Design\nFigure 5:\nReference frame

Although COMET is equipped with six actuators, the small vertical spacing between its upper and lower rotors, combined with the need to prevent blade interference, restricts its ability to achieve full six-degree-of-freedom control.\nAs a result, similar to conventional multirotors, COMET is treated as an underactuated vehicle.\nThis work focuses on near-hover and low-speed flight conditions, where aerodynamic drag is negligible and external forces primarily act along the body’s\nz\nz\n-axis.\nUnder these assumptions, the net body force\n𝑭\nℬ\n\\bm{F}^{\\mathcal{B}}\ncan be reasonably approximated as being parallel to\n𝒛\nℬ\n\\bm{z}^{\\mathcal{B}}\n.\nThis simplification makes COMET’s dynamic behavior analogous to that of traditional quadrotors, allowing the direct application of differential flatness.\nConsequently, the existing quadrotor trajectory planning method can be readily adapted for COMET.\nFigure 7:\nCOMET applications in various scenarios. (a). The composite snapshot demonstrates COMET executing a figure-eight trajectory tracking maneuver. (b). COMET is autonomously navigating in a well-lit, cluttered environment. (c). COMET is autonomously navigating in a dimly-lit, cluttered environment.\nIV-B2\nCascaded Controller\nThe COMET’s position controller employs a cascaded structure with velocity and acceleration feedforward.\nFeedforward terms are derived from the motion planning module, utilizing the first and second derivatives of the reference trajectory as velocity and acceleration inputs, respectively.\nThe position controller employs a cascaded structure with a proportional gain, calculating the desired velocity.\nThe velocity controller computes the desired acceleration\n𝒂\nd\nℐ\n\\bm{a}_{d}^{\\mathcal{I}}\nvia a PID controller.\nThe corresponding desired attitude\n𝐑\nd\n\\mathbf{R}_{d}\nand thrust force\n𝑻\nd\nℬ\n\\bm{T}^{\\mathcal{B}}_{d}\nare determined from the desired acceleration\n𝒂\nd\nℐ\n\\bm{a}_{d}^{\\mathcal{I}}\nand the gravity force\nm\n​\n𝒈\nm\\bm{g}\n, following the differential flatness formulation described in\n[\n31\n]\n:\nm\n​\n𝒂\nd\nℐ\n=\nm\n​\n𝒈\n+\n𝐑\nd\n​\n𝑻\nd\nℬ\n.\nm\\bm{a}_{d}^{\\mathcal{I}}=m\\bm{g}+\\mathbf{R}_{d}\\bm{T}^{\\mathcal{B}}_{d}.\n(5)\nThe attitude controller adopts a dual-loop PID control strategy, with an outer loop for attitude control based on quaternion error and an inner loop for angular rate control.\nV\nExperiments\nV-A\nHover Flight Endurance\nHovering flight time is one of the core performance metrics of the COMET.\nTo validate the effectiveness of COMET’s optimization for efficiency, we conduct endurance tests under hovering conditions with varying take-off weight configurations.\nThe experimental results are summarized in Table\nII\n.\nWith a battery capacity of 66.6 Wh and a take-off weight of 1250 g, COMET achieves a hover time of 24.3 min and a power efficiency of 7.66 g/W.\nBy using a larger battery as an additional payload, COMET can further extend its endurance to 35.5 minutes.\nHowever, due to the 16.8% increase in additional load compared to the standard configuration, COMET’s efficiency decreases to 7.15 g/W.\nBy further increasing the additional payload, the take-off weight of COMET is raised to 1940 g, resulting in a 55.2% increase in additional load compared to the standard configuration, as a result, COMET’s efficiency further decreases to 6.00 g/W.\nCompared to existing coaxial bi-copters with reported flight efficiency, such as HALO\n[\n11\n]\nand GimbalHawk\n[\n13\n]\n, as well as commercial multicopter AAVs with the same projected area (DJI Air 2S), COMET demonstrates an advantage in hover efficiency.\nThe above results demonstrate the effectiveness of COMET’s propulsion system design and efficiency optimization.\nCOMET is capable of carrying a sufficiently large battery for tasks requiring extended endurance, maintaining a long flight time and high efficiency, while also ensuring that its flight efficiency does not significantly decrease when carrying additional payloads.\nFigure 8:\nCOMET trajectory tracking performance under different swashplate configurations, trajectory types, and maximum velocity.

experiment, COMET is tasked with tracking a predefined circle trajectory with a diameter of\n5\n​\nm\n5\\,\\mathrm{m}\nand a figure-eight trajectory within a\n10\n​\nm\n×\n5\n​\nm\n10\\,\\mathrm{m}\\times 5\\,\\mathrm{m}\narea, using the NOKOV motion capture system for precise state estimation.\nThe maximum speed for the generated circular trajectory is set to 3 m/s and 4 m/s, while the maximum speed for the figure-eight trajectory is set to 3.5 m/s, 4 m/s, and 5 m/s.\nTo evaluate the necessity of the dual swashplate configuration for maneuverability, we include a comparison with a single swashplate version of COMET.\nIn this configuration, the cyclic pitch mechanism of the upper rotor is disabled, while all controller parameters are kept identical across both configurations.\nMeanwhile, to record the efficiency during dynamic flight missions, a CUAV HV PM power meter is installed on COMET to measure high-precision voltage and current data during flight.\nThe total take-off weight of COMET in trajectory tracking tasks is 1340g.\nFig.\n7\n(a) presents a composite snapshot from one of the trajectory tracking experiments, and the various trajectory tracking results in X and Y positions are shown in Fig.\n8\n.\nThe additional control torque provided by the dual swashplate mechanism enhanced COMET’s tracking performance in these tasks, as demonstrated by the comparison between Fig.\n8\n(a) and (b), as well as between (c) and (d).\nHowever, in the figure-eight trajectory tracking task with a maximum speed of 4 m/s, COMET with the single swashplate configuration lost control at the first turn due to actuator saturation.\nIn contrast, COMET with the dual swashplate configuration is able to effectively track figure-eight trajectories with maximum speeds of 4 m/s and 5 m/s, as shown in Fig.\n8\n(e) and (f).\nThe corresponding quantitative results are summarized in Table\nIII\n.\nIn the circular trajectory tracking task with a maximum speed of 3 m/s, COMET with the dual swashplate configuration reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) by 41.12% and the maximum absolute error (MAE) by 44.54% compared to the single swashplate configuration.\nIn the circular trajectory with a maximum speed of 4 m/s, the RMSE is reduced by 20.01% and the MAE by 28.69%.\nIn the figure-eight trajectory with a maximum speed of 3.5 m/s, the RMSE is reduced by 21.33% and the MAE by 34.06%.\nIn the figure-eight trajectory tracking task with a maximum speed of 4 m/s, COMET with the single swashplate configuration is unable to complete the flight task.\nHowever, COMET with the dual swashplate configuration achieves an RMSE of 0.2876 m and an MAE of 0.5650 m.\nFurthermore, COMET with the dual swashplate configuration successfully tracks the figure-eight trajectory with a maximum speed of 5 m/s, achieving an RMSE of 0.3052 m and an MAE of 0.6526 m.\nWe evaluate the normalized control inputs of COMET’s cyclic pitch during flight under two different configurations.\nThe rate controller outputs are normalized to cyclic pitch control inputs ranging from -1 to 1 through the mixer.\nWe count the maximum amount of pitch and roll normalized control for different cyclic pitch configurations in the trajectory tracking task.\nAs shown in Table.\nIII\n, the COMET with the single swashplate configuration experiences saturation in the cyclic pitch control inputs for both roll and pitch control (i.e., absolute normalized control inputs reaching 1) in the circular trajectory tracking task with a maximum speed of 4 m/s.\nIn contrast, the dual swashplate configuration does not exhibit control input saturation under the maximum flight speed of 5m/s.\nThese results indicate that the dual swashplate configuration can provide sufficient control torque for agile flight.\nFinally, we calculate the average power, maximum power, and efficiency of COMET in the trajectory tracking tasks, as shown in Table\nIII\n.\nThe experimental results indicate that COMET with the dual swashplate configuration, compared to the single swashplate configuration, can reduce power consumption and improve efficiency to some extent during dynamic flight.\nIn the circular trajectory with a maximum speed of 3 m/s, the dual swashplate configuration reduces the average power by 9.26% and the maximum power by 17.68% compared to the single swashplate configuration.\nIn the circular trajectory with a maximum speed of 4 m/s, the average power is reduced by 1.72% and the maximum power by 1.71%.\nIn the figure-eight trajectory with a maximum speed of 3.5 m/s, the average power decreases by 4.03% and the maximum power by 12.43%.\nThis improvement is due to the reduced amplitude of cyclic pitch variation, which decreases the fluctuations in the TPP inclination angle, thereby reducing the fluctuations in the aircraft’s thrust.\nAs a result, both the average power and maximum power decrease, leading to an improvement in COMET’s flight efficiency.\nV-C\nAutonomous Navigation with Different Sensing Configurations\nWe present several experiments in cluttered, unknown environments to validate the overall system integration of COMET.\nWe use the Ego-planner\n[\n32\n]\nframework for trajectory planning.\nThe waypoint is provided in advance and is located 15 meters away from the take-off position.\nDepending on the lighting conditions, we configure different perception sensors to adapt to the environment.\nIn well-lit conditions, we use VINS-Fusion\n[\n33\n]\nfor visual-inertial state estimation.\nIn dimly-lit conditions, we use a lidar-inertial odometry (LIO) system, leveraging FAST-LIO2\n[\n34\n]\nfor robust localization.\nThe snapshots from the flight tests are shown Fig.\n7\n(b) and (c).\nWe refer readers to the supplementary video for more information.\nCOMET successfully completes autonomous navigation tasks in both conditions, demonstrating the platform’s versatility and robustness across various sensing modalities and environments.\nVI\nConclusion and Future Work\nThe COMET proposed in this letter features a dual swashplate coaxial bi-copter system.\nThe vertical separation distance and the blade installation angle of the coaxial bi-copter system are optimized through bench tests, ensuring the optimal rotor system efficiency while maintaining compactness.\nComparative endurance tests confirm that COMET achieves a hover efficiency of up to 7.66 g/W and demonstrates its robustness under varying payload conditions.\nBench tests and comprehensive trajectory tracking experiments, compared to the single swashplate configuration, demonstrate the necessity of the dual swashplate configuration for dynamic flight performance.\nAutonomous flight trials further confirm COMET’s potential for real-world missions.\nHowever, the current trajectory tracking performance of COMET is constrained by rotor drag and the induced torque disturbances relative to the aircraft’s CoG, limiting further improvements in its tracking capability.\nFuture work will focus on developing a specific trajectory generation and tracking control framework for high-speed flights.\nReferences\n[1]\nV. Sprincean, A. Paladi, V. Andruh, A. Danici, P. Lozovanu, and F. Paladi, “Uav-based measuring station for monitoring and
