However, agents trained in fixed, well-defined environments frequently fail when confronted with the inherent real-world dynamic variability\nDulac-Arnold\net al.\n(\n2021\n); Tambe\net al.\n(\n1995\n); Kormushev\net al.\n(\n2013\n)\n. This gap between static training regimes and dynamic deployment environments remains a central challenge in robotics and embodied intelligence.\nFigure 1:\nTT-VLA supplements to SFT/RL-trained VLAs\nby continuously adapting policies to environment-derived rewards at test time, improving robustness to distributional shifts without retraining.\nCurrent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models stand at the heart of this challenge. These VLAs integrate perception, language understanding, and control to translate visual observations and natural language instructions into executable actions, representing a significant step and performance gains\ntoward general-purpose embodied intelligence\nKim\net al.\n(\n2024\n); Brohan\net al.\n(\n2023\n); Zitkovich\net al.\n(\n2023\n); Wang\net al.\n(\n2025b\n); Kwok\net al.\n(\n2025\n)\n. Yet,\nmost VLAs remain bound to fixed policies, which are generally trained either through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or through training-time reinforcement learning (RL) on curated datasets, explicit fine-tuning phases, and controlled environments.\nIn practice, these rigid policies limit VLAs’ capacity\nfor challenging simulated-/physical-world applications, where\nrobots must adapt at test time as conditions evolve or distribution shifts\n.\nIn a broader perspective, current research in language or vision\nunderstanding has begun to explore\ntest-time training (TTT)\nZuo\net al.\n(\n2025\n); Li\net al.\n(\n2025c\n); Karmanov\net al.\n(\n2024\n); Hu\net al.\n(\n2024\n); Ma\net al.\n(\n2023\n)\nto update models directly on incoming test streams, often without ground-truth labels, underscoring a promising direction toward flexible model adjustments. These advances have emerged in other domains, leaving VLA test-time adaptation largely underexplored. We further find that current TTT cannot be directly applied to VLAs, as the multimodal nature brings substantial distributional shifts and is evolving (see §\n4.5\n).\nIn light of this view, we propose a\nT\nest-\nT\nime Reinforcement Learning framework for\nVLA\n(TT-VLA) that performs online inference-time policy fine-tuning efficiently without retraining cycles, preserving SFT/training-time RL priors while closing the loop with dense inference-time reward signals.\nHere, TTT provides accessibility for test-time adaptation, while RL complements it by addressing substantial variations in environmental conditions and underlying distributions.\nDifferent from traditional session-based RL (\ni.e\n.\n, SimpleVLA-RL), we creatively derive dense shaping signals from task-agnostic proxies to timely and effectively utilize the limited test-time information and optimize the VLA policy. These shaping signals operate independently across time frames, enabling stable, versatile, and continuous adjustments.\nOur design also bridges the prevailing offline-RL/VLA pipeline and the demands of real-world robotics, enabling continuous self-improvement under dynamic, previously unseen conditions. Extensive experiments conducted in both simulated and real-world robotic environments demonstrate that our method can naturally boost the performance of existing SFT-/RL-based approaches.\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\nVLA Generalization & Adaptation\nCurrent VLAs\nBrohan\net al.\n(\n2023\n); Mees\net al.\n(\n2022\n); Pong\net al.\n(\n2020\n); Kwok\net al.\n(\n2025\n)\nare predominantly optimized via supervised fine-tuning on large, curated triplets\nZitkovich\net al.\n(\n2023\n); Kim\net al.\n(\n2024\n); Plaat\net al.\n(\n2024\n); Jiang\net al.\n(\n2025b\n); Kim\net al.\n(\n2025\n); Liu\net al.\n(\n2024a\n)\n, which yields strong performance in static, well-structured settings but leads to brittle behavior and limited robustness under distributional shifts due to the lack of adaptive learning mechanisms\nShenfeld\net al.\n(\n2025\n); Chen\net al.\n(\n2025a\n); Xu\net al.\n(\n2024\n); Chen\net al.\n(\n2025b\n); Wang\net al.\n(\n2025a\n)\n.\nTo address these limitations, recent studies have explored integrating VLAs with reinforcement learning. RL allows policies to actively interact with pre-collected environments or demonstrations, thereby enabling continual adaptation and performance improvement beyond static supervision\nHuang\net al.\n(\n2025\n); Zhang\net al.\n(\n2025\n); Mark\net al.\n(\n2024\n); Chen\net al.\n(\n2025c\n); Ye\net al.\n(\n2025\n); Li\net al.\n(\n2025a\n); Lu\net al.\n(\n2025\n); Jiang\net al.\n(\n2025a\n); Chen and Li (\n2025\n); Wu\net al.\n(\n2021\n); Guo\net al.\n(\n2025b\n)\n. By incorporating interaction-driven feedback, RL-augmented VLAs refine their behaviors to task-specific objectives\nHuang\net al.\n(\n2025\n); Zhang\net al.\n(\n2025\n); Mark\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\nand environmental variations\nChen\net al.\n(\n2025c\n); Ye\net al.\n(\n2025\n); Li\net al.\n(\n2025a\n); Lu\net al.\n(\n2025\n); Jiang\net al.\n(\n2025a\n); Chen and Li (\n2025\n); Wu\net al.\n(\n2021\n); Li\net al.\n(\n2025b\n); Guo\net al.\n(\n2025b\n)\n, demonstrating improved sample efficiency and generalization across unseen scenarios.\nDespite these advances, existing RL approaches still adhere to a training-deployment separation paradigm,\nwithout mechanism for inference-time adaptation once the model is deployed. This gap leaves VLAs vulnerable to unanticipated dynamics\nduring testing, where\nretraining is impractical due to time or data constraints.\n2.2\nTest-Time Training\nTest-time training (TTT) is originally proposed for adapting pre-trained models to a target domain using only unlabeled test data\nSun\net al.\n(\n2020\n); Hu\net al.\n(\n2025\n); Yoon\net al.\n(\n2024\n); Xiao\net al.\n(\n2025\n); Zhu\net al.\n(\n2024\n); Zuo\net al.\n(\n2025\n)\n. Unlike SFT\nJia\net al.\n(\n2022\n); Mosbach\net al.\n(\n2021\n); Han\net al.\n(\n2023\n); Wang\net al.\n(\n2025a\n); Liu\net al.\n(\n2025b\n,\n2024b\n); Hu\net al.\n(\n2022\n); Zeng\net al.\n(\n2024\n); Wang\net al.\n(\n2024b\n)\nor traditional RL\nSutton\net al.\n(\n1999a\n); Guo\net al.\n(\n2025a\n); Huang\net al.\n(\n2025\n); Zhang\net al.\n(\n2025\n); Mark\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\n,\nTTT leverages self-supervised objectives (\ne.g\n.\n, entropy minimization) to calibrate models during inference, thereby enabling effective domain adaptation in the absence of both human-curated labels and external feedback.\nIntuitively, TTT can be naturally extended to VLAs to enable efficient adaptation during inference. However, unlike relatively intuitive single-domain tasks (\ne.g\n.\n, vision, language), where pre-trained models exhibit high generalization capability\nBrown\net al.\n(\n2020\n); Wei\net al.\n(\n2022\n); Goyal\net al.\n(\n2023\n)\nand inter-task discrepancies are relatively minor\nHu\net al.\n(\n2025\n); Liu\net al.\n(\n2021\n); Zhao\net al.\n(\n2023\n); Han\net al.\n(\n2025\n)\n,\nrobotic tasks often entail substantial distributional shifts and evolving conditions across both visual and linguistic modalities\nPong\net al.\n(\n2020\n); Wang\net al.\n(\n2025a\n); Kim\net al.\n(\n2024\n); Liu\net al.\n(\n2024a\n)\n. Consequently,\nfixed, protocol-driven self-supervised objectives become inadequate (see §\n4.5\n) and overly generic.\nRecent work has explored reinforcement-based alternatives to the purely self-supervised test-time training objectives. In particular, EVOLVE-VLA\nBai\net al.\n(\n2025b\n)\nleverages task progress as a reward signal to optimize VLA policies during deployment. However, its reliance on GRPO-style optimization incurs substantial computational overhead, limiting its applicability to real-time robotic settings with strict latency constraints. We provide a more detailed discussion regarding the use of GRPO for TTT in VLAs in Appendix §\nS7\n.\nTo address these limitations, we propose an RL-driven test-time learning framework that enables efficient online adaptation (see §\n3\n).\n3\nMethod\nIn this section, we introduce\nT\nest-\nT\nime Reinforcement Learning framework for\nVLA\n(TT-VLA), a novel\ntest-time training approach designed to enhance VLA performance through on-the-fly policy adaptation.\nIn §\n3.1\n, we first\nprovide background on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and VLAs. We then present TT-VLA in §\n3.2\n.\n§\n3.3\nfurther provides TT-VLA’s theoretical analysis and insights. The overall framework is shown in Fig.\n2\n.\n3.1\nPreliminaries\nProblem Formulation.\nWe model robotic manipulation as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP)\nKaelbling\net al.\n(\n1998\n)\n, defined as:\nℳ\n=\n(\n𝒮\n,\n𝒜\n,\n𝒪\n,\nℒ\n)\n,\n\\mathcal{M}=(\\mathcal{S},\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{O},\\mathcal{L}),\n(1)\nwhere\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\ndenotes the state space of the robot and environment,\n𝒜\n\\mathcal{A}\nis the action space,\n𝒪\n\\mathcal{O}\nrepresents the multimodal observation space (\ne.g\n.\n, RGB and proprioception), and\nℒ\n\\mathcal{L}\ndenotes the space of natural-language task instructions.\nAt the start of a task episode, the VLA policy\nπ\nθ\n\\pi_{\\theta}\nreceives an instruction\nl\n∈\nℒ\nl\\in\\mathcal{L}\nand an initial observation\no\n0\no_{0}\n.\nThe goal of the VLA policy\nπ\nθ\n\\pi_{\\theta}\nis to generate a sequence of actions:\na\n0\n:\nT\n−\n1\n∼\nπ\nθ\n​\n(\na\nt\n∣\no\nt\n−\nH\n+\n1\n:\nt\n,\nl\n)\n,\na_{0:T-1}\\sim\\pi_{\\theta}(a_{t}\\mid o_{t-H+1:t},l),\n(2)\nwhere\no\nt\no_{t}\nand\na\nt\na_{t}\ndenote the observation and action at time\nt\nt\n,\nT\nT\nis the episode length, and\nH\nH\nis the number of past observations used as policy input.\nThe above formulation characterizes the standard VLA decision process. However, it inherently assumes a fixed, pre-trained policy. Real-world deployments, on the other hand, demand adaptability to dynamic environments.\nTherefore, under the test-time adaptation, our goal should now switch to adjusting the pretrained policy\nπ\nθ\n\\pi_{\\theta}\nonline during deployment flexibly\nwithout\nany access to training data, environment resets, or human intervention.\nProximal Policy Optimization (PPO)\n.\nPPO is an actor–critic policy-gradient method that uses a clipped surrogate objective to constrain policy updates, ensuring stable optimization by keeping the updated policy within a trust region of the previous policy. Formally, the PPO objective is defined as:\nL\nPPO\n​\n(\nθ\n)\n=\n𝔼\nt\n​\n[\nL\nt\nCLIP\n​\n(\nθ\n)\n−\nc\n1\n​\nL\nt\nValue\n​\n(\nθ\n)\n+\nc\n2\n​\nL\nt\nentropy\n​\n(\nθ\n)\n]\n,\nL^{\\text{PPO}}(\\theta)=\\mathbb{E}_{t}\\left[L^{\\text{CLIP}}_{t}(\\theta)-c_{1}L^{\\text{Value}}_{t}(\\theta)+c_{2}L^{\\text{entropy}}_{t}(\\theta)\\right],\n(3)\nwhere\nL\nt\nCLIP\n​\n(\nθ\n)\nL_{t}^{\\text{CLIP}}(\\theta)\nrepresents the clipped policy loss,\nL\nt\nValue\n​\n(\nθ\n)\nL_{t}^{\\text{Value}}(\\theta)\ndenotes the value function loss,\nL\nt\nEntropy\n​\n(\nθ\n)\nL_{t}^{\\text{Entropy}}(\\theta)\nis the entropy regularization term, and\nc\n1\nc_{1}\nand\nc\n2\nc_{2}\nare weighting coefficients.\nThe clipped policy objective is defined as:\nL\nt\nCLIP\n​\n(\nθ\n)\n=\n𝔼\nt\n​\n[\nmin\n⁡\n(\nr\nt\n​\n(\nθ\n)\n​\nA\n^\nt\n,\nclip\n​\n(\nr\nt\n​\n(\nθ\n)\n,\n1\n−\nϵ\n,\n1\n+\nϵ\n)\n​\nA\n^\nt\n)\n]\n,\nL^{\\text{CLIP}}_{t}(\\theta)=\\mathbb{E}_{t}\\left[\\min\\!\\left(r_{t}(\\theta)\\hat{A}_{t},\\,\\text{clip}\\!\\big(r_{t}(\\theta),1-\\epsilon,1+\\epsilon\\big)\\hat{A}_{t}\\right)\\right],\n(4)\nwhere\nr\nt\n​\n(\nθ\n)\n=\nπ\nθ\n​\n(\na\nt\n∣\ns\nt\n)\nπ\nθ\nold\n​\n(\na\nt\n∣\ns\nt\n)\nr_{t}(\\theta)=\\frac{\\pi_{\\theta}(a_{t}\\mid s_{t})}{\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(a_{t}\\mid s_{t})}\nis the ratio between the new and old policy,\nϵ\n\\epsilon\ncontrols the clipping range,\nA\n^\nt\n\\hat{A}_{t}\ndenotes the advantage estimate, and\nclip\n​\n(\n⋅\n)\n\\text{clip}(\\cdot)\ndenotes the clipping operation.\nPPO typically employs Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) to estimate\nA\n^\nt\n\\hat{A}_{t}\n,\ngiven by:\nA\n^\nt\n=\n∑\nl\n=\n0\n∞\n(\nγ\n​\nλ\n)\nl\n​\nδ\nt\n+\nl\n,\n\\hat{A}_{t}=\\sum_{l=0}^{\\infty}(\\gamma\\lambda)^{l}\\,\\delta_{t+l},\n(5)\nwhere\nδ\nt\n=\nr\nt\n+\nγ\n​\nV\n​\n(\ns\nt\n+\n1\n)\n−\nV\n​\n(\ns\nt\n)\n\\delta_{t}=r_{t}+\\gamma V(s_{t+1})-V(s_{t})\nis temporal-difference (TD) residual,\nγ\n\\gamma\nis the discount factor,\nλ\n\\lambda\nis the smoothing parameter, and\nV\n​\n(\ns\nt\n)\nV(s_{t})\nis\nthe estimated expected return from state\ns\nt\ns_{t}\n.\n3.2\nTT-VLA\nIn PPO, both the policy\nπ\nθ\n\\pi_{\\theta}\nand value function\nV\nθ\nV_{\\theta}\nare trained jointly. However, in VLA test-time adaptation,\nlearning a reliable value function is generally infeasible due to two reasons:\n①\nLimited samples\n: Test-time adaptation relies on extremely limited interaction data, a single episode, which is insufficient for accurate return estimation.\n②\nStrict time constraints\n: Test-time updates for VLA models must be performed online under strict latency constraints. To overcome these limitations, we develop a value-free PPO, which enables policy adaptation\nwithout\nan explicit value function.\nFigure 2:\nOverview of TT-VLA.\n(a) Overall pipeline.\nIn TT-VLA, a pretrained VLA policy receives an observation and instruction, executes actions in the environment, and receives dense, progress-based rewards computed by a progress estimator. These rewards are used to update the policy online via a value-free PPO objective, enabling continuous within-episode policy adaptation at test time (see §\n3.2\n).\n(b) Effectiveness.\nTT-VLA consistently improves the performance of diverse VLA backbones across unseen tasks, demonstrating robust generalization and adaptability under evolving conditions or distributional shifts (see §\n4.2\n-\n4.3\n).\nDense Progress-Based Reward.\nMost existing RL-based VLAs\nLi\net al.\n(\n2025a\n); Liu\net al.\n(\n2025a\n)\nrely on sparse terminal rewards, typically indicating binary task success or failure at the end of an episode. While such rewards are effective during offline training, where episodes can be replayed or reset, they are impractical for test-time adaptation:\nthe policy updates are delayed until task completion, preventing any mid-episode correction or online adjustment.\nConsequently, a robot operating with sparse rewards cannot refine its behavior during inference, leading to fragile and non-adaptive performance in dynamic environments.\nLet\np\nt\n∈\n[\n0\n,\n1\n]\np_{t}\\in[0,1]\ndenote task progress at time step\nt\nt\n. Intuitively,\np\nt\np_{t}\nshould increase when actions advance task completion\nand decrease when actions undo or reverse previously achieved progress. In a POMDP setting, we estimate progress directly from observations and language instructions as:\np\nt\n=\nΦ\n​\n(\no\n0\n:\nt\n+\n1\n,\nl\n)\n,\np_{t}=\\Phi(o_{0:t+1},l),\n(6)\nwhere\nΦ\n\\Phi\ndenotes a task progress predictor conditioned on the observation history and instruction\nl\nl\n. The per-step dense reward is then defined as the temporal difference in progress:\nr\nt\n=\np\nt\n−\np\nt\n−\n1\n.\nr_{t}=p_{t}-p_{t-1}.\n(7)\nWe instantiate\nΦ\n\\Phi\nusing the Vision-Language-Action-Critic model (VLAC)\nZhai\net al.\n(\n2025\n)\n, a pretrained multimodal model that serves as a scalar regressor for task progress estimation.\nThis progress-based reward exhibits three desirable properties. First, it requires no external supervision during inference, allowing fully autonomous adaptation at test time.\nSecond, it provides dense, step-wise feedback that facilitates continuous mid-episodic policy adaptation. Third, it encourages monotonic progress toward task completion while discouraging oscillatory or regressive behaviors.\nTraining Objective.\nUnder the test-time VLA setting, learning an accurate value function\nV\nθ\nV_{\\theta}\nwithin a single episode is impractical.\nWe therefore adopt a value-free PPO variant that removes the value function learning and directly uses the per-step reward signal from Eq.\n7\nfor policy adaptation.\nStarting from Eq.\n3\n,\nwe remove auxiliary losses by setting\nc\n1\n=\n0\nc_{1}=0\nand\nc\n2\n=\n0\nc_{2}=0\n, discarding both value regression and entropy regularization term.\nWhile the entropy term encourages exploration during training, test-time adaptation prioritizes rapid fitting of the current task rather than broad exploration. As a result, our objective focuses solely on stable policy refinement, while preserving the clipped surrogate loss. Eq.\n3\nnow turns into:\nL\n​\n(\nθ\n)\n=\n𝔼\nt\n​\n[\nL\nt\nCLIP\n​\n(\nθ\n)\n]\n.\nL(\\theta)=\\mathbb{E}_{t}\\left[L^{\\text{CLIP}}_{t}(\\theta)\\right].\n(8)\nTo make the agent precisely capture the immediate value of the current action, we further redefine the advantage to depend only on the reward obtained from that action, rather than the exponentially weighted combination of TD residuals used in GAE (see Eq.\n5\n). In other words, we focus on how each individual action contributes to instantaneous progress rather than estimating long-term returns. To achieve this, we set\nλ\n=\n0\n\\lambda=0\nand\nγ\n=\n0\n\\gamma=0\n, collapsing GAE into a one-step formulation:\nA\n^\nt\n=\nδ\nt\n=\nr\nt\n.\n\\hat{A}_{t}=\\delta_{t}=r_{t}.\n(9)\nHere,\nδ\nt\n=\nr\nt\n\\delta_{t}=r_{t}\nsince we remove the value function, making the TD residual the immediate reward signal.\nThis simplification ensures that policy updates directly reflect the progress at each step, allowing the agent to adapt rapidly to changing conditions without relying on a value function.\nOverall Pipeline.\nAt the beginning of each episode, the pretrained VLA receives an initial observation\no\n0\no_{0}\nand instruction\nl\nl\n. The VLA policy\nπ\nθ\n\\pi_{\\theta}\ngenerates the first action\na\n0\na_{0}\n. At each subsequent time step\nt\nt\n, the VLA receives the latest observation\no\nt\no_{t}\nand outputs an action\na\nt\na_{t}\n. After execution, the progress estimator\nΦ\n\\Phi\ncomputes the task progress\np\nt\np_{t}\n, and the corresponding dense reward\nr\nt\nr_{t}\n(see Eq.\n7\n). This reward is used to compute the policy loss via Eq.\n8\nin a value-free manner, and the policy parameters\nθ\n\\theta\nare updated accordingly.\nThe updated policy\nπ\nθ\n′\n\\pi_{\\theta^{\\prime}}\nis then used to generate subsequent actions, allowing continuous refinement throughout the episode.\nThe pseudo code is shown in Appendix Algorithm\n1\n.\n3.3\nTheoretical Analysis of TT-VLA\nIn §\n3.2\n, we proposed TT-VLA using a progress-based dense reward and a value-free formulation for test-time adaptation. In this section, we provide a theoretical justification for these design choices.\nProposition 1\n(Vanishing learning signal under progress-difference reward)\n.\nLet the per-step reward be defined as the progress difference\nr\nt\n=\np\nt\n−\np\nt\n−\n1\nr_{t}=p_{t}-p_{t-1}\nwith\np\nt\n∈\n[\n0\n,\n1\n]\np_{t}\\in[0,1]\n.\nAssume that the value function represents the remaining progress,\nV\n​\n(\ns\nt\n)\n=\n1\n−\np\nt\n−\n1\nV(s_{t})=1-p_{t-1}\n, and the discount factor is\nγ\n=\n1\n\\gamma=1\n.\nThen the temporal-difference (TD) error vanishes for all\nt\nt\n, and consequently\nthe GAE\nA\n^\nt\n\\hat{A}_{t}\nis identically zero:\nδ\nt\n=\n0\n,\nA\n^\nt\n=\n0\n,\n∀\nλ\n∈\n[\n0\n,\n1\n]\n.\n\\delta_{t}=0,\\quad\\hat{A}_{t}=0,\\qquad\\forall\\lambda\\in[0,1].\n(10)\nProof.\nSubstituting\nr\nt\n=\np\nt\n−\np\nt\n−\n1\nr_{t}=p_{t}-p_{t-1}\n,\nV\n​\n(\ns\nt\n)\n=\n1\n−\np\nt\n−\n1\nV(s_{t})=1-p_{t-1}\n, and\nγ\n=\n1\n\\gamma=1\ninto the TD residual yields\nδ\nt\n=\nr\nt\n+\nγ\n​\nV\n​\n(\ns\nt\n+\n1\n)\n−\nV\n​\n(\ns\nt\n)\n=\n(\np\nt\n−\np\nt\n−\n1\n)\n+\n(\n1\n−\np\nt\n)\n−\n(\n1\n−\np\nt\n−\n1\n)\n=\n0\n.\n\\begin{aligned} \\delta_{t}&=r_{t}+\\gamma V(s_{t+1})-V(s_{t})\\\\\n&=(p_{t}-p_{t-1})+(1-p_{t})-(1-p_{t-1})\\\\\n&=0.\\end{aligned}\n(11)\nBy Eq.\n5\n, GAE is a weighted sum of TD residuals, it follows that\nA\n^\nt\n=\n0\n\\hat{A}_{t}=0\n.

As shown in the table, across all baselines and task categories, TT-VLA consistently improves performance during test time, demonstrating substantial generalizability and constituting a novel angle for VLA adaptivity.\n4.1\nExperimental Setup\nEnvironment and Task Settings.\nAs stated in §\n2.1\n,\nTT-VLA aims to address the inherent vulnerability of current VLAs to unanticipated dynamics and domain shifts.\nTo evaluate this generalization capability on\nunseen tasks\n, we test TT-VLA on both simulated and real-world tasks.\nFor\nsimulation experiments\n(see §\n4.2\n),\nwe follow RL4VLA’s\nLiu\net al.\n(\n2025a\n)\nsetup, focusing on a standard pick-and-place manipulation scenario. The agent receives an RGB observation and a natural-language instruction, and outputs a Cartesian end-effector delta along with a binary gripper command.\nSpecifically, as in\nLiu\net al.\n(\n2025a\n)\n, we evaluate generalization along three dimensions:\nExecution\n,\nVision\n, and\nSemantics\n.\nFor\nExecution\n, the initial poses of the robot, object, and receptacle are randomized, and an additional mid-episode object repositioning condition is introduced to evaluate robustness to dynamic variations during execution.\nFor\nVision\n, both foreground and background appearances are varied through dynamic textures, unseen table surfaces, and image-level noise.\nFor\nSemantics\n, unseen objects, receptacles, and instruction paraphrases are introduced, along with multi-object, multi-receptacle, and distractor-receptacle tasks designed to assess compositional and linguistic generalization. Detailed task specifications are provided in Appendix §\nS3\n.\nAll simulation experiments are conducted in ManiSkill 3\nTao\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\nusing a WidowX-250S robotic arm.\nFor\nreal-world evaluation\n(see §\n4.3\n),\nwe study pick-and-place manipulation tasks on a Franka Research 3 platform. The agent similarly receives an RGB image and a task instruction, and outputs a Cartesian end-effector displacement together with a binary gripper command. We evaluate performance on nine unseen tasks designed to assess robustness to executional, visual, and semantic shifts.\nImplementation Details.\nFor simulation, each task is executed for 80 trials across three random seeds using a\n640\n×\n480\n640\\times 480\nRGB image as input.\nFor real-world experiments, each task is evaluated over 10 trials under consistent experimental conditions, including fixed camera viewpoints with an image resolution of\n500\n×\n480\n500\\times 480\n, controlled lighting, and static backgrounds.\nThe policy is fine-tuned using LoRA\nHu\net al.\n(\n2022\n)\nwith ranks\n{\n16\n,\n32\n}\n\\{16,32\\}\n. Learning rates are chosen from\n{\n1\n×\n10\n−\n5\n,\n5\n×\n10\n−\n5\n,\n1\n×\n10\n−\n4\n}\n\\{1\\times 10^{-5},5\\times 10^{-5},1\\times 10^{-4}\\}\n, optimized with AdamW. A clip parameter\nϵ\n\\epsilon\nof 0.2 is applied to enhance training stability.\nEach episode is executed with a fixed horizon of 160 steps.\n4.2\nSimulation Results\nBaselines.\nWe benchmark our proposed method against several state-of-the-art open-source VLA models, which span diverse architectural designs and training paradigms:\n•\nNora\nHung\net al.\n(\n2025\n)\nadopts Qwen-2.5-VL-3B\nBai\net al.\n(\n2025a\n)\nas its backbone and employs the FAST+ tokenizer\nPertsch\net al.\n(\n2025\n)\nto enable efficient action sequence generation. Following\nLiu\net al.\n(\n2025a\n)\nto ensure a strong initial policy, we further fine-tune Nora for 50k steps on a self-collected ManiSkill 3 dataset.\n•\nOpenVLA\nKim\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\nis one of the most widely used open-source VLA models. It is built on Llama-2-7B\nTouvron\net al.\n(\n2023\n)\n. Consistent with\nLiu\net al.\n(\n2025a\n)\n, we apply a warm-up fine-tuning phase of 10k steps prior to evaluation.\n•\nOpenVLA-RL\nLiu\net al.\n(\n2025a\n)\nextends OpenVLA via reinforcement learning during training, enabling further task-specific policy refinement beyond supervised pre-training.\n•\nTraceVLA\nZheng\net al.\n(\n2025\n)\nis designed to enhance spatio-temporal reasoning through visual trace prompting. By encoding state–action histories as visual prompts, it better captures long-horizon dependencies and improves manipulation performance in interactive environments.\nOverall Performance.\nAs shown in Table\n1\n, our proposed method\nconsistently improves\nthe performance of\nall\nrepresentative baseline models across a range of unseen tasks, demonstrating its broad applicability. For example, when applied to Nora, our method achieves gains on\n14 out of 15\ntasks, with relative improvements ranging from\n5.26% to 44.4%\n. The largest improvements are observed on Task Obj. Rep. (\n44.4\n%\n44.4\\%\n) and Task Noise-s (\n18.15\n%\n18.15\\%\n). Similarly, on OpenVLA, our method yields consistent performance improvements across nearly all tasks, including several large-margin gains (\ne.g\n.\n, 44.9% on Task Disturb Recep. and 18.4% on Task Obj. Rep.).\nOverall, while current methods generally focus on training-time sophisticated architectural improvements, we demonstrate that substantial generalizability across diverse baselines and unseen tasks can be achieved through a markedly more streamlined yet robust test-time adjustment. Given its capacity for dynamic adjustment based on unseen samples, our approach constitutes a significantly novel solution for VLA adaptivity\nKachaev\net al.\n(\n2025\n); Liu\net al.\n(\n2025a\n)\n.\nFigure 3:\nReal-world setup and evaluation.\nWe evaluate nine real-world pick-and-place tasks covering\nExecution\n,\nVision\n, and\nSemantics\ngeneralization, with three tasks per category. The results show that TT-VLA consistently improves performance over baseline VLA models in real-world settings.\n4.3\nReal-World Results\nWe use OpenVLA as the base policy, and evaluate TT-VLA on nine unseen real-world tasks (see Fig.\n3\n).\nAs seen, our method consistently improves performance over OpenVLA in real-world settings, demonstrating effective generalization beyond simulation and highlighting the practicality of test-time adaptation in real robotic deployments.\nWe further report\na representative case study “put banana on plate” in Fig.\n5\n, where the robot grasps the banana and moves it toward the plate. During the original execution, the gripper temporarily deviates from\nthe target region and moves away from the plate, signifying a substantial risk of task failure.\nHowever, by leveraging the dense, progress-based reward of TT-VLA, the policy enables rapid detection of task regression and on-the-fly behavioral adjustments.\nThe immediate reward feedback allows the VLA policy to correct deviations and realign with the task objective, ultimately completing the placement successfully.\nThis example highlights the advantage of instantaneous, progress-aware rewards in enabling rapid recovery from execution errors.\nMore real-world qualitative examples are shown in Appendix §\nS6\n.\nFigure 4:\nImpact of reward design\n.\nThe results show that our progress-based reward consistently outperforms the standard GAE across tasks and models.\nLearning\nExecution\nVision\nSemantics\nStep\nNora\nOpenVLA\nNora\nOpenVLA\nNora\nOpenVLA\n1\n10.83%\n40.42%\n40.00%\n54.12%\n15.42%\n43.33%\n4\n11.25%\n41.25%\n42.08%\n56.25%\n17.50%\n46.25%\n8\n12.50%\n42.08%\n44.58%\n57.08%\n18.33%\n46.25%\n16\n11.25%\n42.08%\n43.33%\n55.42%\n17.50%\n45.42%\nTable 2:\nImpact of learning step\n. An update interval of 8 steps yield the best performance.\n4.4\nDiagnostic Experiments\nWe conduct an ablation study on both Nora and OpenVLA using three representative unseen tasks.\nReward/Advantage Design.\nWe first analyze the effect of discounting in GAE (see Eq.\n5\n).\nSpecifically, we compare the standard GAE setting with nonzero discount factor and trace parameter (\ne.g\n.\n,\nγ\n>\n0\n\\gamma>0\n,\nλ\n>\n0\n\\lambda>0\n) against our variant in which both\nγ\n\\gamma\nand\nλ\n\\lambda\nare set to zero.\nBy eliminating discounting and trace accumulation, TT-VLA emphasizes how each individual action contributes to immediate progress rather than estimating long-term returns.\nEmpirically, focusing on immediate progress yields consistent improvements in performance. For example, as shown in Fig.\n4\n, on the\nVision\ntask with OpenVLA, our setting achieves a success rate of 57.08%, compared to 55.00% when using standard GAE. We attribute this performance gain to the fact that long-horizon returns can be unreliable in this setting, occasionally assigning overly optimistic advantage signals to ineffective actions. These results suggest that instantaneous feedback can be more effective than incorporating discounted future rewards during test time.\nTest-Time Training Steps.\nWe then explore the impact of model update frequency in TT-VLA by varying the update interval over different environment steps (\ni.e\n.\n, 1, 4, 8, and 16). The number of learning steps is designed to balance the trade-off between rapid adaptation to newly collected data and the overall stability of the optimization process. Table\n2\nshows that updating the model every 8 steps yields the best performance. More frequent updates (\ne.g\n.\n, 1 step)\ncan destabilize training and limit the effectiveness of each update. In contrast, less frequent updates (\ne.g\n.\n, 16 steps) delay policy improvement and reduce learning efficiency. These findings suggest that an intermediate update frequency achieves a balance between rapid policy adaptation and stable optimization. Additional details are provided in Appendix §\nS4\n.\nFigure 5:\nReal-world case study\nillustrates how TT-VLA’s instantaneous reward feedback enables rapid recovery from trajectory errors during deployment.\n4.5\nDiscussions on VLA Test-Time Training\nAs stated in §\n2.2\n, TTT was originally proposed for LLMs.\nA natural question is:\nCan test-time training methods in LLMs be directly applied to VLA models?\nTo address this question, we examine two representative approaches for VLAs: a self-supervised test-time training method, TLM\nHu\net al.\n(\n2025\n)\n, and a test-time reinforcement learning method, TTRL\nHu\net al.\n(\n2025\n)\n. Unless otherwise specified, we follow the same experimental setup as the diagnostic experiments, using the same tasks and baseline models for evaluation.\nWe first consider TLM\nHu\net al.\n(\n2025\n)\nthat enables test-time adaptation by directly minimizing input perplexity without any external supervision.\nWhen applied to VLAs, TLM updates model parameters by optimizing the likelihood of test-time observation sequences.\nAs shown in Table\n3\n, this strategy results in lower performance gains than TT-VLA.\nThe reason is that,\nunlike pure language tasks, VLA tasks involve complex interactions between perceptions, instruction understanding, and actions. Updates driven solely by input likelihood may overly emphasize representational consistency rather than task-oriented decision making. As a result,\nself-supervised test-time objectives cannot readily translate to the VLA domain.\nWe further compare TT-VLA with TTRL\nHu\net al.\n(\n2025\n)\n, a recently proposed test-time reinforcement learning approach. TTRL performs test-time adaptation by sampling multiple candidate outputs for each input and constructing a consensus pseudo-label via majority voting\nShao\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\n. This pseudo-label is then used to construct rule-based rewards, where outputs that match/mismatch the pseudo-label receive positive/zero rewards.\nAs reported in Table\n3\n, TTRL underperforms our proposed TT-VLA,\nindicating that the consensus-based pseudo-label is less effective for VLA tasks.\nOne possible reason is that\nmajority voting does not reflect action quality, and reward signals derived from output agreement fail to provide\ntask-aligned learning signals, thereby limiting the effectiveness of VLA test-time updates. More details of TLM and TTRL are provided in Appendix §\nS5\n.\nExecution\nVision\nSemantics\nModel\nNora\nOpenVLA\nNora\nOpenVLA\nNora\nOpenVLA\nTLM\n11.25%\n40.42%\n41.25%\n52.50%\n16.67%\n42.9%\nTTRL\n10.42%\n40.83%\n39.58%\n51.42%\n16.25%\n41.76%\nOurs\n12.50%\n42.08%\n44.58%\n57.08%\n18.33%\n46.25%\nTable 3:\nComparison of TTT methods\n. We compare TT-VLA with TLM and TTRL (see §\n4.5\n). As seen, TT-VLA achieves superior performance, highlighting the importance of progress-based reward for effective test-test adaptation in VLAs.\n5\nConclusion\nWhile VLA models have gained significant popularity on closed-form benchmarks, this work focuses on the flexibility of applying these models in evolving environments via test-time reinforcement learning.\nExperimental results demonstrate that TT-VLA consistently enhances performance on unseen tasks across diverse simulated and real-world scenarios, as well as across various VLA backbones.\nWe believe that our framework provides pioneering and foundational contributions to VLA models to flexibly refine action policies\nunder dynamic, previously unseen test-time cases.\nAcknowledgments\nThe views and conclusions contained herein are those of the authors and should not be interpreted as necessarily representing the official policies or endorsements, either expressed or implied, of the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) or the U.S. Government.\nReferences\nA.

They generally achieve action planning via two main branches: I. Discretization-based approaches\nKim\net al.\n(\n2024\n); Brohan\net al.\n(\n2023\n); Zitkovich\net al.\n(\n2023\n)\n, which discretize the action space into a small set of action tokens; and II. Diffusion-based approaches\nChi\net al.\n(\n2023\n); Xian and Gkanatsios (\n2023\n); Janner\net al.\n(\n2022\n); Liang\net al.\n(\n2023\n); Ajay\net al.\n(\n2023\n)\n, which integrate diffusion heads for action prediction.\nIn our study, we focus on and generalize discretization-based approaches. The reason is that most diffusion-head VLA models adopt a separate action decoder, typically a latent diffusion process that maps visual and instruction embeddings to an action embedding stream, followed by a shallow MLP to regress the robot’s joint space\nWen\net al.\n(\n2025b\n)\n. This design renders reinforcement-learning (RL) optimization impractical (\ni.e\n.\n, also for diffusion large language model (DLLM) RL optimization\nWang\net al.\n(\n2025c\n)\n) for three technical reasons:\n(i) the resulting policy is implicit and does not expose a tractable per-step log-likelihood (\nlog\n⁡\nπ\nθ\n​\n(\na\n∣\ns\n)\n\\log\\pi_{\\theta}(a\\mid s)\n), precluding policy-gradient methods (\ne.g\n.\n, REINFORCE\nSutton\net al.\n(\n1999b\n)\n/PPO\nSchulman\net al.\n(\n2017\n)\n) and entropy regularization;\n(ii) action emission requires tens of denoising iterations per control step, creating an inner stochastic chain misaligned with environment time, which breaks step-wise credit assignment; and\n(iii) the diffusion noise-prediction objective is mismatched with return-based RL objectives, while the terminal MLP head is effectively deterministic, suppressing exploration.\nHowever, we notice a very recent paper dVLA\nWen\net al.\n(\n2025a\n)\ndecodes actions as a discrete, autoregressive token sequence conditioned on state/instruction, making the current RL attempts possible to apply to diffusion-based approaches. While the code is not publicly available for us to evaluate, we highlight that our method can be naturally applied to this line of research.\nS1.2\nRL Methods for VLA\nAs we mentioned in our study, recently, some efforts have attempted to apply RL to the VLA training stage, leaving the test-time adjustments underexplored. In light of this view, we aim to fill the last puzzle of on-the-fly policy adaptation. We list some research with high impact on the integration of RL on VLAs.\nGRAPE\nZhang\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\nuses Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)\nRafailov\net al.\n(\n2023\n)\nto train VLAs by integrating human preferences.

However, we should notice that EVOLVE-VLA optimizes the policy using GRPO, which incurs substantial computational overhead and is therefore less suitable for real-time robotic deployment. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced in real-world robotic settings, where strict latency constraints are critical.\nAppendix S2\nLemma Proof\nIn this section, we provide the proof of Lemma\n1\n, which characterizes the relationship between GAE and the reward-only advantage used in TT-VLA. This result formally justifies our value-free test-time optimization objective.\nProof.\n(i) For (a): When\nλ\n=\n0\n\\lambda=0\n, the geometric weighting term\n(\nγ\n​\nλ\n)\nl\n(\\gamma\\lambda)^{l}\nvanishes for all\nl\n>\n0\nl>0\n, Utilizing (14), it yields\nA\nt\n=\nδ\nt\nA_{t}=\\delta_{t}\n.\n(ii) For (b): When\nγ\n=\n0\n\\gamma=0\n, (14) and (15) respectively yields\nA\nt\n=\nδ\nt\n,\nδ\nt\n=\nr\nt\n−\nV\n​\n(\ns\nt\n)\n,\nA_{t}=\\delta_{t},\\;\\delta_{t}=r_{t}-V(s_{t}),\n(16)\n(16) implies that when\nV\n​\n(\ns\n)\n≡\n0\nV(s)\\equiv 0\n, there holds\nA\nt\n=\nδ\nt\n=\nr\nt\n,\nA_{t}=\\delta_{t}=r_{t},\n(17)\nwhich completes the proof.\n∎\nAppendix S3\nTask Details\nFor simulation tasks, we follow\nLiu\net al.\n(\n2025a\n)\nto define three dimensions of generalization problems for unseen tasks, which are\nExecution\n,\nVision\n, and\nSemantics\n.\nThe training task setting: At the beginning of each episode, an object is sampled from the 16 training objects and a table appearance is sampled from the 16 training textures. The object and the receptacle (yellow plate) are placed on the table, with their positions uniformly randomized within a rectangular region. The language instruction follows the template “put\nO\nO\non\nR\nR\n”, where\nO\nO\nand\nR\nR\ndenote the object and receptacle names, respectively.\nExecution\nexplores changes in the initial positions of both the object, the receptacle, the robot initial pose, and mid-episode changes in the object’s position during task execution.\n•\nUnseen Object & Receptacle Position (Obj. Pos.): The object and the receptacle are placed on the table, with their positions randomized within a larger square region that surrounds the original rectangular area. All other settings follow the Training setting.\n•\nUnseen Robot Init Pose (Robot Pose): At the start of each episode, the initial poses of all robots are randomized instead of being fixed as in the Training setting. All other settings remain identical to the Training setting.\n•\nMid-Episode Object Reposition (Obj. Rep.): At the fifth timestep of each episode, the object is teleported to a new randomly sampled position on the table. All other settings remain identical to the Training setting.\nVision\nincludes both foreground and background changes, as well as image-level Dynamic Noise, applied with either weak or strong intensity.\n•\nUnseen Table (Table): The table appearance is sampled from 5 unseen appearance.\n•\nWeak Dynamic Texture (Texture-w): In addition to sampling an object and a table appearance, a texture is selected from the 16 available textures at the start of each episode. This texture is cropped and resized at each timestep differently, and overlaid onto the object, receptacle, and robot arm with a transparency factor of 0.3.\n•\nStrong Dynamic Texture (Texture-s): The settings matches the Weak Dynamic Texture setting, except that the image mixing transparency is increased to 0.5.\n•\nWeak Dynamic Noise (Noise-w): In addition to sampling an object and a table appearance, a texture is selected from the 16 available textures at the start of each episode. The texture is cropped and resized at each timestep differently and overlaid over the entire image with a transparency factor of 0.3.\n•\nStrong Dynamic Noise (Noise-s): The settings matches the Weak Dynamic Noise setting, except that the image mixing transparency is increased to 0.5\nSemantics\nconsiders previously unseen variations in Objects, Receptacles, and Instruction Phrasings.\n•\nUnseen Objects (Object): The object is sampled from 9 unseen objects, while all other settings follow the Training setting.\n•\nUnseen Receptacles (Recep.): In addition to sampling an object and a table appearance, a receptacle is selected from 16 unseen receptacles at the start of each episode, replacing the default training receptacle (yellow plate). All other settings follow the Training setting\n•\nUnseen Instruction Phrasing (Instruct): In addition to sampling an object and a table appearance, a language instruction template is selected from 16 unseen templates (Same as\nLiu\net al.\n(\n2025a\n)\n) at the start of each episode, replacing the default instruction (“put\nO\nO\non\nR\nR\n”). All other settings follow the Training setting.\n•\nSeen Multi-Object (M-Obj. (IND)): At the beginning of each episode, two distinct objects are sampled from the 16 training objects along with one of the 16 training table appearances. Both objects and the receptacle (yellow plate) are placed on the table, with their positions randomly initialized within a rectangular region.\n•\nUnseen Multi-Object (M-Obj. (OOD)): Two distinct objects are sampled from the nine unseen objects, with all other settings identical to the Seen Multi-Object settings.\n•\nDistractive Receptacle (Dist Recep.): In addition to sampling an object and a table appearance, a distractor receptacle is selected from 16 unseen receptacles at the start of each episode and placed on the table without being used in the task. All other settings follow the Training setting.\n•\nMulti-Receptacle (M Recep.): At the beginning of each episode, an object is sampled from the 16 training objects, two distinct receptacles are sampled from the 16 unseen receptacles, and a table appearance is selected from the 16 training textures. The object and both receptacles are placed on the table, with their positions randomly initialized within a rectangular region.\nFor real-world evaluation, we assess our method on nine unseen manipulation tasks designed to test generalization across execution, vision, and semantic dimensions. The execution tasks consist of are “put banana on plate”, “put lemon on plate”, “put apple on plate” under different initial robot configurations, evaluating robustness to variations in starting states. The vision tasks use the same instructions but introduce different background appearances to assess visual generalization. The semantic tasks also follow the same instruction templates but involve an unseen plate at test time, evaluating the model’s ability to generalize to novel semantic contexts. The nine tasks are illustrated in Fig.\n3\n.\nAppendix S4\nAdditional Details on Diagnostic Experiments\nThis section provides additional implementation details for the diagnostic experiments discussed in §\n4.4\n. We conduct diagnostic experiments using Nora and OpenVLA. We evaluate one task from each dimension:\nexecution\n,\nvision\n, and\nsemantics\n. Specifically, we use Task Robot Pose (\nexecution\n), Task Table (\nvision\n), and Task Object (\nsemantics\n) for all ablations to ensure controlled and comparable evaluations across settings.\nFor Advantage Design, the standard GAE baseline uses a discount factor of\nγ\n=\n0.99\n\\gamma=0.99\nand a trace parameter of\nλ\n=\n0.95\n\\lambda=0.95\n, with a truncated horizon length of\nl\n=\n8\nl=8\nfor advantage estimation. In contrast, our method disables both discounting and trace accumulation by setting\nγ\n=\n0\n\\gamma=0\nand\nλ\n=\n0\n\\lambda=0\n, yielding a one-step, reward-only advantage.\nAppendix S5\nAdditional Details on Test-Time Training Discussions\nThis section provides implementation details for adapting TLM and TTRL to VLA models.\nFor TLM, we follow the original formulation and perform test-time adaptation by minimizing the perplexity of the instruction prompt. Concretely, given a task instruction, we optimize the model parameters to reduce the negative log-likelihood of the instruction tokens, without relying on external supervision or environment rewards. We set the loss weighting coefficient to\nλ\n=\n0.1\n\\lambda=0.1\nand use a threshold value of\n0\nfor triggering updates. The policy is updated every 8 environment steps. We apply LoRA to update the policy, using a rank of 32 and a learning rate of\n1\n×\n10\n−\n4\n1\\times 10^{-4}\n.\nFor TTRL, we adapt the consensus-based test-time reinforcement learning framework to the VLA setting. At each decision step, we sample multiple candidate action tokens from the model to construct a pseudo-label via majority voting. We set the voting group size to 8. The reward function is defined as a binary signal: a reward of 1 is assigned if the sampled action token matches the pseudo-label, and 0 otherwise. Policy updates are performed at every environment step to accommodate the step-wise nature of action execution in real-time settings. We employ LoRA to update the policy parameters, with a rank of 32 and a learning rate of\n1\n×\n10\n−\n4\n1\\times 10^{-4}\n.\nAppendix S6\nAdditional Real-world Qualitative Results\nThis section presents additional qualitative results from real-world scenarios, complementing results in §\n4.3\nand further demonstrating the effectiveness of TT-VLA. Fig.\nS1\npresents three real-world rollouts of the “put banana on plate” task using TT-VLA. In the first episode, the robot initially grasps the banana but places it at an incorrect location. It then re-grasps the banana and successfully places it onto the plate. In the second episode, the robot grasps the banana and moves it to a position behind the plate; the policy subsequently corrects its direction and completes the placement. Similarly, in the third episode, the robot initially moves past to the right side of the plate before adjusting its motion to place the banana correctly. These qualitative results demonstrate TT-VLA’s ability to recover from execution errors and handle real-world uncertainties without retraining or human intervention.\nFigure S1:\nAdditional real-world qualitative results.\nEach row shows a real-world episode of the “put banana on plate” task, illustrating how TT-VLA adapts online to execution deviations and successfully completes the task using progress-based reward feedback.\nInput:\nPretrained VLA policy\nπ\nθ\n\\pi_{\\theta}\n, frozen progress estimator\nΦ\n​\n(\no\n0\n:\nt\n,\nl\n)\n\\Phi(o_{0:t},l)\n,\nlanguage instruction\nl\nl\n, observation horizon\nH\nH\n, update interval\nK\nK\n,\nclipping threshold\nε\n\\varepsilon\n, learning rate\nη\n\\eta\nOutput:\nTask actions\n1:\nfor\neach episode\ndo\n2:    Load pretrained VLA policy\nπ\nθ\n\\pi_{\\theta}\n; progress\np\n0\n←\n0\np_{\\text{0}}\\leftarrow 0\n; buffer\nℬ\n←\n∅\n\\mathcal{B}\\leftarrow\\emptyset\n; Environment resets to initial state\ns\n0\ns_{0}\n3:\nfor\neach time step\nt\n=\n0\n,\n1\n,\n2\n,\n…\n,\nT\nt=0,1,2,\\dots,T\ndo\n4:    Sample\na\nt\n∼\nπ\nθ\n​\n(\na\nt\n∣\no\nt\n−\n1\n,\nl\n)\na_{t}\\sim\\pi_{\\theta}(a_{t}\\mid o_{t-1},l)\n, get\nlog\n⁡\nπ\nθ\nold\n​\n(\na\nt\n∣\no\nt\n)\n\\log\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(a_{t}\\mid o_{t})\n, and execute\na\nt\na_{t}\n5:     Get new oberservation\no\nt\n+\n1\no_{t+1}\n6:     Compute\np\nt\n←\nΦ\n​\n(\no\n0\n:\nt\n,\nl\n)\np_{t}\\leftarrow\\Phi(o_{0:t},l)\n⊳\n\\triangleright\nEq.\n6\n7:     Compute\nr\nt\n←\np\nt\n−\np\nt\n−\n1\nr_{t}\\leftarrow p_{t}-p_{t-1}\n⊳\n\\triangleright\nEq.\n7\n8:     Store\n(\no\nt\n+\n1\n,\na\nt\n,\nr\nt\n,\nlog\n⁡\nπ\nθ\nold\n​\n(\na\nt\n∣\no\nt\n)\n)\n(o_{t+1},a_{t},r_{t},\\log\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(a_{t}\\mid o_{t}))\nin\nℬ\n\\mathcal{B}\n9:\nif\nt\nmod\nK\n=\n0\nt\\bmod K=0\nthen\n10:\nfor\neach\n(\no\ni\n,\na\ni\n,\nr\ni\n,\nlog\n⁡\nπ\nθ\nold\n​\n(\na\ni\n∣\no\ni\n)\n)\n∈\nℬ\n(o_{i},a_{i},r_{i},\\log\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(a_{i}\\mid o_{i}))\\in\\mathcal{B}\ndo\n11:        Compute\nr\ni\n(\nθ\n)\n←\nexp\n(\nlog\nπ\nθ\n(\na\ni\n∣\no\ni\n)\nr_{i}(\\theta)\\leftarrow\\exp(\\log\\pi_{\\theta}(a_{i}\\mid o_{i})\n−\nlog\nπ\nθ\nold\n(\na\ni\n∣\no\ni\n)\n)\n-\\log\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(a_{i}\\mid o_{i}))\n12:        Compute\nL\ni\n←\nmin\n(\nr\ni\n(\nθ\n)\n⋅\nr\ni\n,\nL_{i}\\leftarrow\\min(r_{i}(\\theta)\\cdot r_{i},\\,\nclip\n(\nr\ni\n(\nθ\n)\n,\n1\n−\nε\n,\n1\n+\nε\n)\n⋅\nr\ni\n)\n\\text{clip}(r_{i}(\\theta),1-\\varepsilon,1+\\varepsilon)\\cdot r_{i})\n⊳\n\\triangleright\nEq.\n4\n13:        Update policy parameters\nθ\n←\nθ\n+\nη\n​\n∇\nθ\n​\n∑\ni\nL\ni\n\\theta\\leftarrow\\theta+\\eta\\nabla_{\\theta}\\sum_{i}L_{i}\n14:    Clear buffer\nℬ\n\\mathcal{B}\n15:\nend if\n16:\nend for\n[4pt]\nAlgorithm 1\nTT-VLA Pipeline\nAppendix S7\nDiscussions on Using Test-Time GRPO in VLAs\nIn TT-VLA, we do not adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)\nShao\net al.\n(\n2024\n)\ndue to\ntwo practical constraints\nin test-time robotic deployment:\n1.\nGRPO relies on sampling multiple candidate trajectories or actions to update the policy, which introduces significant computational overhead and makes it inefficient for real-time test-time adaptation. Such sampling-based procedures are particularly unsuitable under test-time settings, where latency and responsiveness are critical.\n2.\nIn real-world robotic scenarios, sampled actions inevitably interact with the physical environment (\ne.g\n.\n, touching or moving objects). It is thus infeasible to reset the environment to a previous state after each interaction. These constraints make GRPO-style sampling-based optimization impractical for test-time adaptation in physical environments. In fact, that is the practical reason that we redefine the advantage to depend only on the reward obtained from the current action (see §\n9\n), as we want to prioritize rapid fitting of the current task rather than state accumulations.\nAppendix S8\nReproducibility\nTT-VLA is implemented in Pytorch\nPaszke\net al.\n(\n2019\n)\n. Experiments are conducted on NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada GPUs.\nTo guarantee reproducibility, our full implementation shall be publicly released upon paper acceptance.\nWe provide the pseudo code of TT-VLA in Algorithm\n1\n.\nAppendix S9\nTechnical Contributions\nOur study presents three principal technical contributions:\n•\nWe introduce a test-time reinforcement learning framework for VLA models, enabling robots to adapt their policies on the fly during deployment without requiring retraining or environment resets. This capability directly addresses a key limitation of current VLA systems in real-world robotic settings, where conditions are dynamic and unpredictable.\n•\nTo cope with the severe data scarcity and latency constraints at inference time, we propose a dense, progress-based reward that provides stable and task-aligned learning signals at every step, allowing robots to refine their behavior during execution.\n•\nExtensive experiments in both simulated and real-world robotic environments demonstrate that our approach consistently improves the robustness and success rates of existing SFT- and RL-based VLA models, highlighting its practical value for real-world robotic deployment.\nAppendix S10\nAsset License and Consent\nAll models and datasets used in this work are publicly available.\nWe strictly comply with their original licenses and use them only for non-commercial academic research.\nThe contents of datasets do not represent our views or opinions.\nModels.\nWe utilize four open-source models:\nNora (MIT license),\nOpenVLA (MIT license),\nOpenVLA-RL (MIT license),\nTraceVLA (MIT license).\nAll licenses permit academic research use; detailed terms are available via the original model repositories.\nDatasets.\nAll simulation experiments were conducted in ManiSkill 3. The evaluated tasks are adopted from\nLiu\net al.\n(\n2025a\n)\n, and detailed task descriptions are provided in §\nS3\n.\nThe data (16400 demonstration trajectories) used to warm up the base models is collected following the same\nprocedure as in\nLiu\net al.\n(\n2025a\n)\n, and is generated automatically.\nConsent.\nOur study does not involve crowdsourcing or human subjects. All results are derived from publicly available models and datasets.\nAppendix S11\nEthics Concerns\nTest-time policy adaptation may increase the risk of unintended or unsafe behaviors, particularly in real-world robotic environments where erroneous actions can result in physical damage, equipment failure, or harm to surrounding objects and people. Because policy updates are performed online and are driven by interaction-derived feedback rather than explicit human supervision, unexpected environmental dynamics or imperfect reward signals may lead to behaviors that deviate from intended task objectives. To mitigate these risks, responsible deployment should incorporate safeguards such as constrained action spaces, explicit safety and termination constraints, and conservative update mechanisms. In addition, human oversight and monitoring remain essential, especially during deployment in safety-critical or unstructured environments, to ensure that adaptive behaviors remain aligned with task goals and safety requirements.\nAppendix S12\nFuture Direction\nAs discussed in §\nS1.1\n, owing to the architectural distinctions between discretization-based and diffusion-based approaches, our study primarily focuses on the former. Future work should naturally extend our method to diffusion-based formulations, as TT-VLA provides a generalizable solution.\nAnother promising direction is to utilize test-time adaptation (TTA) methods for effectively augmenting multimodal information.\nIt should be noted that these discussions on future direction present engineering\nopportunities rather than insurmountable barriers.\nAppendix S13\nAI Disclosure\nWe acknowledge the use of GPT-5 for grammar checking only. The model was employed to correct grammatical errors while ensuring the original meaning and intent of the text remained unchanged.",
    "preview_text": "Vision-Language-Action models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for general-purpose robot learning, enabling agents to map visual observations and natural-language instructions into executable robotic actions. Though popular, they are primarily trained via supervised fine-tuning or training-time reinforcement learning, requiring explicit fine-tuning phases, human interventions, or controlled data collection. Consequently, existing methods remain unsuitable for challenging simulated- or physical-world deployments, where robots must respond autonomously and flexibly to evolving environments. To address this limitation, we introduce a Test-Time Reinforcement Learning for VLAs (TT-VLA), a framework that enables on-the-fly policy adaptation during inference. TT-VLA formulates a dense reward mechanism that leverages step-by-step task-progress signals to refine action policies during test time while preserving the SFT/RL-trained priors, making it an effective supplement to current VLA models. Empirical results show that our approach enhances overall adaptability, stability, and task success in dynamic, previously unseen scenarios under simulated and real-world settings. We believe TT-VLA offers a principled step toward self-improving, deployment-ready VLAs.\n\nOn-the-Fly VLA Adaptation via Test-Time Reinforcement Learning\nChangyu Liu\n1\n,\nYiyang Liu\n1\n1\n1\nfootnotemark:\n1\n,\nTaowen Wang\n2\n,\nQiao Zhuang\n1\n,\nJames Chenhao Liang\n3\n,\nWenhao Yang\n4\n,\nRenjing Xu\n2\n,\nQifan Wang\n5\n,\nDongfang Liu\n6\n,\nCheng Han\n1\n1\nUniversity of Missouri–Kansas City,\n2\nHong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou),\n3\nU.

            "answer": "## 论文核心分析：TT-VLA\n\n### **一、 核心问题**\n当前主流的**视觉-语言-动作模型**在部署时面临一个根本性缺陷：**策略僵化**。这些模型通常通过**监督微调**或**训练时强化学习**进行优化，一旦部署，其策略便固定不变。然而，真实世界（无论是仿真还是物理环境）是动态、不可预测的，存在大量**分布偏移**和**未见情况**。这导致现有VLA模型在动态环境中**适应性差、鲁棒性不足、任务成功率下降**。\n\n**简言之，论文要解决的核心问题是：如何让已部署的VLA机器人策略能够在测试/执行时，根据环境反馈进行实时、在线的自我调整和优化，而无需重新训练或人工干预。**\n\n### **二、 核心创新点**\n论文提出了 **TT-VLA** 框架，其核心创新在于将**测试时强化学习** 引入VLA领域，实现了 **“执行中策略自适应”** 。具体创新点如下：\n\n1.  **范式创新：首次系统性地为VLA模型设计测试时强化学习框架。**\n    *   打破了传统“训练-部署”分离的范式，允许模型在**单次任务执行过程中**持续优化策略。\n    *   不同于训练阶段的RL，TT-VLA专为**数据极度稀缺（单次episode）、延迟要求严格**的测试时场景设计。\n\n2.  **方法创新：设计了适用于测试时场景的密集奖励与无价值函数PPO优化。**\n    *   **密集进度奖励**：利用预训练的**Vision-Language-Action-Critic** 模型作为进度估计器 `Φ`，计算每一步的任务进度 `p_t`。奖励定义为进度差：`r_t = p_t - p_{t-1}`。\n        *   **优点**：提供每一步的即时反馈（非稀疏），鼓励单调进展，无需外部监督。\n    *   **无价值函数PPO**：由于测试时样本有限，学习准确的价值函数不可行。因此，TT-VLA对标准PPO进行了关键简化：\n        *   移除价值函数损失和熵正则项（设 `c1=0, c2=0`）。\n        *   将广义优势估计简化为**即时奖励**（设 `γ=0, λ=0`），即 `Â_t = r_t`。\n        *   这使得策略更新**直接、快速**地反映当前动作对任务进度的贡献，适合在线快速适应。\n\n3.  **理论贡献：为上述设计提供了理论依据。**\n    *   通过**命题1**和**推论1**证明了，当奖励是进度差时，若使用折扣的未来回报（`γ>0`）和标准价值函数，会导致**优势估计信号消失或产生负偏差**，从而解释了为何必须采用无折扣的即时奖励方案。\n    *   **引理1** 则形式化地证明了当 `γ=0` 且 `λ=0` 时，GAE退化为即时奖励，为“无价值函数PPO”提供了理论支撑。\n\n### **三、 解决方案概述**\nTT-VLA的解决方案是一个完整的在线适应管道：\n\n1.  **初始化**：加载一个预训练的VLA基础策略（如OpenVLA、Nora等）。\n2.  **交互与评估**：在每一个时间步 `t`：\n    *   策略根据当前观察 `o_t` 和指令 `l` 生成动作 `a_t` 并执行。\n    *   进度估计器 `Φ` 根据历史观察和指令，评估当前任务进度 `p_t`。\n    *   计算密集奖励 `r_t = p_t - p_{t-1}`。\n3.  **在线优化**：定期（如每8步）利用收集到的 `(状态, 动作, 奖励)` 数据，通过上述**无价值函数PPO目标**对策略参数进行梯度更新。\n4.  **持续适应**：更新后的策略立即用于后续决策，从而在**单个任务执行周期内**实现策略的持续微调。\n\n### **四、 实际价值与效果**\n*   **通用性强**：作为一个即插即用的框架，TT-VLA成功提升了**多种**主流开源VLA模型（Nora, OpenVLA, OpenVLA-RL, TraceVLA）在**未见任务**上的性能。\n*   **全面改进**：在仿真实验中，在**执行**（动态干扰）、**视觉**（纹理、噪声变化）、**语义**（新物体、新指令）三个维度的分布偏移下，模型成功率均获得**一致提升**（相对提升最高达44.4%）。\n*   **现实可行性**：在真实机器人（Franka Research 3）上的实验验证了其在实际物理世界中的有效性，能够在线纠正执行轨迹偏差，成功完成任务。\n*   **效率高**：相比需要重采样或重演算的测试时方法（如GRPO），TT-VLA的计算开销小，满足实时机器人部署的延迟要求。\n\n**总结**：TT-VLA的核心创新是提出了一套**理论扎实、设计精巧、实践有效**的测试时强化学习机制，使VLA机器人从“静态执行者”转变为“动态自适者”，为解决机器人在地化、终身学习等关键挑战迈出了重要一步。",

            "answer": "## 论文主要局限性分析\n\n基于对论文内容的分析，TT-VLA 框架虽然创新性地解决了 VLA 模型在测试时无法自适应的问题，但仍存在以下几个主要局限性：\n\n- **架构适用范围受限**：论文明确指出，当前方法主要针对**基于离散化动作空间**的 VLA 模型（如 OpenVLA、Nora）。对于另一大类**基于扩散模型**的 VLA（如 Diffusion Policy），由于其动作解码过程是隐式的、多步去噪的，与 PPO 等策略梯度方法所需的逐步对数似然计算不兼容，因此 TT-VLA 无法直接应用。论文§S1.1 将此列为未来工作方向。\n\n- **计算与实时性约束**：尽管论文通过**值函数免学习**和**单步优势估计**（`λ=0, γ=0`）大幅降低了计算开销，使其优于 EVOLVE-VLA 等基于 GRPO 的方法（§S7），但在**严格实时要求**的物理机器人场景中，每一步都进行策略更新（即使是低秩LoRA更新）仍可能带来不可忽略的延迟。论文中通过间隔8步更新（表2）来权衡，但这可能牺牲了部分即时适应性。\n\n- **奖励信号的依赖与质量**：TT-VLA 的核心依赖于一个**预训练的任务进度估计器 `Φ`**（文中使用 VLAC）。这个模块的性能直接决定了密集奖励 `r_t = p_t - p_{t-1}` 的质量。如果 `Φ` 在极端未见过的场景中估计不准，或对细微进展不敏感，则奖励信号可能失效，进而误导策略更新。\n\n- **安全性与鲁棒性风险**：论文在附录§S11中承认，**测试时在线策略更新**引入了新的风险。在动态、不确定的真实世界中，基于不完全或嘈杂的进度信号进行策略调整，可能导致意外甚至危险的行为。目前框架缺乏内置的安全约束或风险规避机制。\n\n- **单任务、单回合适应**：方法设计主要针对**单个任务回合内**的在线适应。它没有显式机制来**跨回合积累和转移知识**。如果一个机器人在不同日子执行相似任务，TT-VLA 每次都会从头开始适应，无法形成持续的经验积累和自我提升。\n\n## 未来可能的改进方向\n\n结合论文的讨论（特别是§S12）和分析，未来研究可以从以下几个方向深入：\n\n1.  **扩展到扩散型 VLA 模型**：\n    - 正如论文所建议，未来工作应探索将测试时强化学习适配到**扩散型 VLA**。这可能涉及设计新的策略梯度估计方法，以适应扩散模型的隐式策略和去噪过程，或者利用像 dVLA 那样将动作重新表述为自回归离散序列的架构。\n\n2.  **更高效、更安全的在线学习算法**：\n    - 开发计算开销更低的在线优化算法，例如更高效的二阶优化近似或动态调整更新频率的机制。\n    - 集成**安全强化学习**思想，在策略更新中引入成本函数或安全约束，防止策略在探索中产生破坏性行为。\n\n3.  **改进奖励塑造与进度估计**：\n    - 研究更鲁棒、更通用的**进度估计方法**，例如结合多模态大模型（VLMs）的零样本推理能力，或开发能在线小幅更新的进度估计器。\n    - 探索**混合奖励信号**，结合稠密进度奖励与稀疏任务成功奖励，或在奖励中引入关于动作平滑度、能耗等辅助目标。\n\n4.  **实现跨任务与跨回合的持续学习**：\n    - 将 TT-VLA 与**持续学习**或**元学习**框架结合。让机器人不仅在一个回合内适应，还能将多个回合、多个相关任务中学到的调整策略**抽象并存储**，形成可迁移的适应先验，实现真正的“部署即学习”。\n\n5.  **在更复杂、长视野任务中验证**：\n    - 当前实验主要集中在模拟和真实世界的**抓放操作**。未来需要在更复杂的、长视野的、包含更多子任务的场景（如装配、厨房操作）中验证 TT-VLA 的有效性，研究其在大状态空间和长期信用分配问题上的表现。\n\n**总结**：TT-VLA 为解决 VLA 模型在动态环境中部署的关键难题提供了开创性的思路。其局限性主要集中于架构普适性、计算效率、安全保证和知识积累方面。未来的改进将围绕**扩展模型兼容性、提升算法效率与安全性、设计更智能的奖励机制以及实现持续学习能力**展开，从而推动自改进、高可靠的具身智能系统走向现实。",
