    "html_content": "Deep Whole-body Parkour\nZiwen Zhuang\n12\n,\nShaoting Zhu\n12\n,\nMengjie Zhao\n1\nand\nHang Zhao\n12\n2\nAbstract\nCurrent approaches to humanoid control generally fall into two paradigms: perceptive locomotion, which handles terrain well but is limited to pedal gaits, and general motion tracking, which reproduces complex skills but ignores environmental capabilities. This work unites these paradigms to achieve perceptive general motion control. We present a framework where exteroceptive sensing is integrated into whole-body motion tracking, permitting a humanoid to perform highly dynamic, non-locomotion tasks on uneven terrain. By training a single policy to perform multiple distinct motions across varied terrestrial features, we demonstrate the non-trivial benefit of integrating perception into the control loop. Our results show that this framework enables robust, highly dynamic multi-contact motions—such as vaulting and dive-rolling—on unstructured terrain, significantly expanding the robot’s traversability beyond simple walking or running.\nI\nIntroduction\nFigure 1:\nData-driven whole-body control framework. Real-world environment scans and human demonstrations are processed and aligned to generate feasible motion-terrain pairs. A policy is trained via large-scale reinforcement learning with exteroceptive observations, enabling the robot to replicate agile behaviors in the real world.\nDeep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has fundamentally transformed the landscape of legged robotics, enabling systems to traverse complex environments with unprecedented robustness. By fusing proprioceptive data with exteroceptive observations—such as depth images or height maps—robots can now adapt their gait patterns to unstructured terrain in real-time\n[\n2\n,\n25\n,\n5\n]\n. This paradigm has rapidly evolved from low-speed navigation on static terrain to high-speed, agile maneuvers. Recent advancements have demonstrated that quadrupeds and humanoids are capable of dynamic parkour, autonomously leaping over gaps and climbing large obstacles\n[\n27\n,\n28\n,\n13\n]\n. However, despite these aggressive motions, this paradigm remains functionally limited to pedal locomotion. In these frameworks, the robot interacts with the environment exclusively through foot contacts, utilizing the upper body solely for balance rather than for contact-rich interaction. Consequently, while these robots can jump, they lack the capability to execute multi-contact skills—such as vaulting, scrambling, or hand-assisted climbing—that are essential for human-level traversability in constrained spaces.\nConversely, the second paradigm focuses on general motion tracking, a field rooted in computer graphics that prioritizes kinematic over environmental adaptability. In simulation, previous works such as DeepMimic\n[\n18\n]\nand AMP\n[\n19\n]\ndemonstrated physically simulated avatars capable of mastering a rich repertoire of skills—including backflips, martial arts, and parkour vaults—by imitating reference motion data. Recently, this paradigm has successfully bridged the sim-to-real gap, with various studies deploying imitation-based policies on physical humanoids to reproduce expressive behaviors in the real world\n[\n12\n,\n26\n,\n22\n,\n4\n]\n. However, a critical limitation persists: these approaches are predominantly environment-agnostic. They rely solely on tracking a pre-recorded trajectory rather than reacting to the geometry of the world. Consider the specific challenge of vaulting onto a high box platform: a blind tracking policy might perfectly reproduce the kinematics of the vault in open space, but without visual feedback, it cannot adjust its jump timing or hand placement to the specific height and distance of the box. As a result, the robot is destined to either collide with the platform or miss the critical hand contacts entirely.\nIn this work, we propose to bridge these distinct paradigms by integrating exteroceptive depth perception directly into a whole-body motion tracking framework. We introduce a system where the robot learns not merely to mimic a reference animation but to adapt it based on the visual occupancy of the environment. Crucially, the integration of depth perception yields non-trivial robustness to initial conditions. Unlike blind tracking baselines—which require the robot to be placed at a precise, predefined distance from the obstacle to align the playback trajectory—our visually guided policy operates in a closed loop. This allows the system to tolerate significant variance in the setup: for example, if the robot is initialized at varying distances or angles relative to the platform, the policy leverages visual feedback to autonomously adjust its approach gait—shortening or lengthening its steps—to ensure accurate hand placement and successful vaulting. This capability effectively transforms fragile, fixed-trajectory tracking into robust, spatially-aware capabilities suitable for real-world deployment.\nII\nRelated Works\nDeep Reinforcement Learning for Legged Control\nDeep RL has established a robust standard for locomotion by leveraging proprioceptive history and privileged simulation states\n[\n21\n,\n9\n,\n10\n,\n23\n]\n. Through teacher-student frameworks or asymmetric actor-critics, policies learn to estimate terrain properties implicitly\n[\n8\n,\n10\n,\n9\n,\n17\n]\n. While highly stable on continuous irregularities, these ”blind” agents are methodologically limited to reactive reflexes; without exteroception, they cannot anticipate or plan for discrete obstacles.\nPerceptive Locomotion\nIntegrating exteroception (e.g., depth or elevation maps) enables agents to modulate foot placement for upcoming terrain, facilitating dynamic parkour behaviors\n[\n16\n,\n1\n,\n27\n,\n28\n]\n. However, these systems typically rely on low-dimensional velocity commands (\nv\nx\n,\nv\ny\n,\nω\nz\nv_{x},v_{y},\\omega_{z}\n), leading to a\ntask under-specification\nproblem for humanoids. This low-bandwidth interface cannot disambiguate complex interaction modes—such as vaulting versus jumping—thereby restricting the robot to simple pedal locomotion despite its expressive morphology.\nData-Driven Humanoid Motion Tracking\nMotion tracking approaches, such as DeepMimic\n[\n18\n]\nand AMP\n[\n19\n]\n, utilize reference motions as a dense task specification, successfully transferring agile skills to physical hardware\n[\n14\n,\n22\n,\n6\n,\n7\n,\n12\n]\n. However, these frameworks fundamentally operate under a\nplanar environment assumption\n. They treat locomotion purely as kinematic reproduction on flat ground, disregarding the necessity to perceive terrain-dependent information. Consequently, without geometric awareness, they lack the capability to traverse non-planar structures or adapt the reference motion to physical obstacles.\nIII\nMethod\nIII-A\nDataset Curation and Environment Generation\nMotivation and Capture\nWhile large-scale motion datasets such as AMASS\n[\n15\n]\nprovide extensive human kinematic data, and OMOMO\n[\n11\n]\nintroduces object manipulation, they generally lack dynamic, whole-body interactions with large-scale geometry. Agile parkour maneuvers—such as vaulting, climbing, and hurdling—rely critically on precise contacts between the agent and the terrain. To bridge this gap, we curate a custom dataset that strictly couples human dynamics with accurate environmental geometry.\nWe employ an optical motion capture system to record expert human actors performing parkour maneuvers on physical obstacles. To ensure high-fidelity spatial correspondence between the motion and the terrain, we simultaneously digitize the physical scene using a LiDAR-enabled iPad Pro (via the 3D Scanner App). This process yields a reconstructed mesh that is spatially aligned with the captured motion trajectories (Figure\n1\n).\nMotion Retargeting\nThe raw human motion is retargeted to the Unitree G1 humanoid robot using the GMR framework\n[\n3\n]\n. This process utilizes optimization-based kinematic filtering, followed by manual keyframe adjustment, to ensure the resulting trajectories are physically feasible for the robot’s morphology. Special attention is paid to enforcing valid contact constraints and eliminating high-frequency capture noise.\nProcedural Environment Generation\nTo ensure the policy generalizes to diverse environments rather than overfitting to the specific spatial constraints of our capture laboratory, we post-process the scanned meshes for simulation. We isolate the functional geometry (e.g., obstacles, platforms, and rails) by segmenting out surrounding walls, ceilings, and extraneous laboratory context. This yields a set of canonical, context-agnostic obstacle meshes.\nFinally, we integrate these assets into NVIDIA Isaac Lab to create a massive-parallel training environment. We treat the retargeted motion and its corresponding obstacle mesh as a single\npaired instance\n. These pairs are procedurally instantiated across the simulation grid, creating an open-field training setup shown in Figure\n1\n. By stripping the scene of collision group artifacts (like room boundaries) and randomizing the placement of these motion-terrain pairs, we ensure the agent learns to condition its behavior strictly on local obstacle geometry.\nMassively Parallel Ray-Caster for Isolated Multi-Agent Training\nTo train a perceptive whole-body control policy within a unified framework, high-throughput depth simulation across thousands of parallel environments is essential. While IsaacLab provides GPU-accelerated simulation, clear limitations exist regarding sensor rendering: standard implementations struggle to simultaneously render complex moving articulations and static terrain while strictly isolating parallel environments. Specifically, distinct robots must not perceive ”ghost” instances of other robots residing in different environments within the same physics scene.\nTo address this, we implement a custom, highly optimized ray-caster utilizing Nvidia Warp. To maximize memory efficiency, we employ mesh instancing; we collect a set of collision mesh prototypes aligned with critical articulations and maintain a global batch of transform matrices for all active instances. We introduce a collision grouping mechanism where static terrain is assigned a universal group ID (\n−\n1\n-1\n), which is visible to all agents. Conversely, each robot is assigned a unique collision group ID to ensure disjoint perception.\nAlgorithm 1\nMassively Parallel Grouped Ray-Casting\n1:\nRay inputs\n𝐑\n=\n{\n(\n𝐨\ni\n,\n𝐝\ni\n,\ng\ni\n)\n}\ni\n=\n1\nN\nr\n​\na\n​\ny\n​\ns\n\\mathbf{R}=\\{(\\mathbf{o}_{i},\\mathbf{d}_{i},g_{i})\\}_{i=1}^{N_{rays}}\n(origin, direction, group ID),\nMesh instances\nℳ\n\\mathcal{M}\n,\nTransforms\n𝐓\n\\mathbf{T}\n,\nMesh Group IDs\n𝒢\nm\n​\ne\n​\ns\n​\nh\n\\mathcal{G}_{mesh}\n2:\nDepth map\n𝐃\n∈\nℝ\nN\nr\n​\na\n​\ny\n​\ns\n\\mathbf{D}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N_{rays}}\n3:\nPhase 1: Acceleration Structure Construction (Pre-compute)\n4:\nInitialize hash map\nℋ\nm\n​\na\n​\np\n:\nGroup ID\n→\nList of Mesh Indices\n\\mathcal{H}_{map}:\\text{Group ID}\\rightarrow\\text{List of Mesh Indices}\n5:\nfor\neach mesh instance\nm\nj\n∈\nℳ\nm_{j}\\in\\mathcal{M}\ndo\n6:\ng\n​\ni\n​\nd\n←\n𝒢\nm\n​\ne\n​\ns\n​\nh\n​\n[\nj\n]\ngid\\leftarrow\\mathcal{G}_{mesh}[j]\n7:\nAppend\nj\nj\nto\nℋ\nm\n​\na\n​\np\n​\n[\ng\n​\ni\n​\nd\n]\n\\mathcal{H}_{map}[gid]\n8:\nend\nfor\n9:\nDefine global static group\nG\ns\n​\nt\n​\na\n​\nt\n​\ni\n​\nc\n←\n−\n1\nG_{static}\\leftarrow-1\n10:\nPhase 2: Parallel Rendering (GPU Kernel)\n11:\nfor\neach ray\nr\ni\n∈\n𝐑\nr_{i}\\in\\mathbf{R}\nin parallel\ndo\n12:\nt\nm\n​\ni\n​\nn\n←\n∞\nt_{min}\\leftarrow\\infty\n13:\ng\na\n​\ng\n​\ne\n​\nn\n​\nt\n←\nr\ni\n.\ng\ni\ng_{agent}\\leftarrow r_{i}.g_{i}\n14:\n⊳\n\\triangleright\n1.

With tens of thousands of articulation parts in massively parallel training, this becomes a severe bottleneck. We propose a\nPrecomputed Grouped Ray-Casting\nstrategy to accelerate this process, as described in Algorithm\n1\n. We pre-compute a mapping from collision group indices to mesh instance IDs. Consequently, during the ray-marching phase, a ray associated with a specific agent iterates solely over the global static meshes and the specific subset of dynamic meshes belonging to that agent’s group. This reduces the search space significantly, resulting in a\n10\n×\n10\\times\nincrease in rendering speed compared to the naive baseline.\nIII-B\nTraining settings\nWe train the policy using both proprioception and exteroception, specifically through depth image. Following BeyondMimic\n[\n12\n]\nand VMP\n[\n20\n]\n, we design the reward terms by tracking the robot local poses in the relative frame and the global pose of the robot root link.\nRelative Frame\nBy defining the relative frame\nT\nrel\nT_{\\text{rel}}\n, we define the reference root transform\nT\nref\nT_{\\text{ref}}\nas the transform of the root link in the motion reference, and the robot actual root transform\nT\nrobot\nT_{\\text{robot}}\n.

We feed the policy with the synchronized future joint position reference, future joint velocity reference, future root position reference (in reference transform) and future robot rotation reference (in actual robot root transform). Then we feed the policy with one frame of noised depth image and a historical proprioception observation with 8 frames. For critic network, we feed the network with the synchronized future joint position reference, future joint velocity reference, future root position reference (in the actual robot root transform), future robot rotation reference (in the actual robot root transform), actual robot link transforms (in robot’s root transform), height-scan to the terrain, and a historical proprioception observation with 8 frames.\nFollowing BeyondMimic\n[\n12\n]\n, we train with simplified tracking rewards as follows:\n•\nGlobal root position reward based on distance to the reference position.\n•\nGlobal root rotation reward based on rotation difference to the reference rotation in axis angle.\n•\nLocal link position reward based on key links position differences in relative frame.\n•\nLocal link rotation reward based on key links rotation differences in relative frame in the magnitude of axis angle.\n•\nGlobal link linear velocity reward based on the key links linear velocity difference in the world frame.\n•\nGlobal link angular velocity reward based on the key links angular velocity difference in the world frame.\n•\nAction rate penalty.\n•\nJoint position limit penalty.\n•\nUndesired contact penalty.\n•\nApplied torque limits penalty.\nAdaptive Sampling\nAlgorithm 2\nAdaptive Sampling with Failure-Based Curriculum\n1:\nSet of reference motions\nℳ\n=\n{\nm\n1\n,\n…\n,\nm\nK\n}\n\\mathcal{M}=\\{m_{1},\\dots,m_{K}\\}\n2:\nBin duration\nΔ\n​\nt\nm\n​\na\n​\nx\n=\n1.0\n​\ns\n\\Delta t_{max}=1.0s\n3:\nSmoothing kernel\n𝒦\n\\mathcal{K}\n(e.g., Exponential)\n4:\nInitialize:\nDiscretize each\nm\nk\nm_{k}\ninto bins\nB\nk\n=\n{\nb\nk\n,\n0\n,\n…\n,\nb\nk\n,\nT\nk\n}\nB_{k}=\\{b_{k,0},\\dots,b_{k,T_{k}}\\}\n5:\nInitialize:\nFailure counts\nF\nk\n,\nt\n←\n0\nF_{k,t}\\leftarrow 0\nand Sampling Weights\nW\nk\n,\nt\n←\nUniform\nW_{k,t}\\leftarrow\\text{Uniform}\n6:\nfor\neach training iteration\ndo\n7:\n⊳\n\\triangleright\n1.

To handle variable-length reference trajectories, we discretize each motion into a sequence of temporal bins with a maximum duration of\nt\nbin\n=\n1.0\n​\ns\nt_{\\text{bin}}=1.0s\n. This standardization allows us to treat distinct motion segments uniformly, regardless of the total trajectory length. During training rollouts, we track the agent’s performance; if a termination or failure occurs, we increment the failure counter for the bin corresponding to the failure timestep. To maintain training stability and prevent abrupt distribution shifts, we apply temporal smoothing to these raw failure counts. This operation converts discrete integer counts into continuous failure scores, effectively diffusing the difficulty signal to adjacent timesteps. Finally, we utilize these smoothed scores to construct a probability distribution over all bins across all motions. The training reset state (which motion and what start time) is then sampled based on these weights, ensuring the agent prioritizes high-failure scenarios. The detailed implementation logic is shown in Algorithm\n2\n.\nEarly Timeout with Stuck Detection\nHowever, the randomization terms are not fully applicable to uniform randomization across the entire motion sequence. For example, the uniform randomization in sampling the robot state from the reference trajectory will place the robot in the middle of some terrain. This generates unsolvable situations for the policy to learn from. To resolve this issue, we truncate the trajectories that have caused the robot to get stuck over a given time limit at the start of the episode.\nNetwork inputs\nSince we design the training framework in one stage, the policy network does not have any odometry-related information. While based on the principle of asymmetric actor critic design, the critic network will have odometry-related information for more accurate value function prediction. Referring to\nZhuang and Zhao [\n26\n], Chen et al. [\n4\n], Ze et al. [\n24\n]\n, we train both policy network and critic network with 10 frames of future reference frame. Each frame has 0.1s interval with respect to the previous frame, which sums up to 1.0s future motion expectation.\nFor policy network, the inputs contain:\n•\nFuture joint position reference sequence.\n•\nFuture joint velocity reference sequence.\n•\nFuture base position reference sequence with respect to the base position of the reference frame.\n•\nFuture base rotation reference sequence with respect to the base rotation of the actual robot in simulator.\n•\nSingle frame of noised depth image from the robot’s camera.\n•\n8 frames of historical proprioception.\nFor critic network, the inputs contain:\n•\nFuture joint position reference sequence.\n•\nFuture joint velocity reference sequence.\n•\nFuture base position reference sequence with respect to the base position of the actual robot in simulator.\n•\nActual key links position in robot’s base frame.\n•\nActual key links rotation (tan-norm) in robot’s base frame.\n•\nHeight scan data.\n•\n8 frames of historical proprioception.\nNetwork architecture\nSince the motion tracking task is only spread across a handful number of motions, we use a straight-forward design, with a CNN encoder encoding the depth image and feed to a 3 layer MLP network together with the proprioception history. The detailed parameters are listed in the appendix.\nIII-C\nBridging sim-to-real gap in depth perception\nFigure 3:\nTo bridge the sim-to-real gap in depth visualization, we apply several noise patterns in simulation and applied inpainting algorithm from GPU-based OpenCV implementation.\nIt should be noted that we train our policy using synchronized depth image observations. We deploy the policy using 50Hz depth image using RealSense. However, the builtin filtering algorithm from pyrealsense does not meet the 50Hz requirement on the Nvidia Jetson’s CPU. We use the inpainting algorithm from a GPU-based OpenCV implementation. Due to occasionally artifacts pattern in the real world because of reflection, motion blur or stereo algorithm error, we add gaussian noise, patched artifacts to the depth image in simulation similar to\nZhuang et al. [\n27\n,\n28\n]\n. As shown in Figure\n3\n, the depth images fed into the network between simulation and real-world are quite similar in terms of pixel pattern.\nIII-D\nDeployment\nTo deploy the policy onboard with depth sensing running at 50Hz, we adopt ONNX as our neural network accelerator. Even though the motions are trained to a single depth-based neural network, we still need to choose the motion reference as input. Thus, we implemented a state machine mechanism to select the motion during deployment.\nAlso, to generate running logs during the real-world experiments while reducing the impact on the neural network process as low as possible, we run rosbag recording in a separate process. Also, we bind the CPUs separately for running the neural network and rosbag recording process to prevent further CPU scheduling.\nConsidering the policy is trained with root position reference in motion reference frame, this part of the observation does not depend on the odometry of the robot, neither in simulation nor in the real-world. Thus, we do not need any odometry system providing global position error between the robot and the motion reference. We provide the exact same joint position, joint velocity reference to the policy as it is trained. We provide the relative rotation difference based on the real-time IMU readings of the robot, before which the start heading of the motion reference was aligned to the robot’s actual heading. After correcting the heading of the motion reference, as well as the direction of the reference position sequence, we provide the policy with only the position reference relative to the frame of reference position without any odometry information.\nIV\nExperiments\nIn this section, we aim to raise and answer some questions, addressing the pros and cons of adding exteroception to the highly agile motion tracking system. Also, to test the generalization across multiple terrains and multiple motions in the same terrain, we curate 4 motions across 3 different terrains. One is the triangular barrier formed by two road ramps. One is a big wooden box the size of\n0.5\n​\nm\n×\n0.6\n​\nm\n×\n0.4\n​\nm\n0.5m\\times 0.6m\\times 0.4m\n. The last terrain is only the flat terrain, as the complementary experiment to show that the system can still perform non-interactive motions in flat terrain. The 4 motions consist of ‘kneel climb’, ‘roll vault’, ‘dive roll’, and ‘jump sit’.\nWe first run real-world experiments to the effectiveness of our pipeline that can be successfully deployed in the real robot, then we analyze the effect of adding depth vision to the system by proposing the following questions:\n1.\nWhat benefit does the additional depth vision provide to this agile whole-body control system that interacts with the unstructured terrain?\n2.\nAre there any drawbacks when depth vision is provided as additional information? Is it robust to unseen but trivial distractors in the scene?\n3.\nThroughout the entire training pipeline, what contributes the most to the successful sim-to-real deployment on the real robot without any odometry system?\nIV-A\nReal world experiment\nIn the real world experiment, we deploy our entire inference system using ROS2 on a Unitree G1 29-DOF, September 2025 version. The neural network is accelerated using ONNX (CPU version) onboard. We acquire the depth image using an Intel RealSense D435i installed on the head of the Unitree G1 in an individual process separate from the network inference process. We integrate a simple walking process to keep balance when the perceptive parkour policy is not activated. At each test, we control the robot to walk to a rough starting point with no accurate odometry or localization system. We then trigger the motion tracking policy with a specific motion reference trajectory. The system switches back to a walking policy when the motion reference trajectory is exhausted.\nWe perform real-world tests both indoors and outdoors. With indoor environments, we were able to collect running logs using a network cable from another computer. In outdoor environments, we only connect to the onboard compute without an additional logging system. Please notice that, in outdoor environments, the starting point of the motion is not determined. We only put the robot in front of the obstacle without any further calibration.\nIV-B\nNon-trivial benefit of depth vision\nTABLE I:\nComparison of training variants across four motions.

We uniformly spawn the robot around the initial starting position of the reference motion to test to what extent the policy is able to recover and successfully finish the motion. As shown in Figure\n6\nwe visualize the convergence of the robots in a batch, which start at different positions. As time goes on, all robots converge to the target obstacle and successfully finish the motion tracking task. Even though all trainings randomize the starting position at\n0.3\n​\nm\n×\n0.3\n​\nm\n0.3m\\times 0.3m\nhorizontally around the reference motion. We test the motion convergence behavior with the range of\n0.5\n​\nm\n×\n0.5\n​\nm\n0.5m\\times 0.5m\nhorizontally around the reference starting point.\nFigure 4:\nWe show the\nx\n−\ny\nx-y\nposition variance in a single batch of motion reference example to illustrate the emergence of positional correction ability when introducing depth vision to the end-to-end motion tracking system.\nWe then plot the position variance in x-y coordinate to further verify this observation in Figure\n4\n. The position variance drastically converges to a really low value. When the motion reaches its final stage, some of the position variances increase due to the common visual features from the depth camera.\nFigure 5:\nWe do a grid search around the starting position of the motion reference frame. We plot the headmap of the success rate of each motion at a\n1.2\n​\nm\n×\n1.2\n​\nm\n1.2m\\times 1.2m\nspace. Red suggests the\n100\n%\n100\\%\nsuccess rate, while dark blue suggests the\n0\n%\n0\\%\nsuccess rate.\nTo further test the generalization ability of this visual-guided motion tracking pipeline, we perform a more aggressive out-of-distribution tests, even though the randomization during training is only from\n−\n0.15\n​\nm\n-0.15m\nto\n+\n0.15\n​\nm\n+0.15m\nin\nx\nx\nand\ny\ny\ncoordinate. We plot the success rate headmap from\n−\n0.6\n​\nm\n-0.6m\nto\n+\n0.6\n​\nm\n+0.6m\naround the initial motion reference starting point. This forms a\n1.2\n​\nm\n×\n1.2\n​\nm\n1.2m\\times 1.2m\nrange of initialization. As shown in Figure\n5\n, the success rate of the motion tracking system is still\n100\n%\n100\\%\n. It only drops at the boundary of these experiments.\nFigure 6:\nWe show a series of direct example, illustrating the positional convergence when introducing depth vision in this end-to-end motion tracking system. As shown in this figure, the position converges automatically even before the scene interaction. Otherwise, for difficult motions like roll-vaulting and kneel-climbing, misplace at the scale of\n0.4\n​\nm\n0.4m\nwill lead to catastrophic failure of the scene-interaction task.\nIV-C\nVision robustness\nIn this section, we aim to study the robustness of this additional depth information in the motion tracking system. We build several scenes in the simulator that have never been used during training. They are the out-of-distribution cases for the trained motion tracking network. Considering the reference motions are still the same, the added entities in the scene should block the robot’s dynamics as little as possible.\nFigure 7:\nHere we provide examples of adding distractors in the scene to test the robustness of adding unseen objects in the middle of the motion trajectory. We define “wide distractor” (top-left), “plane distractor” (bottom-left) and “wall distractor” (right). They present different visual sensor information while not disrupting the original motion trajectory too much.\nAs shown in Figure\n7\n, we construct different objects in the scene as distractors and make sure the robot sees the additional objects. Some of the distractors do disrupt the dynamics of the entire motion, e.g, the bottom left example. We tested different variants of distractors and observed no drop in the success rate when running the same motion tracking system.\nTABLE II:\nMotion Tracking Evaluation: MPJPE-Global\nMPJPE\ng\n\\text{MPJPE}_{g}\nand MPJPE-Base\nMPJPE\nb\n\\text{MPJPE}_{b}\nacross different distractor conditions.\nDistractor Condition\nKneel Climb\nRoll Vault\nMPJPE\ng\n\\text{MPJPE}_{g}\nMPJPE\nb\n\\text{MPJPE}_{b}\nMPJPE\ng\n\\text{MPJPE}_{g}\nMPJPE\nb\n\\text{MPJPE}_{b}\nNo Distractor\n0.1022\n0.0390\n0.1159\n0.0349\nWide Distractor\n0.4848\n0.0405\n0.1543\n0.0373\nPlane Distractor\n0.4261\n0.0417\n0.5598\n0.0809\nWall Distractor\n0.1603\n0.0401\n0.1157\n0.0372\nWe focus on 2 motions that are suitable to add distractors while not significantly blocking the dynamics of the motion trajectory. As shown in Table\nII\n, we test the MPJPE in both the base frame and the world frame compared with the original terrain used in training. In total, there are 4 variants for both roll-vaulting and kneel-climbing. For each variant and the original training scene, we run a batch of 100 robots using the same policy network in the simulator at once. To make a fair comparison, we remove randomization when initializing the robot in the scene. As shown in Table\nII\n, only the plane distractor significantly increase the MPJPE metric, since the long platform changes the potential motion dynamics compared to the original reference motion. For the wide distractor, it also leads to larger MPJPE. By analyzing the motion, the wide beam disrupts the localization ability of the motion tracking policy. Thus, the MPJPE metric increases.\nIV-D\nAblation on the training recipe\nIn this section, we run ablation studies on several critical components of the entire training framework. There are several critical components in our training framework:\n1.\nTraining with depth input.\n2.\nRandomizing the initialization strategy with stuck detection, which prevents physically impossible rollouts.\n3.\nDefining local tracking rewards in the relative frame instead of the robot’s base frame.\nAs shown in Table\nI\n, training motion tracking without exteroception is not robust to initial position perturbation. The starting position has to be exact, or it may face catastrophic failure during scene interaction. When trained only with local frame reward instead of the reward in the relative frame, the policy tends to track more accurate locally, but performs worse than our pipeline globally in interaction intensive cases. Also, we show the non-trivial benefit of applying stuck detection mechanism to prevent large portion of rollout steps becoming useless data samples. Training without stuck detection leads to slightly higher MPJPE error, while still successfully finished the entire motion tracking trajectory.\nV\nConclusion\nIn this work, we present a generalizable paradigm for humanoids to learn agile, physics-based interactions directly from human demonstrations and onboard sensing. We advance beyond standard motion tracking by unifying it with perceptive control into a\nsingle scalable training framework\n. Our analysis highlights the non-trivial benefits of depth vision for robustness against environmental distractors and validates the system through successful deployment in diverse indoor and outdoor real-world scenarios.\nFurthermore, by enabling fully end-to-end training with exteroception, this framework provides the critical infrastructure required for scaling up the training system of humanoid whole-body control. This end-to-end approach unlocks the potential to train extensive libraries of motion skills with intensive scene interaction. While challenges regarding data volume and autonomous skill selection remain, they outline a clear path for future research. Ultimately, this work establishes a baseline for developing general-purpose humanoid controllers capable of mastering contact-rich environments in a fully learned, end-to-end manner.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work is accomplished with the help of Xiangting Meng, Siqiao Huang, Yizhuo Gao, and Tairan He.\nReferences\nAgarwal et al.

            "answer": "## 论文《Deep Whole-body Parkour》技术脉络与发展方向梳理\n\n基于论文内容及其引用的前作，该研究方向的发展脉络可以清晰地划分为几个关键阶段和不同的技术发展方向。其核心演进逻辑是**从单一范式（感知或模仿）走向融合，从简单任务（足式移动）走向复杂任务（全身接触交互），从仿真走向现实**。\n\n### 发展脉络总览\n\n该领域主要围绕两大技术范式展开竞争与融合：\n1.  **感知式移动**：关注环境适应，但仅限于足式步态。\n2.  **全身运动跟踪**：关注复杂技能复现，但忽略环境感知。\n\n《Deep Whole-body Parkour》的工作是这两大范式融合的里程碑。\n\n### 分阶段技术演进与改进\n\n#### 第一阶段：基础范式确立 (2018-2021)\n此阶段两大范式各自独立发展，奠定了技术基础。\n\n*   **全身运动跟踪范式 (以DeepMimic, AMP为代表)**\n    *   **前作**：Peng et al. (2018) 的 **DeepMimic** 和 (2021) 的 **AMP**。\n    *   **核心贡献**：在仿真中，通过模仿学习（强化学习+参考运动数据）使虚拟角色掌握丰富的技能（如后空翻、武术、跑酷）。\n    *   **改进与局限**：\n        *   **改进**：相比之前的物理控制方法，能生成更自然、更复杂的全身运动。\n        *   **局限**：**环境无关**。策略是“盲目的”，仅跟踪预定义轨迹，无法根据实际环境几何（如障碍物高度、距离）调整动作。这导致其无法在非结构化地形上可靠执行需要精确接触的任务（如撑跳）。\n\n*   **感知式移动范式 (以RMA、盲走策略为代表)**\n    *   **前作**：Hwangbo et al. (2019), Lee et al. (2020), Kumar et al. (2021) 的 **RMA** 等。\n    *   **核心贡献**：将本体感知与外部感知（如深度图）结合，使足式机器人能在复杂地形上实现鲁棒的行走、奔跑甚至跳跃。\n    *   **改进与局限**：\n        *   **改进**：从低速静态地形导航发展到高速敏捷机动，实现了对地形的实时适应。\n        *   **局限**：**功能受限**。交互仅限于足部接触，上半身仅用于平衡。无法执行需要手部接触的复杂技能（如撑跳、攀爬），即“任务欠规范”问题——低维速度指令无法区分“跳跃”和“撑跳”等不同交互模式。\n\n#### 第二阶段：范式深化与仿真到现实的迁移 (2022-2024)\n此阶段两大范式均在各自方向上深化，并开始尝试向真实机器人部署。\n\n*   **全身运动跟踪的“现实化”**\n    *   **前作**：Luo et al. (2023), Chen et al. (2025), Liao et al. (2025) 的 **BeyondMimic** 等。\n    *   **核心贡献**：成功将模仿学习策略迁移到实体人形机器人上，在真实世界中复现了富有表现力的行为。\n    *   **改进**：**跨越了仿真到现实的鸿沟**。通过改进训练框架、状态表示和系统辨识，使仿真中训练的策略能直接或经微调后部署于硬件。\n    *   **遗留问题**：**环境感知问题仍未解决**。这些工作大多基于“平面环境假设”，在部署时仍要求机器人起始位置与参考轨迹严格对齐，缺乏对非平面地形的适应能力。\n\n*   **感知式移动的“复杂化”**\n    *   **前作**：Zhuang et al. (2023, 2024) 的 **Robot/Humanoid Parkour Learning**, Agarwal et al. (2022, 2023), Miki et al. (2022)。\n    *   **核心贡献**：使四足和人形机器人能够执行动态跑酷，如自主跨越沟壑、攀爬大型障碍。\n    *   **改进**：将感知能力应用于更动态、更具挑战性的足式移动任务。\n    *   **遗留问题**：**交互模式依然单一**。尽管动作更激进，但本质上仍是“踏板式移动”，未利用上半身进行接触式交互。\n\n#### 第三阶段：范式融合与系统创新 (2025 - 本工作)\n《Deep Whole-body Parkour》作为作者团队（Zhuang, Zhao等）工作的延续，实现了质的飞跃。\n\n*   **前作基础**：直接建立在 **Humanoid Parkour Learning** (Zhuang et al., 2024) 的感知移动，以及 **BeyondMimic** (Liao et al., 2025) 和 **Embrace Contacts** (Zhuang & Zhao, 2025) 的运动跟踪技术之上。\n*   **本工作的核心改进与创新**：\n    1.  **范式统一**：首次将**外部感知深度集成到全身运动跟踪框架**中。策略不仅模仿动画，还能根据环境的视觉占据信息进行自适应调整。\n    2.  **任务升级**：从“足式跑酷”升级为“**全身接触式跑酷**”。机器人可以执行撑跳、滚翻等多接触技能，极大扩展了在非结构化地形上的通过性。\n    3.  **鲁棒性突破**：解决了盲跟踪策略对初始位置极度敏感的问题。通过视觉反馈形成闭环控制，能容忍起始位置和角度的大范围变化，自动调整步态以确保成功交互。\n    4.  **工程化创新**：\n        *   **数据**：创建了**运动-地形配对数据集**，通过动作捕捉和LiDAR扫描确保人体动力学与环境几何的高保真对齐。\n        *   **仿真**：设计了**大规模并行分组光线投射器**（Algorithm 1），解决了数千个并行环境中GPU深度模拟的隔离与效率瓶颈，渲染速度提升10倍。\n        *   **训练**：引入了**基于失败的自适应课程学习**（Algorithm 2）和**卡死检测**，显著提升训练效率和样本质量。\n        *   **部署**：采用**相对帧奖励设计**，使策略不依赖于全局里程计，仅需IMU和关节参考即可在真实世界运行，简化了部署。\n\n### 着重发展的几个方向\n\n1.  **感知与控制的融合方向**：这是最核心的主线。从“无感知的模仿”和“仅足部感知的移动”，发展到“**全身感知模仿**”。本工作是这一方向的集大成者，证明了融合带来的非平凡收益（对初始条件的鲁棒性）。\n2.  **技能复杂化与交互多元化方向**：从“行走/奔跑”到“动态跳跃”，再到“**多接触全身技能**”（撑跳、跪姿攀爬、滚翻）。交互点从脚扩展到手、膝、躯干，更接近人类的移动能力。\n3.  **仿真到现实迁移的鲁棒性方向**：从依赖精确的仿真模型和系统辨识，发展到通过**感知输入对齐**（在仿真中对深度图像添加真实噪声和修复）和**策略结构设计**（相对帧、无里程计依赖）来直接跨越虚实鸿沟。\n4.  **大规模训练的系统工程方向**：为了解决学习复杂技能所需的海量数据，研究从单环境训练发展到**大规模并行仿真**。本工作中的定制化光线投射器和课程学习机制，是支撑复杂任务训练得以实现的关键基础设施创新。\n\n**总结**：该方向的发展是一个从**分治**到**统一**、从**简单**到**复杂**、从**虚拟**到**现实**的螺旋上升过程。《Deep Whole-body Parkour》标志着人形机器人控制进入了一个新阶段，即通过端到端学习，获得在复杂环境中执行接触式、全身性敏捷技能的能力，为通用人形控制器的发展奠定了坚实基础。",

            "answer": "## 论文分析：评价指标与数据集\n\n本文提出了一种将感知与全身运动跟踪相结合的人形机器人控制框架。其核心在于使用**自定义采集的数据集**和**特定的评价指标**来训练和验证模型。\n\n### 一、 数据集细节\n\n本文没有使用现有的通用大规模运动数据集（如AMASS），因为它们缺乏与大型地形几何结构的动态全身交互数据。作者**专门为研究定制了一个数据集**。\n\n| 数据项 | 具体细节与描述 |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **数据内容** | **人类跑酷动作**，包括但不限于：撑跳、翻滚、跪姿攀爬、跳坐等需要与障碍物进行多接触的敏捷动作。 |\n| **采集设备** | 1. **光学动作捕捉系统**：用于记录专业演员的动作轨迹。<br>2. **带LiDAR的iPad Pro**（通过3D Scanner App）：用于同步扫描和数字化演员表演时所处的**真实物理障碍物场景**。 |\n| **核心特点** | **严格的动作-地形配对**：确保每个动作演示都与其发生时的精确环境几何结构（网格模型）在空间上对齐（如图1所示）。这是实现感知运动控制的基础。 |\n| **后处理** | 1. **运动重定向**：使用GMR框架将人体动作重定向到Unitree G1人形机器人，通过优化和手动调整确保物理可行性。<br>2. **环境生成**：从扫描的网格中分割出功能性障碍物（如箱子、栏杆），去除实验室背景，生成**通用的、与上下文无关的障碍物资产**。 |\n| **训练使用** | 将重定向后的动作序列与其对应的障碍物网格作为“配对实例”，在NVIDIA Isaac Lab中**程序化地、大规模并行地实例化**，创建多样化的训练环境，防止模型过拟合到特定场景。 |\n\n### 二、 评价指标细节\n\n论文主要通过仿真实验和指标对比来量化方法的性能，主要评价指标如下：\n\n| 评价指标 | 计算方式与物理意义 | 用途与解读 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **MPJPE₉ (全局平均关节位置误差)** | **Mean Per Joint Position Error (Global)**。计算所有关键关节在**世界坐标系**下的位置与参考运动对应关节位置之间的平均欧氏距离。 | 衡量**整体运动跟踪的全局精度**。值越小，说明机器人实际完成的动作在三维空间里与目标动作越接近。这对于评估与障碍物交互（如手是否准确撑到箱子）至关重要。 |\n| **MPJPEᵦ (基座坐标系平均关节位置误差)** | **Mean Per Joint Position Error (Base)**。计算所有关键关节在**机器人基座坐标系**下的位置与参考运动对应关节位置之间的平均欧氏距离。 | 衡量**局部姿态模仿的精度**，排除了全局位置和偏航角的影响。值小说明机器人的身体姿态、四肢相对位置模仿得好。 |\n| **成功率** | 在特定初始位置范围内，策略成功完成整个动作序列（如成功撑跳越过障碍）的比率。 | **综合性能的直观体现**。论文通过网格搜索绘制热力图（图5），展示了方法在远超训练分布的大范围初始位置下仍能保持高成功率，证明了其**鲁棒性和泛化能力**。 |\n| **位置收敛方差** | 在仿真中，从不同初始位置开始的一批机器人，其`(x, y)`水平位置随时间变化的方差。 | 直观展示**深度视觉引入的“位置自动校正”能力**。如图4所示，方差迅速减小，表明策略能利用视觉信息主动调整步态，使所有个体收敛到正确的交互点，而“盲跟踪”策略无法做到这一点。 |\n| **对干扰物的鲁棒性** | 在仿真场景中添加训练时未见过的干扰物（如宽梁、平板、墙，见图7），使用上述MPJPE指标评估策略性能是否下降。 | 测试**感知系统的稳健性**。如表II所示，大部分干扰物未导致性能显著下降，说明策略关注的是与任务相关的关键地形特征，而非被无关视觉信息误导。 |\n\n### 三、 指标与数据集的核心关联\n\n1.  **数据驱动训练**：**定制化的动作-地形配对数据集**是训练“感知运动跟踪”策略的基石，使策略能够学习动作如何根据地形几何进行调整。\n2.  **指标验证价值**：\n    - **MPJPE₉ 和 MPJPEᵦ** 共同揭示了策略的跟踪质量。论文的消融实验（表I）表明，**没有深度视觉**的策略在初始位置随机化时MPJPE₉急剧上升，证明了感知对于在非结构化地形上保持全局精度的“非平凡益处”。\n    - **成功率与收敛性** 指标直接验证了论文的核心主张：**融合感知实现了从脆弱的轨迹回放到鲁棒的空间感知能力的转变**，使人形机器人能在真实世界不确定的初始条件下成功完成复杂任务。\n\n**总结**：本文通过精心构建的**配对数据集**解决了训练数据缺失的问题，并设计了一套**多角度的评价指标体系**（精度、鲁棒性、泛化性），系统性地证明了将外感知深度信息集成到全身运动跟踪框架中的有效性和巨大优势。",

            "question": "论文在哪些数据集上进行了实验？主要的评估指标和性能提升是多少？",
            "answer": "## 论文实验数据集、评估指标与性能分析\n\n### 一、 实验数据集\n论文构建并使用了**自定义的、严格耦合运动与环境的配对数据集**，而非直接使用现有公开数据集。具体构建流程如下：\n\n- **数据采集**：\n    - **运动数据**：使用光学动作捕捉系统记录专业跑酷运动员在真实障碍物上执行动态技能（如撑跳、翻滚、跪姿攀爬）。\n    - **环境数据**：使用搭载LiDAR的iPad Pro（通过3D Scanner App）同步扫描物理场景，生成与运动轨迹空间对齐的高精度三维网格。\n- **数据处理**：\n    - **运动重定向**：使用GMR框架将人体运动数据优化并重定向至Unitree G1人形机器人，确保运动学可行性。\n    - **环境泛化**：从扫描网格中分割出核心障碍物功能几何体，去除实验室背景，生成一组**上下文无关的规范障碍物网格**。\n- **训练环境生成**：将**运动-地形配对实例**程序化地实例化到NVIDIA Isaac Lab的大规模并行仿真环境中，通过随机化位置来确保策略学习依赖于局部几何而非特定布局。\n\n### 二、 主要评估指标\n论文采用了两类核心指标来评估运动跟踪的精度和鲁棒性：\n\n1.  **MPJPE-Global (`MPJPE_g`)**：\n    - **定义**：**全局运动轨迹误差**。计算机器人关键关节位置与参考运动在**世界坐标系**下的位置差异。\n    - **意义**：衡量**整体运动跟踪的绝对精度**，尤其关注与障碍物交互（如手部放置、身体跨越）的全局准确性。误差增大会直接导致任务失败。\n\n2.  **MPJPE-Base (`MPJPE_b`)**：\n    - **定义**：**基座（躯干）相对运动误差**。计算机器人基座（骨盆）的位姿与参考运动在**机器人自身基座坐标系**下的差异。\n    - **意义**：衡量**局部姿态模仿的保真度**，反映策略在无环境交互或平坦地形上跟踪参考运动形态的能力。\n\n### 三、 性能提升与关键发现\n论文通过消融实验和对比测试，验证了其框架（集成深度感知的全身运动跟踪）带来的显著性能提升：\n\n#### 1. **核心性能提升：对初始位置扰动的鲁棒性**\n- **问题**：传统“盲跟踪”方法（如BeyondMimic基线）严重依赖精确的初始位姿。一旦机器人的起始位置与参考轨迹预设位置存在偏差，极易导致交互失败（如撞上或错过障碍物）。\n- **本文方法提升**：通过引入深度视觉形成**闭环控制**，策略能主动调整步态和时机以适应实际距离。\n- **数据佐证**（参见表I及图4,5,6）：\n    - **训练外泛化**：尽管训练时只在`±0.15m`范围内随机化起始位置，但测试时在**`±0.6m`（总计1.2m×1.2m）的广阔范围内**，成功率仍接近100%。\n    - **轨迹收敛**：从不同起始点出发的机器人，其`(x, y)`位置方差会随着时间迅速收敛，确保在关键交互时刻准确对齐障碍物。\n    - **指标对比**：在“带位置随机化”的测试中，本文方法（`ours`）的全局误差`MPJPE_g`显著低于无深度感知的基线（`w/o depth`）。例如，在“Dive Roll”动作中，误差从`0.2267`降至`0.1649`。\n\n#### 2. **深度感知的鲁棒性验证**\n- **测试场景**：在仿真中引入训练未见过的视觉干扰物（如宽梁、平板、墙），这些物体提供新的深度信息但基本不阻碍运动动力学。\n- **发现**（参见表II）：\n    - 对于多数干扰物（如宽梁、墙），策略的`MPJPE_b`（局部保真度）保持稳定，说明策略**未对干扰物产生过激反应**，保持了运动跟踪的核心能力。\n    - 仅当干扰物显著改变场景动力学（如“平板干扰物”横穿路径）时，`MPJPE_g`会上升，这属于合理预期。\n\n#### 3. **训练框架关键组件的贡献**\n消融研究（表I）明确了各组件的重要性：\n- **深度输入 (`w/o depth`)**：移除后，在位置随机化下的性能**急剧下降**，证明了感知对于适应环境几何是不可或缺的。\n- **卡死检测 (`w/o stuck detection`)**：移除后，`MPJPE`误差普遍轻微上升。该机制通过剔除物理上不可能的初始状态，**提升了训练数据质量和效率**。\n- **相对帧奖励 (`local frame reward`)**：使用机器人基座坐标系下的奖励代替本文的“相对帧”奖励，会导致**局部跟踪更准但全局交互性能下降**，验证了相对帧设计在解耦全局路径调整与局部姿态模仿方面的优势。\n\n### 总结\n本文通过**自定义的、运动-环境配对数据集**进行实验，使用**`MPJPE_g`（全局精度）和`MPJPE_b`（局部保真度）** 作为核心指标。实验表明，其提出的**感知全身运动跟踪框架**带来了**非平凡的（non-trivial）性能提升**：\n- **核心价值**：将脆弱、依赖精确初始化的开环运动跟踪，转变为**对起始位置具有高度鲁棒性（>1米范围）的闭环自适应系统**。\n- **实际意义**：这使得在**无需精确定位和里程计**的户外非结构化环境中，部署动态、接触丰富的全身技能（如跑酷）成为可能，极大拓展了人形机器人的实际通过性和实用性。",

            "answer": "## 论文主要局限性分析\n\n基于对论文内容的分析，本文提出的“感知全身跑酷”框架虽然取得了显著进展，但仍存在以下主要局限性：\n\n- **数据与技能库的规模限制**：论文训练的策略仅针对**4种特定动作**（跪姿攀爬、翻滚跨越、鱼跃翻滚、跳跃坐下）在3种地形上进行。这距离一个能够处理任意地形、执行任意接触式技能的“通用”控制器还有很大差距。数据收集（动作捕捉与场景扫描）过程成本高昂且复杂，限制了技能库的快速扩展。\n\n- **动作选择与序列化的挑战**：在部署时，系统需要一个**状态机机制**来手动选择输入的动作参考轨迹。论文未实现**自主的动作技能选择与序列化**。在复杂环境中，机器人需要根据感知信息自动判断“何时、使用何种技能”来跨越障碍，这是实现完全自主导航的关键瓶颈。\n\n- **感知模态与理解的局限**：\n    - 仅使用了**单目深度图像**作为外部感知输入，缺乏语义信息（如材质、可抓握区域识别）。\n    - 系统对“干扰物”的鲁棒性测试（IV-C节）表明，虽然对不阻碍动力学的物体鲁棒，但像“平台干扰物”这种改变地形结构的物体会导致性能下降。这说明其感知更多是几何驱动，而非基于物理交互的深层理解。\n    - 未涉及动态或移动障碍物。\n\n- **仿真到现实的差距虽被缓解但未根除**：尽管通过添加噪声和修复算法（III-C节）来弥合深度感知的sim-to-real差距，但这种方法依赖于对真实噪声模式的建模。对于更复杂的传感器故障（如大面积缺失、强烈反射）或未建模的物理特性（如地面摩擦系数突变），策略的鲁棒性仍有待验证。\n\n- **计算效率与实时性**：策略部署依赖于50Hz的深度图像和ONNX加速，但在资源受限的嵌入式平台（如Jetson）上同时运行感知、网络推理和底层控制，对系统的实时性和可靠性提出了持续挑战。\n\n---\n\n## 未来可能的改进方向\n\n针对上述局限性，未来的研究可以从以下几个方向展开：\n\n- **扩展技能库与自动化数据生成**：\n    - 利用**大规模人类视频数据**（如互联网跑酷视频）结合**3D场景重建**技术，以半自动或自动化的方式生成“动作-地形”配对数据，降低数据收集成本。\n    - 探索**生成模型（如扩散模型）** 来自动生成多样化的、物理可行的参考动作，或对现有动作进行适配性变形。\n\n- **实现高层技能规划与自主序列化**：\n    - 在现有底层策略之上，构建一个**高层规划器**。该规划器基于更丰富的环境感知（可能包含语义分割、拓扑分析）来实时选择并序列化底层技能，以完成复杂的穿越任务。\n    - 研究**基于LLM/VLM的语义场景理解与任务分解**，将自然语言指令转化为一系列可执行的技能。\n\n- **增强感知与理解能力**：\n    - 融合**多模态感知**，如RGB图像（用于语义识别）、触觉传感（用于接触力优化）、惯性信息等，使机器人能理解地形的功能属性（如“可支撑”、“可抓握”）。\n    - 引入**世界模型**或**前瞻性预测**，让机器人能预测动作的潜在后果，从而在接触前进行更精细的调整。\n\n- **提升仿真真实性与训练效率**：\n    - 采用**域随机化**和**系统辨识**的更高级形式，让策略能适应更广泛的未建模物理动态。\n    - 探索**离线强化学习**与**大规模仿真预训练**结合，利用海量无标签仿真数据先学习基础运动能力，再通过高效在线调优适配具体技能。\n\n- **端到端架构的深化**：\n    - 探索**完全端到端**的架构，将感知、规划、控制整合进一个统一的、可微分的学习框架中，减少模块化设计带来的信息损失和误差累积。\n    - 研究**终身学习**机制，使机器人能在实际部署中持续从成功和失败的经验中学习并改进技能。\n\n**总结而言，本文的核心价值在于成功地将感知与全身运动跟踪相结合，为通用人形机器人控制奠定了关键的技术基础。未来的工作将围绕“扩展性”、“自主性”和“通用性”展开，目标是实现一个能像人类一样在复杂、未知环境中自如运用全身进行移动和操作的智能体。**",
