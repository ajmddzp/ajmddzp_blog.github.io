This increasing variety in robot shapes, together with the inherent complexity of real-world environments, presents significant challenges for trajectory optimization tasks. As a fundamental component of trajectory optimization for mobile robots, collision avoidance is crucial for enabling safe navigation in confined spaces. A widely adopted geometric modeling assumption in robot planning is to treat the robot as a mass point and ensure safety either by inflating obstacles\n[\n4\n,\n20\n,\n27\n]\nor enforcing a minimum distance constraint\n[\n15\n]\n. While this simplification improves the efficiency of formulating and solving the optimization problem, it inevitably leads to conservatism in planning tasks. Similar geometric simplifications, such as representing robots with ellipsoids\n[\n13\n,\n14\n]\nor convex polyhedrons\n[\n19\n,\n23\n,\n3\n]\n, are also commonly used. These geometric simplifications tend to yield conservative solutions, frequently underestimating the feasible maneuverability of non-convex robots in complex environments.\nFigure 1:\nComparison of collision avoidance constraints for a C-shaped robot in a tight cornering scenario. (a)\nProposed method\n. Separating hypersurfaces (yellow curves) are generated to partition the robot and obstacles within the workspace of interest (dark gray).\n(b)\nCorridor-based methods\n. Relying on convex decompositions of the collision-free space, these methods fail to find a convex free region (yellow region) large enough to contain the robot fully.\n(c)\nSeparating hyperplane-based methods\n. These methods enforce a separating hyperplane (yellow dotted line) between each obstacle and the robot’s convex hull, resulting in an overly conservative solution space.\nThe separating hyperplane theorem\n[\n2\n]\n, a basic result in convex analysis, serves as the theoretical foundation for many trajectory planning methods. They represent robots and obstacles as convex sets and employ hyperplanes to separate these entities\n[\n19\n,\n14\n,\n6\n]\n. By searching for such a hyperplane, these methods can efficiently ensure collision avoidance between the robot and each obstacle.\nHowever, for robots and obstacles with inherently complex shapes, using convex hulls or other rough convex approximations can result in a significant loss of available free space. This often prevents the robot from traversing passages that would otherwise be feasible, thus limiting the planner’s effectiveness in narrow environments.\nTo overcome the conservatism of convex approximations, we propose a novel trajectory optimization approach that extends the concept of linear separators to polynomial separating hypersurfaces, as illustrated in Fig.\n1\n. We theoretically establish that any two disjoint bounded closed sets can be strictly separated by the zero-level set of a polynomial. This theoretical guarantee allows us to directly handle arbitrary robot morphologies by modeling the robot and the obstacles as such bounded closed sets. Based on this principle, we formulate a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem where the robot’s profile is characterized by a set of collision points, and obstacle point clouds are grouped into clusters with extracted feature points. By enforcing separation constraints directly on these discrete representations, the resulting NLP can be efficiently solved in real time, enabling fast replanning in cluttered and narrow environments.\nIn summary, the main contributions of our work are as follows:\n•\nWe propose a novel collision evaluation approach based on polynomial separating hypersurfaces and theoretically prove that any two disjoint bounded closed sets can be strictly separated by a polynomial hypersurface, providing a sound guarantee for separating arbitrary-shaped robots from obstacles.\n•\nWe develop a unified NLP formulation that employs polynomial separating hypersurfaces as collision constraints and jointly optimizes the robot’s trajectory and polynomial coefficients. By expressing collision avoidance as tractable, pointwise polynomial constraints over the robot’s profile and clustered obstacle point clouds, our formulation significantly reduces computational complexity while accommodating arbitrary robot geometries.\n•\nWe integrate the proposed NLP formulation into an online local planner and validate its effectiveness through extensive simulations and real-world experiments. The results demonstrate that our proposed planner outperforms existing methods, enabling non-convex shaped robots to generate safe and smooth trajectories through cluttered and narrow environments in real-time.\nII\nRelated Works\nTypically, robot geometry in trajectory planning tasks is simplified as a mass point, a sphere, an ellipsoid, or a convex polyhedron. These abstractions are widely used to keep collision checking and trajectory optimization computationally tractable.\nA variety of methods have been developed for robot collision evaluation. Among them, representative approaches include corridor-based methods\n[\n16\n,\n8\n,\n9\n,\n24\n,\n11\n,\n12\n,\n10\n,\n23\n]\n, signed distance field (SDF)-based methods\n[\n7\n,\n22\n,\n26\n,\n3\n]\n, and separating hyperplane-based methods\n[\n19\n,\n14\n,\n6\n]\n, all of which aim to achieve more precise whole-body collision evaluation while maintaining computational efficiency.\nCorridor-based methods construct a sequence of overlapping convex regions to approximate the robot’s free space and constrain the robot to stay within these safe regions. An early work\n[\n4\n]\ncombines IRIS-based convex segmentation with mixed-integer optimization to generate continuously collision-free polynomial trajectories. Specifically, it assigns trajectory segments within safe regions for robots modeled as spheres. A recent study\n[\n11\n]\nmodels robot geometry with polynomial inequalities and enforces collision-free motion via a sum-of-squares framework that constrains the robot to locally extracted convex free regions.\nSDF-based methods encode obstacle information as signed distance fields and incorporate the resulting distance evaluations into the trajectory optimization problem, either as cost terms or as explicit collision-avoidance constraints. A recent work\n[\n7\n]\nproposes a Robo-centric ESDF pre-built in the robot body frame. By evaluating only relevant obstacle points, this method reduces computational time while ensuring accurate whole-body collision evaluation for arbitrary-shaped robots.\nIn\n[\n3\n]\n, the signed distance between polyhedrons is formulated as the optimal value of a convex program, and collision avoidance is enforced by enumerating vertex-based signed distance constraints within a mixed complementarity problem framework, enabling exact collision checking between the polyhedral robot and obstacles. However, these SDF-based methods are often computationally intensive when performing precise collision checking, making real-time replanning challenging.\nSeparating hyperplane-based collision checking methods determine safety by finding a hyperplane that separates the robot and each obstacle. MADER\n[\n19\n]\nparameterizes robot and obstacle trajectories using the MINVO basis to obtain convex polyhedron representations in Euclidean space, and introduces separating hyperplanes as optimization variables to ensure safe motion in dynamic environments.\nAlthough separating hyperplane-based methods are efficient and suitable for real-time replanning, their reliance on convex representations of both robot and obstacles inherently limits their ability to achieve precise planning for robots with non-convex shapes.\nTo address this limitation, a recent work\n[\n6\n]\nextends the separating hyperplane concept to non-convex geometries by representing the robot and obstacles as unions of convex polyhedrons and ellipsoids. They utilize the hyperplane separation theorem to formulate differentiable separating constraints between these decomposed convex parts. By incorporating the S-procedure for boundary containment, their framework significantly reduces the number of auxiliary variables compared to standard dual reformulations, though the computational burden of NLPs remains substantial for high-frequency real-time applications.\nIII\nmethodology\nIII-A\nPolynomial Separating Hypersurface\nIn our trajectory optimization approach, both the robot and the obstacles are modeled as bounded closed sets in Euclidean space, without assuming convexity (see Fig.\n2\n). Since we aim to jointly optimize the robot’s trajectory and the polynomial-parameterized hypersurface that separates the robot from each obstacle to ensure motion safety, the feasibility of such separators becomes essential.\nClassical methods rely on the separating hyperplane theorem\n[\n2\n, Chapter 2.5.1, page 46]\n, which guarantees a linear separator for convex sets. However, this result does not extend to nonconvex sets or nonlinear surfaces. To provide the theoretical foundation required by our approach, we show that any two disjoint closed sets can be separated by a polynomial hypersurface, with the sets lying in different connected components of its complement. This existence result not only subsumes the linear case but also ensures that our optimization problem is well-posed. A formal proof is provided below.\nWe first introduce a variant of Urysohn’s lemma\n[\n25\n, Lemma 15.6, page 102]\n, which will be used in our analysis:\nLemma 1\n.\nA space\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\nis normal if and only if whenever A and B are disjoint closed sets in\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\n, there is a continuous function\ng\n:\n𝒮\n→\nℝ\ng:\\mathcal{S}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}\n, such that\ng\n​\n(\n𝒂\n)\n=\n0\n,\n∀\n𝒂\n∈\nA\n,\ng(\\boldsymbol{a})=0,\\ \\forall\\,\\boldsymbol{a}\\in A,\ng\n​\n(\n𝒃\n)\n=\n1\n,\n∀\n𝒃\n∈\nB\n.\ng(\\boldsymbol{b})=1,\\ \\forall\\,\\boldsymbol{b}\\in B.\nWhile Lemma\n1\nguarantees separation by continuous functions,\nnumerical optimization requires an algebraic representation. We now extend this existence guarantee to polynomial separating hypersurfaces.\nTheorem 1\n.\nFor any two disjoint bounded closed sets\nA\nA\n,\nB\n⊂\nℝ\nn\nB\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{n}\n, there exists a polynomial function\np\n​\n(\n𝐱\n)\np(\\boldsymbol{x})\n, such that\np\n​\n(\n𝒂\n)\n<\n0\n,\n∀\n𝒂\n∈\nA\n,\np(\\boldsymbol{a})<0,\\ \\forall\\,\\boldsymbol{a}\\in A,\np\n​\n(\n𝒃\n)\n>\n0\n,\n∀\n𝒃\n∈\nB\n.\np(\\boldsymbol{b})>0,\\ \\forall\\,\\boldsymbol{b}\\in B.\nProof.\nLet\n𝒮\n∈\nℝ\nn\n\\mathcal{S}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}\nbe a closed ball containing\nA\nA\nand\nB\nB\n.

In general, there may be infinitely many such hypersurfaces. In practical applications, we restrict attention to the subspace\n𝒜\nd\n⊂\n𝒜\n\\mathcal{A}_{d}\\subset\\mathcal{A}\n, which contains all polynomials with degree up to\nd\nd\n(e.g.,\nd\n=\n1\n,\n2\n,\n…\nd=1,2,\\dots\n). Note that when\nd\n=\n1\nd=1\n, this formulation naturally reduces to the classical separating hyperplane constraint. That is, only polynomials in\n𝒜\nd\n\\mathcal{A}_{d}\nare considered as candidate separating hypersurfaces. Our method is effective whenever a separating polynomial can be found within this subspace\n𝒜\nd\n\\mathcal{A}_{d}\nunder consideration. Empirically, polynomials of relatively low degree are typically sufficient to achieve separation between the robot and obstacles, ensuring the practical applicability of this approach in most scenarios.\nIII-B\nTrajectory Optimization Problem Formulation\nIn this section, we apply the polynomial separating hypersurfaces introduced above to formulate the trajectory optimization problem for a holonomic ground robot. The robot’s state at time\nt\nt\nis given by\n𝒒\n​\n(\nt\n)\n=\n{\nx\n​\n(\nt\n)\n,\ny\n​\n(\nt\n)\n,\nψ\n​\n(\nt\n)\n}\n\\boldsymbol{q}(t)=\\{x(t),y(t),\\psi(t)\\}\n, where\n(\nx\n,\ny\n)\n(x,y)\ndenotes the position and\nψ\n\\psi\ndenotes the orientation of the robot. The velocity control input is denoted by\n𝒖\n​\n(\nt\n)\n=\n{\nv\nx\n​\n(\nt\n)\n,\nv\ny\n​\n(\nt\n)\n,\nω\n​\n(\nt\n)\n}\n\\boldsymbol{u}(t)=\\{v_{x}(t),v_{y}(t),\\omega(t)\\}\n, where\nv\nx\nv_{x}\nand\nv\ny\nv_{y}\nare the translational velocities in the robot body frame and\nω\n\\omega\nis the angular velocity.\nFor trajectory optimization, we discretize the time horizon\nT\nT\ninto\nN\nN\nsteps with stamps\nτ\n=\n0\n,\n1\n,\n…\n,\nN\n\\tau=0,1,\\ldots,N\n. The robot’s trajectory is then represented by the sequence of states\n𝒳\n=\n{\n𝒒\n0\n,\n𝒒\n1\n,\n…\n,\n𝒒\nN\n}\n\\mathcal{X}=\\{\\boldsymbol{q}_{0},\\boldsymbol{q}_{1},\\ldots,\\boldsymbol{q}_{N}\\}\nand control inputs\n𝑼\n=\n{\n𝒖\n0\n,\n𝒖\n1\n,\n…\n,\n𝒖\nN\n−\n1\n}\n\\boldsymbol{U}=\\{\\boldsymbol{u}_{0},\\boldsymbol{u}_{1},\\ldots,\\boldsymbol{u}_{N-1}\\}\n, where\n𝒒\nτ\n\\boldsymbol{q}_{\\tau}\nand\n𝒖\nτ\n\\boldsymbol{u}_{\\tau}\ndenote the state and control input at discrete time step\nτ\n\\tau\n, respectively.\nWe specialize the separation method to the plane\nℝ\n2\n\\mathbb{R}^{2}\nand employ quadratic polynomials (\nd\n=\n2\nd=2\n) to define the separating hypersurfaces.

The input penalty is defined as\nJ\nu\n=\n∑\nτ\n=\n0\nN\n−\n1\n𝒖\nτ\n⊤\n​\nR\n​\n𝒖\nτ\n,\nJ_{u}=\\sum_{\\tau=0}^{N-1}\\boldsymbol{u}_{\\tau}^{\\top}R\\boldsymbol{u}_{\\tau},\n(12)\nwhere\n𝒖\nτ\n=\n(\nv\nx\n,\nτ\n,\nv\ny\n,\nτ\n,\nψ\nτ\n)\n\\boldsymbol{u}_{\\tau}=(v_{x,\\tau},v_{y,\\tau},\\psi_{\\tau})\ndenotes the control input at time step\nτ\n\\tau\n.\nIII-B\n4\nPolynomial Coefficients Penalty\nIn our trajectory optimization problem (\nIII-B\n), directly searching for polynomial coefficients within the feasible region often leads to abnormal coefficient values. For instance, excessive numerical values in the polynomial coefficients or excessive numerical differences between different terms can result in undesirable geometric properties, which in turn cause poor performance of the polynomial separating hypersurfaces. By applying a small penalty to each polynomial coefficient, we encourage smoother hypersurfaces.\nFormally, the polynomial coefficients penalty is defined as\nJ\np\n=\n∑\nk\n=\n1\nK\ncoef\n​\n(\np\nk\n)\n⊤\n​\nQ\np\n​\ncoef\n​\n(\np\nk\n)\n,\nJ_{p}=\\sum_{k=1}^{K}\\text{coef}(p_{k})^{\\top}Q_{p}\\text{coef}(p_{k}),\n(13)\nwhere\ncoef\n​\n(\np\nk\n)\n\\text{coef}(p_{k})\nis the coefficients vector for the\nk\nk\n-th separating polynomial, and\nQ\np\nQ_{p}\nis a diagonal weighting matrix.\nIt is worth noting that the weights in\nQ\np\nQ_{p}\nare set to be several orders of magnitude smaller than those in the tracking, terminal, smoothness or input cost terms. This ensures that the coefficient penalty serves only as a gentle regularization, preventing extreme parameter values without unduly constraining the expressiveness of the separating surface.\nFurthermore, the weights corresponding to higher-order terms are chosen to be even smaller. This design encourages geometric simplicity by suppressing unnecessary higher-order terms. When the robot’s non-convexity is not strictly required for collision avoidance, the separating hypersurface naturally degenerates into a simple separating hyperplane. This adaptive behavior ensures that the planner utilizes complex nonlinear separators only when the environment’s complexity demands it, thereby maintaining computational efficiency and trajectory smoothness.\nIII-B\n5\nRobot Representation and Separating Constraints\nThe organization of separating hypersurface constraints in our optimization framework is grounded in Theorem\n1\n, which guarantees the existence of polynomial hypersurfaces capable of separating any two disjoint bounded closed sets in workspace\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\n.\nAt each time step\nτ\n\\tau\n(\nτ\n=\n0\n,\n1\n,\n…\n,\nN\n\\tau=0,1,\\ldots,N\n), the space occupied by the robot\nℬ\nτ\n\\mathcal{B}_{\\tau}\nand any surrounding obstacle\n𝒪\nk\n\\mathcal{O}_{k}\n(\nk\n=\n1\n,\n2\n,\n…\n,\nK\nk=1,2,\\ldots,K\n) within\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\ncan be regarded as bounded closed sets. We use a polynomial\np\nk\n,\nτ\np_{k,\\tau}\n, as described in (\n2\n), to separate the robot\nℬ\nτ\n\\mathcal{B}_{\\tau}\nand the obstacle\n𝒪\nk\n\\mathcal{O}_{k}\n. The corresponding polynomial separation constraint can be formulated as\np\nk\n,\nτ\n​\n(\nx\ni\n,\nτ\n)\n≥\n0\n,\n∀\nx\ni\n,\nτ\n∈\nℬ\nτ\n,\n\\displaystyle p_{k,\\tau}(x_{i,\\tau})\\geq 0,~\\forall x_{i,\\tau}\\in\\mathcal{B}_{\\tau},\n(14)\np\nk\n,\nτ\n​\n(\ns\nj\n)\n≤\n0\n,\n∀\ns\nj\n∈\n𝒪\nk\n,\nj\n=\n1\n,\n2\n,\n…\n,\nN\n𝒪\nk\n.\n\\displaystyle p_{k,\\tau}(s_{j})\\leq 0,~\\forall s_{j}\\in\\mathcal{O}_{k},~j=1,2,\\ldots,N_{\\mathcal{O}_{k}}.\n(15)\nFor the NLP problem (\nIII-B\n), (\n14\n) introduces\nK\n⋅\nN\nℬ\n​\n(\nN\n+\n1\n)\nK\\cdot N_{\\mathcal{B}}(N\\!+\\!1)\nnonlinear constraints, where\nK\nK\nis the number of obstacles and\nN\nℬ\nN_{\\mathcal{B}}\nis the number of check points on the robot. (\n15\n) introduces\nN\n𝒪\n​\n(\nN\n+\n1\n)\nN_{\\mathcal{O}}(N\\!+\\!1)\nlinear constraints, where\nN\n𝒪\n=\n∑\nk\n=\n1\nK\nN\n𝒪\nk\nN_{\\mathcal{O}}=\\sum_{k=1}^{K}N_{\\mathcal{O}_{k}}\ndenotes the total number of sampled points on all surrounding obstacles. In addition, the number of optimization variables amounts to\n6\n​\nN\n+\n6\n​\nK\n​\n(\nN\n+\n1\n)\n+\n3\n6N\\!+\\!6K(N\\!+\\!1)\\!+\\!3\n, making real-time trajectory optimization computationally infeasible.\nTo overcome this limitation, we replace the robot body in the constraints with\n𝒱\nℬ\n\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{B}}\n, which is the union of the robot’s occupied sets over the optimization horizon. For a robot represented as a bounded closed set in Euclidean space, the union of the robot’s occupied sets over the planning horizon, denoted as\n𝒱\nℬ\n=\n⋃\nτ\n=\n0\nN\nℬ\nτ\n\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{B}}=\\bigcup_{\\tau=0}^{N}\\mathcal{B}_{\\tau}\n, is also a bounded closed set in the Euclidean space.\nAccordingly, we reformulate constraints (\n14\n) and (\n15\n) into a new form as in (\nIII-B\n):\np\nk\n​\n(\nx\ni\n)\n≥\n0\n,\n∀\nx\ni\n∈\n𝒱\nℬ\n,\ni\n=\n1\n,\n2\n,\n…\n,\nN\n𝒱\nℬ\n,\n\\displaystyle p_{k}(x_{i})\\geq 0,~\\forall x_{i}\\in\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{B}},~i=1,2,\\dots,N_{\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{B}}},\n(16)\np\nk\n​\n(\ns\nj\n)\n≤\n0\n,\n∀\ns\nj\n∈\n𝒪\nk\n,\nj\n=\n1\n,\n2\n,\n…\n,\nN\n𝒪\nk\n.\n\\displaystyle p_{k}(s_{j})\\leq 0,~\\forall s_{j}\\in\\mathcal{O}_{k},~j=1,2,\\ldots,N_{\\mathcal{O}_{k}}.\n(17)\nThis approach reduces the number of optimization variables by\n6\n​\nK\n​\nN\n6KN\nand the number of nonlinear constraints by\nK\n​\nN\nℬ\n​\nN\nKN_{\\mathcal{B}}N\n, thereby improving the trajectory safety and greatly accelerating the optimization process.\nIII-C\nObstacle Representation\nIn our trajectory optimization problem, obstacles within the workspace\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\nare modeled as bounded closed sets, consistent with the assumptions of Theorem\n1\n. To implement the collision constraints formulated in (\n17\n), it is essential to provide an efficient and practical representation of obstacles.\nWe represent obstacles using processed point clouds, which are well aligned with the requirements of our pointwise polynomial separation constraints. In real-time trajectory optimization, operating directly on lidar point clouds substantially reduces computational overhead relative to mesh map construction.\nSpecifically, the point cloud data within the workspace\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\nis first downsampled using a voxel grid filter to reduce data redundancy and then segmented based on Euclidean distance clustering. This process groups the raw points into\nK\nK\ndistinct obstacle clusters\n{\n𝒪\n^\nk\n}\nk\n=\n1\nK\n\\{\\widehat{\\mathcal{O}}_{k}\\}_{k=1}^{K}\n, where each cluster ideally corresponds to an individual obstacle or a connected obstacle component. The clustering distance can be set according to the robot’s traversability, allowing the segmentation to reflect practical navigational constraints.\nAfter clustering, we select a subset of representative points that lie close to the geometric boundary of the cluster, as these boundary points capture the shape of the obstacle more effectively.\nLet\n𝒪\n^\nk\n=\n{\n𝒐\n1\n,\n𝒐\n2\n,\n…\n,\n𝒐\nm\n}\n\\widehat{\\mathcal{O}}_{k}=\\{\\boldsymbol{o}_{1},\\boldsymbol{o}_{2},\\ldots,\\boldsymbol{o}_{m}\\}\ndenote the\nk\nk\n-th obstacle cluster, where each\n𝒐\ni\n∈\nℝ\n3\n\\boldsymbol{o}_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}\nis a point in Cartesian coordinates and\nM\nk\nM_{k}\nis the number of all points in\n𝒪\n^\nk\n\\widehat{\\mathcal{O}}_{k}\n. For each point\n𝒐\ni\n∈\n𝒪\n^\nk\n\\boldsymbol{o}_{i}\\in\\widehat{\\mathcal{O}}_{k}\n, we define a dispersion score\nc\ni\n=\n1\nM\nk\n−\n1\n​\n∑\nj\n=\n1\n,\nj\n≠\ni\nM\nk\n‖\n𝒐\nj\n−\n𝒐\ni\n‖\n2\n,\nc_{i}=\\frac{1}{M_{k}-1}\\sum_{j=1,j\\neq i}^{M_{k}}\\bigl\\|\\boldsymbol{o}_{j}-\\boldsymbol{o}_{i}\\bigr\\|_{2},\n(18)\nwhich measures the average Euclidean distance from\n𝒐\ni\n\\boldsymbol{o}_{i}\nto all other points in the same cluster. Intuitively, points located near the geometric exterior of the cluster tend to have larger dispersion scores, whereas interior points tend to have smaller scores.\nWithin each cluster\n𝒪\n^\nk\n\\widehat{\\mathcal{O}}_{k}\n, points are sorted in descending order of\nc\ni\nc_{i}\n. Starting from the largest\nc\ni\nc_{i}\n, we iteratively add the point\n𝒐\ni\n\\boldsymbol{o}_{i}\nto the feature set\n𝒪\nk\n\\mathcal{O}_{k}\nas a new feature point\ns\nj\ns_{j}\nonly if it is sufficiently far from all previously selected feature points, i.e.,\n‖\n𝒐\ni\n−\n𝒔\nℓ\n‖\n2\n≥\nr\nd\n,\n∀\nℓ\n≤\ni\n,\n\\bigl\\|\\boldsymbol{o}_{i}-\\boldsymbol{s}_{\\ell}\\bigr\\|_{2}\\geq r_{d},\\quad\\forall\\,\\ell\\leq i,\n(19)\nwhere\nr\nd\n>\n0\nr_{d}>0\nis a predefined distance threshold, and\nN\n𝒪\nk\nN_{\\mathcal{O}_{k}}\nis the resulting number of selected feature points in\n𝒪\n^\nk\n\\widehat{\\mathcal{O}}_{k}\n. This selection yields a compact set of geometrically peripheral and mutually well-separated feature points, providing an efficient and expressive representation of the obstacles.\nIV\nResults\nIn this section, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed method for different trajectory optimization tasks. In simulations, we employ an L-shaped holonomic robot as the test platform, as shown in Fig.\n3\n(a), and evaluate its trajectories when traversing narrow passages of different widths and cluttered forest environments with varying obstacle densities. The key performance metrics are recorded and analyzed in comparison with other baseline methods.\nIn the real-world experiments, we mount an L-shaped frame on a Unitree Go2 quadruped robot. The frame extends beyond the robot’s original body length and width, emulating the non-convex shapes that mobile robots may exhibit in practical applications (e.g., with manipulators or external payloads). With this non-convex profile, as shown in Fig.\n3\n(b), the robot employs our method to perform real-time trajectory optimization and react online to changes in the cluttered indoor environment.\nAll simulations are executed on a desktop computer equipped with an Intel Core i9-12900KF CPU, and in the real-world experiments, we stream data wirelessly between this desktop and the quadruped robot in real time, and perform online trajectory optimization on the desktop.\nThe NLPs in (\nIII-B\n) are formulated using CasADi’s C++ interface\n[\n1\n]\nand solved by IPOPT\n[\n21\n]\n, with MA57\n[\n5\n]\nselected as the sparse linear solver within IPOPT.\nFigure 3:\nRobot models used in simulations and experiments.\n(a) L-shaped robot model adopted in simulations.\n(b) Quadruped robot used in the real-world experiments. Its geometric profile (white region) is a non-convex shape composed of an L-shaped frame and a central rectangular body.\nIV-A\nSimulations\nIV-A\n1\nNarrow Passage\nIn the narrow passage simulation environment shown in Fig.\n4\n, the L-shaped robot must adjust its pose to traverse passages whose widths are comparable to, or even smaller than, its own length and width, which makes this scenario representative for evaluating the traversability of non-convex robots in tight spaces.\nFigure 4:\nThe performance of our proposed method in the narrow passage scenario.\n(a) Visualization of the L-shaped robot navigating through a passage narrower than its own dimensions.\n(b)-(c) Illustration of how separating hypersurfaces (yellow curves) work when traversing the narrow passage.\nTABLE II:\nComparison of key metrics for different trajectory planners in environments with varying gap widths.\nGap Width\nMetric\nOurs\nFASTER\nDDR-OPT\nHyperplane\nw\n1\n=\n1.4\nw_{1}=1.4\nm\nPath Length (m)\n4.36\nN/A\n4.60\n4.51\nTotal Time (s)\n9.65\nN/A\n12.31\n9.95\nSuccess Rate (%)\n100\n0\n100\n100\nw\n2\n=\n1.2\nw_{2}=1.2\nm\nPath Length (m)\n4.36\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nTotal Time (s)\n10.48\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nSuccess Rate (%)\n100\n0\n0\n0\nw\n3\n=\n1.0\nw_{3}=1.0\nm\nPath Length (m)\n4.38\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nTotal Time (s)\n10.05\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nSuccess Rate (%)\n100\n0\n0\n0\nWe evaluate the proposed trajectory planner on this task and compare it against three online planners: FASTER (corridor-based)\n[\n20\n]\n, DDR-OPT (ESDF-based)\n[\n26\n]\n, and a separating hyperplane-based method modified from MADER\n[\n19\n]\n.\nIn these planners, FASTER models the robot as a single sphere with a diameter of 1.7 m, while DDR-OPT tightly envelops the L-shaped body with five spheres, each with a diameter of 0.29 m. The separating hyperplane-based method uses a convex polyhedron that tightly bounds the L-shaped robot.\nAll planners are run in a receding-horizon fashion to generate real-time trajectories, under the same limits on velocity and acceleration. The start and goal configurations are kept identical for all planners and all gap widths, with a straight-line distance of\nd\ntask\n=\n4.0\n​\nm\nd_{\\text{task}}=4.0\\,\\mathrm{m}\nbetween them.\nFor each method and each gap width, we conduct 10 simulation runs. The comparison focuses on path length, total mission completion time, and success rate across different gap widths (defined as the minimum distance between the obstacles forming the passage), as indicated in Table\nII\n, where a run is counted as successful only if the robot reaches the goal without any collision. Baselines fail primarily due to geometric conservatism or optimization limitations in highly constrained scenarios. In this scenario, our method demonstrates strong performance without relying on any front-end planner to provide reference paths. For all simulations, we simply use the straight line from the start to the goal as reference, which is not collision-free, yet the optimizer is still able to deform it into collision-free trajectories that successfully navigate through the passages. The proposed trajectory planner maintains a replanning rate of around 13 Hz throughout the simulations.\nIV-A\n2\nForest\nIn this subsection, we further compare the performance of our proposed method against the three planners mentioned above in forest scenario. As illustrated in Fig.\n5\n, forest environment consists of closely arranged cylinder obstacles. We adopt this structured layout so that the difficulty of the environment can be controlled directly through the spacing\nd\nd\nbetween neighboring obstacles.\n(a)\nFigure 5:\nIllustration of the L-shaped robot navigating through the dense forest scenario via our proposed planner.\nThe RViz snapshots at four representative time instants (A, B, C, D) during execution illustrates how the separating hypersurfaces (yellow curves) function during trajectory optimization. When the robot’s non-convexity is not necessary for collision avoidance, the hypersurfaces naturally degenerates into simple separating hyperplanes.\nSimilar to the narrow-passage scenario, in the relatively relaxed forest settings with obstacle spacing\nd\n1\n=\n4.0\n​\nm\nd_{1}=4.0\\,\\mathrm{m}\nand\nd\n2\n=\n1.6\n​\nm\nd_{2}=1.6\\,\\mathrm{m}\n, our method relies only on a straight line from the start to the goal as the reference path and still achieves strong performance. For the most constrained case\nd\n3\n=\n1.4\n​\nm\nd_{3}=1.4\\,\\mathrm{m}\n, we additionally provide a coarse reference path generated by an RRT* planner in OMPL\n[\n18\n]\n, and our optimizer refines this path into a smooth, collision-free trajectory.\nIn the forest experiments, we distinguish between task completion and safety. A run is considered complete if the robot reaches the goal within a reasonable time, regardless of whether collisions occur. Safety is then evaluated separately by reporting whether the corresponding trajectories are collision-free. To account for different task scales, we additionally report the ratio between the executed path length and the straight-line distance from the start to the goal, which provides a normalized measure of path efficiency.\nFigure 6:\nIllustration of the trajectory of a robot with a complex non-convex shape navigating through a cluttered and narrow environment.\nTABLE III:\nComparison of key metrics for different trajectory planners in environments with varying forest densities.\nObstacle Spacing\nMetric\nOurs\nFASTER\nDDR-OPT\nHyperplane\nd\n1\n=\n4.0\nd_{1}=4.0\nm\nPath Ratio\n1.07\n1.30\n1.07\n1.12\nTotal Time (s)\n60.39\n72.15\n64.63\n63.91\nCompl.

The comparison focuses on path efficiency, total completion time, task completion rate, and safety, as summarized in Table\nIII\n. The proposed method maintains strong obstacle-avoidance and traversal performance in dense forest environments. In the forest scenario, baseline methods mainly fail due to conservative approximations and the difficulty of solving online optimization problems in complex environments. In the simulations, our trajectory optimizer operates at a frequency around 10 Hz.\nIV-B\nReal-World Experiments\nTo verify the practical application of the proposed method, we conduct real-world experiments with the quadruped robot in Fig.\n3\n(b). We model the robot as a non-convex shape consisting of a rectangle coupled with an L-shape frame to account for its actual footprint.\nIn terms of experimental setup, we build a cluttered and narrow indoor environment, in which the quadruped robot must continuously adjust its posture to pass through narrow passages between obstacles. During the experiments, the robot has no prior knowledge of the environment and can only rely on the onboard MID-360 LiDAR to perceive the surroundings, which provides real-time point clouds within a range of 3 m. A straight line from the start to the goal is used as the only reference trajectory.\nAs shown in Fig.\n6\nunder the Bird’s Eye View (BEV), the robot successfully reaches the goal by following the collision-free trajectory generated by the online optimizer, which runs at an execution frequency of about 12 Hz throughout the motion.\nFigure 7:\nDemonstration of real-time replanning in a changing cluttered environment.\n(a) The quadruped robot with a non-convex footprint encounters a dead end and stops.\n(b) An obstacle is manually removed to create a narrow passage.\n(c) The proposed planner performs real-time trajectory replanning and guides the robot through the newly opened passage.\n(d) The robot successfully traverses the passage and reaches the goal.\nWe further perform additional online replanning experiments to showcase the real-time capability of the proposed algorithm. As illustrated in Fig.\n7\n(a)-\n7\n(d), the robot initially follows the given straight-line reference trajectory until it encounters a dead end and comes to a stop. At this point, one obstacle is manually removed, creating a narrow passage within the robot’s observable range. Using the updated map, the robot detects this new passage and replans its trajectory online, eventually reaching the goal.\nThe proposed method demonstrates a reliable real-time trajectory optimization capability for robots with non-convex shapes operating in cluttered and narrow environments, and exhibits excellent robustness in real-world experiments.\nV\nConclusion\nIn this letter, we propose a separating hypersurface-based collision evaluation method designed for the trajectory optimization of mobile robots with arbitrary shapes. This method serves as a generalization of the classical separating hyperplane approach, extending its applicability to non-convex geometries. We then develop a comprehensive optimization formulation and integrate it into an online planner, where the obstacles are modeled from real-time point cloud measurements via clustering and specialized sampling. The proposed planner has been extensively validated through both simulations and real-world experiments. Results demonstrate its capability to operate in real-time with non-convex robot geometries and to generate efficient, collision-free trajectories in cluttered and narrow environments. The planner exhibits strong robustness in unknown environments, relying solely on local perception without prior maps. Furthermore, even when initialized with naive or infeasible straight-line references, the planner consistently yields safe and smooth motions. These results highlight the effectiveness and generality of our approach for safe and reliable motion planning in cluttered and narrow environments.\nReferences\n[1]\nJ. A. Andersson, J. Gillis, G.

  "preview_text": "An emerging class of trajectory optimization methods enforces collision avoidance by jointly optimizing the robot's configuration and a separating hyperplane. However, as linear separators only apply to convex sets, these methods require convex approximations of both the robot and obstacles, which becomes an overly conservative assumption in cluttered and narrow environments. In this work, we unequivocally remove this limitation by introducing nonlinear separating hypersurfaces parameterized by polynomial functions. We first generalize the classical separating hyperplane theorem and prove that any two disjoint bounded closed sets in Euclidean space can be separated by a polynomial hypersurface, serving as the theoretical foundation for nonlinear separation of arbitrary geometries. Building on this result, we formulate a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem that jointly optimizes the robot's trajectory and the coefficients of the separating polynomials, enabling geometry-aware collision avoidance without conservative convex simplifications. The optimization remains efficiently solvable using standard NLP solvers. Simulation and real-world experiments with nonconvex robots demonstrate that our method achieves smooth, collision-free, and agile maneuvers in environments where convex-approximation baselines fail.\n\nOnline Trajectory Optimization for Arbitrary-Shaped Mobile Robots via Polynomial Separating Hypersurfaces\nShuoye Li, Zhiyuan Song, Yulin Li, Zhihai Bi, and Jun Ma\nShuoye Li, Zhiyuan Song, Yulin Li, Zhihai Bi, and Jun Ma are with the Robotics and Autonomous Systems Thrust, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), Guangzhou 511453, China (e-mail: sli610@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn; zsong142@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn; zbi217@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn; yline@connect.ust.hk; jun.ma@ust.hk).\nAbstract\nAn emerging class of trajectory optimization methods enforces collision avoidance by jointly optimizing the robot’s configuration and a separating hyperpla",
