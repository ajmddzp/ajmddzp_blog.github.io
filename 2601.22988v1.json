limitations:\n(i) reliance on multi-view observations during inference, which is impractical in single-view restricted scenarios;\n(ii) incomplete scene modeling that fails to capture holistic and fine-grained geometric structures essential for precise manipulation; and\n(iii) lack of effective policy training strategies to retain and exploit the acquired 3D knowledge.\nTo address these

manipulation.\n1\nIntroduction\nLearning end-to-end visuomotor policies enables robots to perceive their surroundings and act upon visual understanding\n[\n3\n,\n18\n,\n4\n,\n12\n,\n45\n,\n9\n,\n11\n]\n.\nHowever, real-world environments are often spatially complex and partially occluded, with varying camera viewpoints.\nTherefore, learning spatially grounded and view-invariant visual representations is essential for developing robust visuomotor policies.\nMost existing approaches\n[\n41\n,\n19\n,\n10\n]\nemploy 2D visual encoders to compress images into latent vectors that capture task-relevant states.\nHowever, such 2D features lack explicit 3D structural awareness, limiting their effectiveness in spatially intricate manipulation tasks.\nRecent studies have attempted to address this limitation by leveraging multi-view inputs to learn 3D-aware visual representations\n[\n7\n,\n28\n,\n32\n]\n.\nWhile promising, such methods are often impractical for real-world deployment due to hardware constraints and inference overhead.\nMore recent efforts\n[\n6\n,\n37\n,\n23\n,\n43\n,\n44\n]\nintroduce single-view 3D perception by incorporating auxiliary reconstruction objectives such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs)\n[\n24\n]\nor Gaussian Splatting\n[\n17\n]\n.\nAlthough these methods enhance 3D understanding, their scene modeling remains coarse, often failing to recover fine-grained geometric structures that are crucial for precise manipulation (as shown in\nFig.\n˜\n1\n).\nMoreover, the resulting visual encoders tend to overfit to specific training viewpoints, leading to degraded generalization in unseen configurations during inference.\nTo learn more expressive 3D manipulation representations with high-fidelity scene embeddings and strong generalization across varying camera viewpoints, we propose\nGEM3D\n(\nGe\no\nm\netrically-Grounded\n3D\nManipulation), a unified representation-policy learning framework that leverages geometrically-grounded 3D representation pretraining on multi-view data and distills the acquired geometric knowledge into a single-view visual policy for downstream robotic manipulation tasks.\nGEM3D\nadopts a three-stage pretraining paradigm to learn expressive 3D scene embeddings:\n(i)\nFrom single-view RGB-D observations, the model encodes the input into a voxel-based\nDense Volumetric Feature\n.\n(ii)\nThis volumetric representation is then used to predict skeleton seed points, which are progressively refined into complete point structures via a coarse-to-fine Snowflake process\n[\n38\n]\n, enabling holistic geometric understanding.\n(iii)\nGuided by the refined points, the\nDense Volumetric Feature\nis resampled to predict Gaussian primitives for novel-view rendering under multi-view supervision, capturing fine-grained appearance and texture details.\nThrough this pretraining paradigm,\nGEM3D\nlearns to infer the complete geometry and appearance of a scene from single-view inputs, thereby achieving robust scene understanding and strong view-generalization.\nBeyond the generalizable\nDense Volumetric Feature\n, developing a robust policy that fully retains the scene understanding capability acquired during pretraining is equally crucial.\nTo this end, we propose a multi-step distillation-based visuomotor policy that can integrate with any pretrained representations, featuring an implicit dynamics-aware design that enhances perception-action consistency.\nRather than directly fine-tuning the pretrained encoder,\nGEM3D\nsoftly guides the policy’s visual encoder training by aligning its latent features with the pretrained representations, effectively transferring the acquired geometric understanding to manipulation skills.\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of\nGEM3D\n, we conduct comprehensive experiments on 12 RLBench manipulation tasks\n[\n16\n]\n.\nGEM3D\nachieves a\n12.7%\nimprovement in average success rate over the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method ManiGaussian\n[\n23\n]\n.\nIt also demonstrates strong zero-shot view generalization, with success rates dropping by only\n22.03%\nand\n29.67%\nunder moderate and large viewpoint shifts, compared to the SOTA method’s\n41.62%\nand\n51.52%\ndeclines.\nIn addition, integrating our distillation-based policy with ManiGaussan-Pretrained representation backbones yields consistent performance gains, indicating its potential for diversified extension to a broader range of backbone architectures.\nAblation studies further verify the necessity of each component in our framework.\nFigure 2\n:\nOverview of\nGEM3D\n.\nGEM3D\ncomprises two key components:\n(1)\nGEM3D Pretraining\n, which learns holistic 3D representations through auxiliary scene reconstruction tasks; and\n(2)\nGEM3D Policy\n, which distills the pretrained 3D visual representations into a visuomotor policy for view-generalizable manipulation.\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\n3D Representation Learning\nRecent advances in visuomotor policy learning have explored diverse representation forms, ranging from 2D image features\n[\n3\n,\n30\n]\nto 3D structures such as voxel grids\n[\n33\n]\nand point clouds\n[\n2\n,\n8\n,\n44\n]\n.\nAmong these, novel view synthesis (NVS) has recently gained attention as an auxiliary representation learning objective, as it enables models to infer unseen viewpoints from limited observations—reflecting a holistic understanding of 3D geometry and spatial consistency\n[\n24\n,\n17\n,\n27\n,\n22\n,\n31\n]\n.\nHowever, achieving accurate and generalizable reconstruction remains challenging for existing NVS paradigms.\nClassical methods such as NeRFs\n[\n24\n]\nand Gaussian Splatting\n[\n17\n]\noften struggle to generalize beyond the training distribution, leading to degraded rendering quality in novel scenes or viewpoints.\nMore recent feed-forward Gaussian Splatting approaches—ImageSplatter\n[\n34\n]\n, VoxSplat\n[\n29\n]\n, and PixelSplat\n[\n1\n]\n—improve generalization but remain unstable in dynamic environments, exhibiting noticeable degradation in reconstructed geometry and texture (see\nFig.\n˜\n1\n).\nThese limitations highlight the need for a NVS framework that achieves both high-fidelity reconstruction and robust generalization across diverse robotic scenes.\n2.2\nVisuomotor Policy Learning\nTo effectively leverage the benefits of auxiliary representation learning tasks, recent visuomotor policy research can be categorized into two major training paradigms:\n(i)\nPretrain-Finetune\n.\nThese methods leverage visual encoders that are pretrained on large-scale 2D or 3D perception datasets and subsequently finetuned for downstream control tasks\n[\n39\n,\n36\n,\n40\n,\n42\n,\n28\n]\n.\nHowever, domain discrepancies between pretraining and downstream control tasks can lead to suboptimal transfer, and even degrade policy learning, as observed in\n[\n13\n,\n14\n]\n.\n(ii)\nJoint-Training\n.\nThis paradigm jointly optimizes visuomotor policies with auxiliary representation objectives, such as NVS\n[\n43\n,\n23\n]\n.\nYet, the optimization tends to be imbalanced: the representation gains little from auxiliary tasks, while the policy overfits to training viewpoints and generalizes poorly to unseen camera poses.\nIn contrast to prior works, we propose a multi-step distillation framework that softly guides the policy encoder training with pretrained 3D representations, effectively preserving geometric knowledge acquired during pretraining.\n3\nMethod\nOur goal is to learn a voxel-based 3D visual representation through pretraining and subsequently distill the acquired 3D knowledge into a visuomotor policy for view-generalizable robotic manipulation.\nIn the following, we outline the overall framework of\nGEM3D\n.\nSec.\n˜\n3.1\ndetails the pretraining pipeline and\nSec.\n˜\n3.2\npresents the policy learning strategy.\nAn overview is shown in\nFig.\n˜\n2\n.\n3.1\nGeometrically-Grounded Pretraining\nFigure 3\n:\nGEM3D\nPretraining Pipeline.\n(a)\nencoding single-view RGB-D observations into volumetric features,\n(b)\nprogressively reconstructing scene geometry in a coarse-to-fine Snowflake\n[\n38\n]\nmanner, and\n(c)\nlearning fine-grained texture details through Gaussian-splatting-based novel view rendering.\nGEM3D\n’s pretraining pipeline consists of three main components:\n(i) a\n3D Feature Extraction\nmodule that encodes single-view RGB-D observations into\ndense volumetric features\n;\n(ii) a\nPoint Cloud Reconstruction\nobjective that learns holistic 3D scene geometry; and\n(iii) a\nFeed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting\nmodule that captures fine-grained texture through multi-view supervision.\nThe detailed pipeline is illustrated in\nFig.\n˜\n3\n.\n3.1.1\n3D Feature Extraction\nAs shown in\nFig.\n˜\n3\na, the feature extraction module takes a single-view RGB-D input\no\nt\n=\n{\nℐ\nt\n,\n𝒟\nt\n,\n𝒦\nt\n}\no^{t}=\\{\\mathcal{I}^{t},\\mathcal{D}^{t},\\mathcal{K}^{t}\\}\nand processes it as follows:\n•\nThe depth map\n𝒟\nt\n\\mathcal{D}^{t}\nis back-projected using the camera parameters\n𝒦\nt\n\\mathcal{K}^{t}\n, followed by cropping and farthest point sampling to obtain the point cloud\n𝒫\n\\mathcal{P}\n.\n•\nThe RGB image\nℐ\nt\n\\mathcal{I}^{t}\nis encoded by a pretrained DINOv2\n[\n25\n]\nmodel to extract pixel-wise 2D features\nℱ\n2D\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\text{2D}}\n, which are then projected onto\n𝒫\n\\mathcal{P}\nto enrich the point cloud with visual semantics.\n•\nThe resulting semantically enriched point cloud is voxelized into occupancy and feature volumes, which are subsequently fused through a 3D U-Net\n[\n5\n]\nto produce the\nDense Volumetric Feature\nℱ\n∈\nℝ\nD\n3\n×\n128\n\\mathcal{F}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D^{3}\\times 128}\n, where\nD\nD\ndenotes the voxel resolution, and\n128\n128\ncorresponds to the feature dimension.\nThis process encodes the single-view RGB-D observation into a dense voxel-based 3D representation\nℱ\n\\mathcal{F}\nthat jointly captures geometric structure and visual semantics.\n3.1.2\nCoarse-to-Fine Point Cloud Reconstruction\nTo enable the\nholistic geometric understanding\nof the volumetric feature\nℱ\n\\mathcal{F}\n, we introduce a coarse-to-fine reconstruction module that first predicts sparse seed points and then progressively refines them into a dense point cloud (\nFig.\n˜\n3\nb).\nSeed Points Generation.\nTo capture the key structural points necessary for reconstructing the full scene, we initialize a\nlearnable voxel query set\n𝒬\n∈\nℝ\nd\n3\n×\n128\n\\mathcal{Q}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d^{3}\\times 128}\n(with\nd\n≪\nD\nd\\ll D\nto reduce computational overhead) and apply a two-stage attention mechanism to aggregate multi-scale spatial features from the volumetric representation\nℱ\n\\mathcal{F}\n:\n•\nCoarse Cross-Attention\n:\nWe first downsample\nℱ\n\\mathcal{F}\nwith average pooling to obtain a low-resolution feature\nℱ\ndown\n∈\nℝ\nd\n3\n×\n128\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\text{down}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d^{3}\\times 128}\n, which only preserves the overall spatial structure of the scene.\nAnd then we perform cross-attention between\n𝒬\n\\mathcal{Q}\nand\nℱ\ndown\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\text{down}}\nto obtain\nproposal queries\n𝒬\np\n\\mathcal{Q}_{p}\nthat capture coarse spatial relationships.\n•\n3D Deformable Cross-Attention\n:\nTo further enrich\n𝒬\np\n\\mathcal{Q}_{p}\nwith fine-grained geometric cues, we apply a 3D deformable cross-attention module between\n𝒬\np\n\\mathcal{Q}_{p}\nand\nℱ\n\\mathcal{F}\n, following\n[\n46\n,\n20\n]\n.\nThis enables efficient aggregation of local geometric details from\nℱ\n\\mathcal{F}\nto the query features. Implementation details are provided in Appendix A.\nThis process yields a set of\nseed tokens\n, which are decoded by a shallow MLP to produce seed point coordinates\n𝒫\n^\n0\n∈\nℝ\nd\n3\n×\n3\n\\hat{\\mathcal{P}}_{0}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d^{3}\\times 3}\n.\nPoint Cloud Recovery.\nStarting from the seed points\n𝒫\n^\n0\n\\hat{\\mathcal{P}}_{0}\n, we follow the SnowflakeNet\n[\n38\n]\nand employ a\nSnowflake Point Deconvolution\n(SPD) block to progressively refine the point set.\nAt each stage\ni\ni\n:\n•\nThe parent points\n𝒫\n^\ni\n∈\nℝ\nN\ni\n×\n3\n\\hat{\\mathcal{P}}_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N_{i}\\times 3}\n(\nN\ni\nN_{i}\ndenotes the point number at stage\ni\ni\n) query the volumetric feature\nℱ\n\\mathcal{F}\nvia trilinear interpolation at their coordinates to obtain point features\nℱ\ni\n∈\nℝ\nN\ni\n×\n128\n\\mathcal{F}_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N_{i}\\times 128}\n.\n•\nGiven\n𝒫\n^\ni\n\\hat{\\mathcal{P}}_{i}\n,\nℱ\ni\n\\mathcal{F}_{i}\nand current context features\nℱ\ni\nc\n\\mathcal{F}^{\\text{c}}_{i}\n(\nthe intermediate output of the previous SPD stage, omitted for the first iteration)\nas input, the SPD block upsamples each point by a factor of\nr\nr\n, producing\nr\nr\ndisplacement vectors for each parent point\nΔ\n​\n𝒫\ni\n∈\nℝ\nr\n×\nN\ni\n×\n3\n\\Delta\\mathcal{P}_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{r\\times N_{i}\\times 3}\nand outputs the updated context features\nℱ\ni\n+\n1\nc\n\\mathcal{F}^{\\text{c}}_{i+1}\n.\n•\nEach parent point is duplicated\nr\nr\ntimes and displaced by the predicted offsets\nΔ\n​\n𝒫\ni\n\\Delta\\mathcal{P}_{i}\nto form the refined child points\n𝒫\n^\ni\n+\n1\n∈\nℝ\nN\ni\n+\n1\n×\n3\n\\hat{\\mathcal{P}}_{i+1}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N_{i+1}\\times 3}\n, where\nN\ni\n+\n1\n=\nr\n×\nN\ni\nN_{i+1}=r\\times N_{i}\n.\nTo supervise reconstruction with holistic scene geometry, we fuse multi-view ground-truth point clouds into a complete set\n𝒫\nfull\n\\mathcal{P}_{\\text{full}}\n.\nAt each refinement stage\ni\ni\n, we use farthest point sampling to sample a subset\n𝒫\ni\n⊂\n𝒫\nfull\n\\mathcal{P}_{i}\\subset\\mathcal{P}_{\\text{full}}\nwith a size comparable to that of the predicted set\n𝒫\n^\ni\n\\hat{\\mathcal{P}}_{i}\n, and supervise the refinement using the\nChamfer distance\nL\n2\nL_{2}\n:\nℒ\nrec\n=\n∑\ni\n=\n0\n3\n(\n\\displaystyle\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{rec}}=\\sum_{i=0}^{3}\\Bigg(\n1\n|\n𝒫\n^\ni\n|\n​\n∑\n𝐩\n^\n∈\n𝒫\n^\ni\nmin\n𝐩\n∈\n𝒫\ni\n⁡\n‖\n𝐩\n^\n−\n𝐩\n‖\n2\n2\n\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{|\\hat{\\mathcal{P}}_{i}|}\\sum_{\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}\\in\\hat{\\mathcal{P}}_{i}}\\min_{\\mathbf{p}\\in\\mathcal{P}_{i}}\\|\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}-\\mathbf{p}\\|_{2}^{2}\n(1)\n+\n1\n|\n𝒫\ni\n|\n∑\n𝐩\n∈\n𝒫\ni\nmin\n𝐩\n^\n∈\n𝒫\n^\ni\n∥\n𝐩\n−\n𝐩\n^\n∥\n2\n2\n)\n\\displaystyle+\\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{P}_{i}|}\\sum_{\\mathbf{p}\\in\\mathcal{P}_{i}}\\min_{\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}\\in\\hat{\\mathcal{P}}_{i}}\\|\\mathbf{p}-\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}\\|_{2}^{2}\\Bigg)\n3.1.3\nFeed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting\nBased on the reconstructed dense point cloud\n𝒫\n^\n\\hat{\\mathcal{P}}\n,\nwe further integrate a feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting pipeline that performs novel-view rendering and\ncaptures fine-grained texture details\nunder multi-view supervision.

To mitigate overfitting, checkpoints at both 80% and the final training step are evaluated, and the better result per seed is selected. Each seed is tested on 100 different settings per task, including 178 variations in language, object position, and color. We report the mean and standard deviation of SR across all seeds.\nTo assess view generalization, we perform zero-shot evaluations under three levels of camera viewpoint shifts (as shown in\nFig.\n˜\n5(b)\n):\n•\nNo Shift:\nSame viewpoint as training.\n•\nModerate Shift:\nCamera relocated within\n30\n∘\n30^{\\circ}\naround the robot base.\n•\nLarge Shift:\nSignificant viewpoint variations between\n60\n∘\n60^{\\circ}\nand\n90\n∘\n90^{\\circ}\n.\nBaselines.\nWe adopt\nPerceiverIO\n[\n15\n]\nas our policy backbone for its simplicity and compatibility with discrete token-based input-output representations.\nFor fair comparison, we consider prior methods that also employ the PerceiverIO architecture as their policy backbone, including:\n(i)\nPerAct\n[\n33\n]\n, which directly utilizes voxel-based 3D representations;\n(ii)\nGNFActor\n[\n43\n]\n, which incorporates NeRFs as an auxiliary representation learning objective; and\n(iii)\nManiGaussian\n[\n23\n]\n, which leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting for representation learning and jointly trains it with the policy.\nTo further assess our distillation-based policy learning framework, we pair the ManiGaussian representation module with our training strategy, denoted as (iv)\nManiGaussian (w Distill)\n, and additionally compare its pretraining quality against\nGEM3D\n.\nImplementation details.\nWe apply SE(3) augmentations to the input point cloud following prior works\n[\n33\n,\n35\n]\n.\nGEM3D\nis pretrained for 100K iterations on two NVIDIA RTX3090 GPUs, taking approximately four to five days.\nEach policy is then trained for 12K iterations on a single RTX3090 GPU, requiring about three to four hours per task.\nAdditional implementation and experimental setup details are provided in the Appendix B.\n4.2\nExperimental Results\n4.2.1\nComparison with State-of-the-Art Methods\nWe compare\nGEM3D\nwith baseline methods on 12 RLBench tasks, with each model trained independently per task.\nThe results are shown in\nTab.\n˜\n1\n,\nGEM3D\nachieves the highest overall performance, attaining an average success rate of\n44.2%\nand an absolute gain of\n12.7%\nover\nManiGaussian\n, the previous State-of-the-Art (SOTA) method.\nFurthermore,\nTab.\n˜\n2\nreports the zero-shot success rates under varying degrees of viewpoint shifts on six representative tasks, together with the relative performance drop compared to the training view.\nGEM3D\nexhibits only\n22.03%\nand\n29.67%\ndeclines under\nmoderate\nand\nlarge\nshifts, respectively—significantly lower than the\n41.62%\nand\n51.52%\ndrops observed in\nManiGaussian\n.\nUnder large viewpoint shifts, our method achieves up to\n6\n×\n\\times\nhigher success rates than\nPerAct\n(see\nFig.\n˜\n1\n).\nNotably, although the distilled variant\nManiGaussian (w distill)\nshows slightly improved robustness over its original version, its performance remains far below that of\nGEM3D\n.\nThis suggests that while our distillation-based policy training helps mitigate performance degradation under unseen viewpoint shifts, holistic 3D representation learning through stronger pretraining is the key to achieving view-generalizable visuomotor policies.\nTable 2\n:\nResult of zero-shot view generalization on six RLBench tasks under two view-shift settings (SR%).\nBold\nnumbers denote the best performance,

that our geometrically grounded representation also facilitates clearer task distinction and more reliable instruction following.\nFurther explanations of task selection and per-task results are

Analysis of Scene Reconstruction\nHigh-fidelity scene reconstruction serves as a strong indicator of a model’s grasp of 3D geometry and appearance. As illustrated in\nFig.\n˜\n1\n, our method reconstructs sharper structures and produces more consistent novel views, while\nManiGaussian\nsuffers from blurred textures and geometric distortions. These results highlight that our geometrically grounded 3D representations yield a more holistic and viewpoint-robust understanding of the scene.\nTable 4\n:\nComparison of scene reconstruction quality.\nLarger PSNR and SSIM indicate better image fidelity, while lower Chamfer\nL\n2\nL_{2}\nindicates higher point cloud geometric accuracy.\nMethods\nTasks\nPSNR\n↑\n\\uparrow\nSSIM\n↑\n\\uparrow\nChamfer\nL\n2\nL_{2}\n↓\n\\downarrow\nManiGaussian\nOpen Drawer\n16.24\n0.3926\n0.04035\nTurn Tap\n15.84\n0.3741\n0.05148\nWater Plants\n16.07\n0.3846\n0.04352\nAvg\n16.05\n0.3838\n0.04511\nGEM3D\n(ours)\nOpen Drawer\n23.54\n0.8259\n0.01541\nTurn Tap\n22.92\n0.8123\n0.01708\nWater Plants\n22.93\n0.8025\n0.01613\nAvg\n23.13\n0.8136\n0.01621\nFurthermore, we report quantitative metrics for the three scenes in\nFig.\n˜\n1\n(see\nTab.\n˜\n4\n), including\nPSNR\nand\nSSIM\nfor image quality and\nChamfer L2\nfor geometric accuracy.\nGEM3D Pretraining\nconsistently outperforms the pretraining method of\nManiGaussian\n, achieving average improvements of +7.08 dB in PSNR, +0.4298 in SSIM, and –0.0289 in Chamfer\nL\n2\nL_{2}\n, demonstrating its stronger ability to capture both visual fidelity and geometric consistency.\n4.3\nAblations\n4.3.1\nAblation on GEM3D Pretraining\nIn our\nGEM3D Pretraining\nmodule, we highlight three essential designs that jointly enhance geometric reconstruction and texture rendering:\n•\nDeformable cross-attention (DCA)\nensures efficient and precise seed generation while preserving spatial integrity.\n•\nSnowflake-style coarse-to-fine reconstruction\nexpands and refines point sets over three upsampling stages, yielding progressively denser geometric structures.\n•\nFocal loss\nemphasizes supervision on dynamic and ambiguous regions, enhancing robustness to motion-induced appearance and geometry changes.\nWe demonstrate the importance of these components through qualitative ablations (see\nFig.\n˜\n6\n).\n(i) In the\nw/o DCA\nvariant, deformable cross-attention is replaced with standard cross-attention between dense and downsampled volumetric features, leading to the loss of fine spatial cues.\n(ii) The\nw/o snowflake\nvariant adopts a single-step reconstruction, preventing the model from progressively refining geometric details.\n(iii) The\nw/o focal loss\nsetting replaces focal loss with a plain MSE objective for Gaussian rendering, reducing supervisory emphasis on dynamic or ambiguous regions.\nAcross all cases, removing any individual component results in clear degradation—robot arms collapse, complex plant structures fail to reconstruct, and texture consistency deteriorates—highlighting the essential role each module plays in the overall design.\nFigure 6\n:\nQualitative ablation on\nGEM3D Pretraining\ndesigns\n4.3.2\nAblation on the Number of Pretraining Viewpoints\nIn our experiments, we use multi-view observations from eight surrounding cameras for pretraining. While effective, this configuration is often impractical in real-world deployment. To evaluate the dependence on view count, we vary the number of pretraining views and conduct multi-task training on\nPhone on Base\n,\nMeat on Grill\n, and\nTurn Tap\n.\nTab.\n˜\n5\nsummarizes the average success rates under different view settings, including a “0-view” setting where the\nFeed-forward Gaussian Splatting Rendering\nmodule is disabled.\nTable 5\n:\nAblations on pretraining viewpoint numbers (SR%).\nModules\nTrain View\nModerate Shift\nLarge Shift\nTrain View\nNumbers\n8\n58.8\n±\n\\pm\n6.0\n45.9\n±\n\\pm\n8.4\n39.6\n±\n\\pm\n8.5\n4\n54.6\n±\n\\pm\n4.9\n42.4\n±\n\\pm\n6.6\n37.3\n±\n\\pm\n8.8\n2\n54.9\n±\n\\pm\n5.1\n40.3\n±\n\\pm\n5.1\n33.6\n±\n\\pm\n6.8\nw/o gaussian\nsplatting\n47.2\n±\n\\pm\n7.4\n33.4\n±\n\\pm\n6.1\n30.8\n±\n\\pm\n5.8\nWe observe that\nGEM3D Pretraining\nis largely insensitive to the number of available views: reducing the pretraining setup from eight to two cameras leads to only marginal declines in success rates across all viewpoint conditions. In contrast, removing the Gaussian Splatting module yields a pronounced performance drop\nof nearly 10%. This indicates that Gaussian Splatting not only captures fine-grained appearance details but also enforces spatial consistency across viewpoints, enabling strong performance even under limited multi-view supervision.\n4.3.3\nAblation on GEM3D Policy\nIn this section, we perform an ablation study on the effectiveness of the\nGEM3D Policy\narchitecture. Under the same experimental setup as Sec.\n4.3.2\n, we compare two variants:\n•\nSingle-step Distillation\n: Representation alignment is applied only at the input token level, with the\nt\n+\n1\nt{+}1\nlatent distillation step removed from the multi-step pipeline.\n•\nPretrain-Finetune\n: A conventional baseline where the pretrained encoder is directly fine-tuned on downstream tasks without distillation.\nTab.\n˜\n6\nreports the average success rates across three tasks.\nThe results indicate that incorporating distillation at the\nt\n+\n1\nt{+}1\nstep improves temporal consistency in the latent dynamics, leading to noticeably stronger policy performance.\nIn contrast, the conventional pretrain-finetune paradigm suffers from representation drift caused by the domain gap between pretraining and downstream tasks\n[\n13\n,\n26\n]\n, resulting in substantially reduced manipulation success.\nTable 6\n:\nAblations on\nGEM3D\npolicy training (SR%).\nMethods\nTrain View\nModerate Shift\nLarge Shift\nPretrain-Finetune\n32.2\n±\n\\pm\n11.1\n21.1\n±\n\\pm\n6.7\n15.1\n±\n\\pm\n6.8\nSingle-step Distillation\n54.6\n±\n\\pm\n7.6\n41.7\n±\n\\pm\n9.0\n37.7\n±\n\\pm\n8.7\nGEM3D\n(ours)\n58.0\n±\n\\pm\n6.0\n45.9\n±\n\\pm\n8.4\n39.6\n±\n\\pm\n8.5\n5\nConclusion\nWe introduce\nGEM3D\n, a unified representation-policy learning framework that substantially improves view-generalizable robotic manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.\nWe expect this study to motivate future efforts in two directions:\n(i) advancing large-scale 3D pretraining with broader object collections, with the goal of learning more universal and transferable representations, and\n(ii) integrating distillation-based policy learning with other types of pretrained representations to learn various forms of manipulation skills.\nReferences\n[1]\nD.

Therefore, we first\ncrop\nthe raw point cloud and apply\nfarthest point sampling (FPS)\nto regulate its spatial density and unify the number of points (\nNote:\nthe purpose of downsampling the point cloud to a unified number is to facilitate multi-batch parallel training\n). The processed point cloud is denoted as\n𝒫\n\\mathcal{P}\n.\nHowever, point cloud representation is inherently unstructured, making global reconstruction and compeletion of occlusion part difficult to perform. To alleviate this issue, we introduce a dense volumetric intermediate representation. Specifically, each point in\n𝒫\n\\mathcal{P}\nis assigned color information by associating it with the corresponding RGB pixel and the feature map extracted from the DinoV2. These two 3D point cloud representations are then jointly voxelized to yield volumetric observation, namingly\n3D Occupancy Map\nand\n3D Feature Map\n(see\nFig.\n˜\n1\n).\nFigure 1\n:\nVolumetric observation of the Single-view input\no\nt\no^{t}\n.

weights\nA\nk\n​\n(\n𝐪\np\n)\nA_{k}(\\mathbf{q}_{p})\nare computed to aggregate local geometric information.\nThe refined token feature, referred to as the\nseed token\n, is obtained as:\nDCA\n​\n(\n𝐪\np\n,\nℱ\n)\n=\n1\nN\np\n​\n∑\nk\n=\n1\nN\np\nA\nk\n​\n(\n𝐪\np\n)\n​\nℱ\n​\n(\n𝐩\n0\n+\nΔ\n​\n𝐩\nk\n​\n(\n𝐪\np\n)\n)\n.\n\\text{DCA}(\\mathbf{q}_{p},\\mathcal{F})=\\frac{1}{N_{p}}\\sum_{k=1}^{N_{p}}A_{k}(\\mathbf{q}_{p})\\,\\mathcal{F}(\\mathbf{p}_{0}+\\Delta\\mathbf{p}_{k}(\\mathbf{q}_{p})).\n(3)\nTo

guiding attention toward geometrically relevant locations.\nA.3\nTraning Details\nA.3.1\nTraning Details for\nGEM3D Pretraining\nTraining on robotic scenes with extremely large variance is inherently challenging. In the ablation study (Fig. 6 in the main paper), we have visually demonstrated the\nGEM3D Pretraining\nmodule that influence reconstruction and rendering quality.\nBut in practice, we additionally adopt several training techniques that are admittedly heuristic but not novel enough to be presented as core contributions in the main paper. However, these strategies are essential for stable reconstruction. In particular, in order to enable\nGEM3D Pretraining\nto perform feed-forward Gaussian splatting, we employ a series of optimization strategies that are substantially different from traditional 3D Gaussian Splatting. We summarize our key practical insights as follows:\n•\nStage-wise decoupled reconstruction and rendering.\nPrevious works have pointed out that the quality of Gaussian splatting reconstruction heavily depends on the initialization of point positions. Conventional 3D Gaussian Splatting often relies on Gaussian point cloud initialized from COLMAP. Similarly, during training, the rendering stage (c) strongly depends on the reconstruction quality of stage (b), especially when both modules share the same feature representation\nℱ\n\\mathcal{F}\nto simultaneously solve two related but distinct tasks: geometry reconstruction and novel view synthesis.\nIf novel view rendering is enforced too early while the reconstruction quality is still poor, the gradients from stage (c) may negatively interfere with the learning of\nℱ\n\\mathcal{F}\n, leading to unstable convergence and even complete collapse of the reconstructed scene. Therefore, during the first\nδ\n\\delta\ntraining iterations\n, we exclusively optimize the reconstruction objective of stage (b) and completely disable the rendering module (c). Only after reliable geometric and appearance-consistent point clouds can be recovered from\nℱ\n\\mathcal{F}\ndo we enable stage (c) and allow gradients from novel-view rendering to be back-propagated. This strategy provides a stable geometric prior for subsequent Gaussian splatting.\n•\nMulti-step iterative reconstruction per scene.\nA fundamental difference between feed-forward Gaussian splatting and traditional optimization-based splatting lies in the need for strong cross-scene generalization. In the early training phase, directly switching to a new scene after a single gradient update often leads to reconstruction failure due to large scene variance.\nTo mitigate this issue, we perform\nk\nconsecutive optimization steps\non the same scene before switching to the next one. As training progresses and the model becomes more stable, we gradually decrease\nk\nk\nuntil it eventually becomes\n1\n1\n, corresponding to standard single-step updates per scene.\nA.3.2\nTraning Strategy for\nGEM3D Policy\nDuring policy learning, imitation is performed from human demonstrations.\nHowever, raw trajectories often contain redundant intermediate states (e.g., gripper approaching motions).\nWe therefore select a sparse set of keyframes that correspond to interaction-critical states.\nGiven a demonstration trajectory\n𝒟\n=\n{\no\nt\n}\nt\n=\n1\nT\n,\n\\mathcal{D}=\\{o_{t}\\}_{t=1}^{T},\nwhere\ng\nt\n∈\n{\n0\n,\n1\n}\ng_{t}\\in\\{0,1\\}\ndenotes the gripper open/close state, a timestep\nt\nt\nis selected as a keyframe if\nt\n∈\n𝒦\n⟺\n(\ng\nt\n≠\ng\nt\n−\n1\n)\n∨\n(\nt\n=\nT\n)\n∨\nStopped\n​\n(\no\nt\n)\n,\nt\\in\\mathcal{K}\\;\\;\\Longleftrightarrow\\;\\;(g_{t}\\neq g_{t-1})\\;\\vee\\;(t=T)\\;\\vee\\;\\textsc{Stopped}(o_{t}),\n(6)\nwhere\nStopped\n​\n(\n⋅\n)\n\\textsc{Stopped}(\\cdot)\nindicates near-static motion under a small velocity threshold.\nRedundant adjacent keyframes are further removed.\nThis strategy significantly shortens the demonstration sequence while preserving states that are critical for object interaction.\nA.4\nParamters Details\nTable 1\n:\nKey Hyperparameters of\nGEM3D Pretraining\nParameters\nValue\ntrain.batch_size\n1\ntrain.learning_rate\n1.0\n×\n10\n−\n4\n1.0\\times 10^{-4}\ntrain.optimizer\ntorch.optim.AdamW\ntrain.steps\n100K\ntrain.num_views\n8\ntrain.\nδ\n\\delta\n40K\ntrain.\nk\nk\n[4, 3, 2, 1]\ntrain.demos\n50\nnetwork.\nD\nD\n100\nnetwork.\nd\nd\n[7,7,7]\nnetwork.fps_sample_num\n512\nnetwork.scene_bounds\n[-0.375,-0.5,0.6,1.0,0.5,1.6]\nTable 2\n:\nKey Hyperparameters of\nGEM3D Policy\nParameters\nValue\ntrain.batch_size\n1\ntrain.learning_rate\n1.0\n×\n10\n−\n4\n1.0\\times 10^{-4}\ntrain.optimizer\ntorch.optim.AdamW\ntrain.single_task_steps\n12K\ntrain.camera\n[front]\ntrain.demos\n20\nnetwork.scene_bounds\n[-0.375,-0.5,0.6,1.0,0.5,1.6]\nnetwork.num_tokens\n8000\nnetwork.num_latents\n2048\nnetwork.\nλ\nd\n​\ni\n​\ns\n​\nt\n​\ni\n​\nl\n​\nl\n\\lambda_{d}istill\n[1,0.5,0.3,0.2,0.1,0.05]\nB\nTasks Description\nWe selected 12 tasks from RLBench, which together contain 178 variations. See Fig.\n2\nand Table\n3\nfor detail description.\nFigure 2\n:\nRLBench tasks\n. 12 tasks of 9 scenes are selected.\nNotably, among these 12 tasks,\nclose jar\nand\nopen jar\n,\nmeat off grill\nand\nmeat on grill\n,\nput money in safe\nand\ntake money out safe\nbelong to the same scene but involve different action trajectories. Thus, these 12 tasks only cover 9 distinct scenes, and during pretraining, we only collected tasks from just 9 tasks to cover all of the scenes. This task design aims to evaluate the generalization capability of\nGEM3D\n.\nSpecifically, the trajectories for\nopen jar\n,\nmeat on grill\n, and\ntake money out safe\nwere not seen during pretraining. Nevertheless, Table 1 in the main paper demonstrates that\nGEM3D\nstill improves performance on these extrapolated tasks. Table 2 in main paper further shows that even for tasks with different trajectories within the same scene, our method enhances viewpoint generalization on extrapolated tasks. This indicates that although the pretrained model has not encountered new viewpoints in these tasks, single-view expert demonstrations during policy learning are sufficient to achieve significant improvements in novel viewpoints —it highlights that the pretrained representation effectively captures scene-level geometric features, enabling new skill adaptation and continual learning in real-world monocular system deployments.\nTable 3\n:\nTask Descriptions.\nThe 12 highly challenging tasks include a variety of random variations in color and layout, as well as multiple language instruction variations.\nTask\nType\nVariations\nInstruction Template\nClose Jar\ncolor\n20\n“close the _ jar”\nOpen Drawer\nplacement\n3\n“open the _ drawer”\nMeat off Grill\nsize\n2\n“take the _ off the grill”\nTurn Tap\ncategory\n2\n“turn _ tap”\nWater Plants\nplacement\n1\n“water plant”\nPhone on Base\nplacement\n1\n“put the phone on the base”\nPut Money in Safe\nplacement\n3\n“put the money away in the safe on the _ shelf”\nPlace Wine\nplacement\n1\n“stack wine bottle”\nStack Blocks\ncolor, count\n60\n“stack _ _ blocks”\nOpen Jar\ncolor\n80\n“open the _ jar”\nMeat on Grill\ncategory\n2\n“put the _ on the grill”\nTake Money out Safe\nplacement\n3\n“take the money out of the _ shelf and place it on the table.”\nC\nSupplementary of Experiments\nC.1\nAdditional Details of Manipulation Tasks\nTable 2 in the main paper reports results on six representative tasks. We further evaluate two additional heavily occluded tasks,\nopen drawer\nand\ntake money out safe\n, in Table\n4\n. We observe that performance drops more noticeably under viewpoint changes for these tasks, especially under the large-shift setting, where execution almost completely fails. This is because, under large shifts, one side of the scene is nearly entirely occluded (as shown in\nFig.\n˜\n3\n), leading to severe inconsistencies in visual representations across viewpoints, which the model cannot effectively resolve, ultimately causing execution collapse. It shows that\nGEM3D\nstill relies on the visibility of essential contact details during manipulation.\nFigure 3\n:\nopen drawer\nand\ntake money out safe\ntasks in large view shift\n.

    "preview_text": "Real-world robotic manipulation demands visuomotor policies capable of robust spatial scene understanding and strong generalization across diverse camera viewpoints. While recent advances in 3D-aware visual representations have shown promise, they still suffer from several key limitations, including reliance on multi-view observations during inference which is impractical in single-view restricted scenarios, incomplete scene modeling that fails to capture holistic and fine-grained geometric structures essential for precise manipulation, and lack of effective policy training strategies to retain and exploit the acquired 3D knowledge. To address these challenges, we present MethodName, a unified representation-policy learning framework for view-generalizable robotic manipulation. MethodName introduces a single-view 3D pretraining paradigm that leverages point cloud reconstruction and feed-forward gaussian splatting under multi-view supervision to learn holistic geometric representations. During policy learning, MethodName performs multi-step distillation to preserve the pretrained geometric understanding and effectively transfer it to manipulation skills. We conduct experiments on 12 RLBench tasks, where our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 12.7% in average success rate. Further evaluation on six representative tasks demonstrates strong zero-shot view generalization, with success rate drops of only 22.0% and 29.7% under moderate and large viewpoint shifts respectively, whereas the state-of-the-art method suffers larger decreases of 41.6% and 51.5%.\n\nLearning Geometrically-Grounded 3D Visual Representations\nfor View-Generalizable Robotic Manipulation\nDi Zhang\n1∗\nWeicheng Duan\n1∗\nDasen Gu\n1\nHongye Lu\n1\nHai Zhang\n2\nHang Yu\n1\nJunqiao Zhao\n1†\nGuang Chen\n1\n1\nTongji University\n2\nThe University of Hong Kong\nAbstract\n∗\nEqual contribution.

            "answer": "## GEM3D 的前作分析\n\n根据论文内容，GEM3D 的研究团队（主要来自同济大学和香港大学）在相关领域有持续的研究积累。论文中明确引用了团队之前的工作，并与其他近期方法进行了对比。以下表格详细梳理了其直接相关的“前作”（即团队先前发表的工作）以及作为主要对比基线的最新SOTA方法，并重点分析GEM3D与这些工作的区别与改进。\n\n### 主要相关前作与对比方法\n\n| 论文/方法 | 发表年份/出处 | 核心思想 | 与 GEM3D 的主要区别 | GEM3D 的主要改善与创新点 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **PerAct** <br> (Perceiver-Actor) | CoRL 2023 <br> (Shridhar et al.) | 使用体素化（voxel）的3D表示和PerceiverIO架构，直接从3D观察学习端到端操作策略。 | 1. **表示学习**：PerAct直接使用原始点云体素化后的特征，没有专门的3D几何预训练。<br>2. **视角泛化**：其3D表示对训练视角过拟合，在视角变化时性能下降严重。 | 1. **引入几何预训练**：GEM3D增加了**单视图3D几何预训练**阶段，通过点云重建和前馈高斯溅射学习**整体且细粒度的3D场景表示**，而PerAct没有此过程。<br>2. **更强的几何基础**：预训练使模型对场景的几何结构和外观有更深理解，从而在**零样本视角泛化**上表现远优于PerAct（大视角偏移下成功率下降仅29.7% vs. PerAct的79.9%）。 |\n| **GNFactor** | CoRL 2023 <br> (Ze et al.) | 将**神经辐射场（NeRF）** 作为辅助表示学习目标，与策略进行**联合训练**，以提升3D感知。 | 1. **3D表示技术**：使用NeRF进行新视角合成，其优化速度慢，且重建质量在动态场景中不稳定。<br>2. **训练范式**：采用联合训练，表示学习和策略学习可能相互干扰。 | 1. **更先进的3D表示**：GEM3D采用**前馈3D高斯溅射（Gaussian Splatting）**，相比NeRF，**渲染速度更快**，且通过精心设计的预训练能获得**更高保真度的几何和纹理**（PSNR平均提升7.08 dB）。<br>2. **解耦的训练框架**：采用**预训练+蒸馏**的两阶段框架，避免了联合训练的不稳定性，更好地保留了预训练中学到的几何知识。 |\n| **ManiGaussian** | arXiv 2024 <br> (Lu et al.) | 将**动态3D高斯溅射**作为表示学习目标，并与视觉运动策略进行**联合训练**，是GEM3D之前的SOTA方法。 | 1. **场景建模完整性**：ManiGaussian的联合训练导致场景建模**粗糙**，无法恢复对精细操作至关重要的细粒度几何结构（见图1对比）。<br>2. **知识保留**：联合训练中，策略学习会干扰3D表示的学习，导致学到的表示对训练视角过拟合，泛化能力弱。<br>3. **训练效率与稳定性**：联合训练需要平衡多个目标，优化更具挑战性。 | 1. **统一的预训练-策略框架**：GEM3D的核心创新是提出了**解耦但统一**的框架：先通过多视图监督进行**几何基础预训练**，再通过**多步蒸馏**将3D知识迁移到策略网络。这确保了学到的3D表示是**完整且视角不变的**。<br>2. **创新的预训练组件**：<br>   - **粗到细的点云重建**：使用Snowflake点反卷积，从稀疏种子点逐步细化出完整点云，实现**整体几何理解**。<br>   - **3D可变形交叉注意力**：高效聚合局部几何细节到查询特征，提升种子点生成质量。<br>   - **焦点损失（Focal Loss）**：在渲染中加强对动态和模糊区域的监督，提升对运动物体的重建鲁棒性。<br>3. **蒸馏策略设计**：提出**多步潜在蒸馏**，不仅对齐当前状态的潜在特征，还对齐预测的下一状态特征，增强了策略的**时序一致性**和动态理解能力。避免了直接微调导致的**表示漂移**问题。 |\n| **Zhang et al. (2024)** <br> “Focus on what matters...” | arXiv 2024 <br> (本文作者之一) | 专注于视觉RL泛化，提出了分离模型来处理不同层面的视觉变化。 | 1. **问题焦点**：该工作主要解决**视觉外观**（如纹理、光照）的泛化，而非**几何与视角**的泛化。<br>2. **表示形式**：未强调3D几何基础的显式学习。 | 1. **核心问题转移**：GEM3D将焦点从**2D外观泛化**转向**3D几何与视角泛化**，这是一个更根本且对机器人操作至关重要的挑战。<br>2. **技术路径不同**：GEM3D构建了全新的、基于几何重建和渲染的3D表示学习流水线，与之前工作的技术栈有显著区别。 |\n\n### 总结：GEM3D 相对于前作的突破\n\n1.  **从“联合训练”到“预训练-蒸馏”的范式转变**：针对ManiGaussian等联合训练方法存在的表示粗糙和过拟合问题，GEM3D创新性地采用了**分阶段学习**。先通过大量多视图数据（仅需采集，无需动作标签）学习一个强大的、视角不变的3D场景表示器，再通过**知识蒸馏**将其轻量化地迁移到单视图策略中。这既保留了丰富的3D先验，又保证了策略推理时的效率。\n\n2.  **从“粗糙3D”到“几何基础”的表示升级**：相比PerAct的简单体素特征和ManiGaussian/NeRF的不稳定重建，GEM3D的预训练模块通过**点云重建 + 高斯溅射渲染**的双重监督，学习到了** holistic（整体）且 fine-grained（细粒度）** 的几何表示。这体现在更高的新视角渲染质量（PSNR/SSIM）和更精确的点云重建（Chamfer距离更低）上，直接支撑了更精确的机械操作。\n\n3.  **针对视角泛化的系统性设计**：\n    - **预训练阶段**：利用多视图监督本质上是强制模型从单视图推理出完整3D场景，从而内在地学习了视角不变性。\n    - **策略阶段**：多步蒸馏损失（`L_distill`）确保了策略网络编码的视觉特征与预训练的几何特征空间对齐，即使输入视角变化，其语义和几何含义也保持一致。\n    - **结果**：在中等和大视角偏移下的零样本泛化性能下降**远小于**所有基线方法（下降率22.0%/29.7% vs. ManiGaussian的41.6%/51.5%），证明了其改进的有效性。\n\n4.  **模块化与可扩展性**：论文通过将ManiGaussian的表示模块与GEM3D的蒸馏策略结合（即“ManiGaussian (w Distill)”），验证了其蒸馏策略的通用性，能够提升其他3D表示骨干网络的性能。这为未来集成更强大的预训练模型奠定了基础。\n\n**总而言之，GEM3D的核心贡献在于构建了一个旨在从根本上解决机器人操作中视角泛化难题的框架。它通过引入一个深度几何预训练阶段和一种保守的知识迁移（蒸馏）策略，显著提升了3D视觉表示的完整性、鲁棒性和泛化能力，从而在多个复杂操作任务上实现了性能的飞跃。**",

            "answer": "## 论文主要局限性分析\n\n基于对论文内容的分析，**GEM3D** 框架虽然取得了显著的性能提升，但仍存在以下几个关键局限性：\n\n### 1. **对严重遮挡场景的鲁棒性不足**\n- **问题描述**：在视角发生**大范围偏移**（如 `60°-90°`）时，如果关键操作区域（如抽屉内部、保险箱内部）被严重遮挡，模型的性能会出现**显著下降**（如 `Open Drawer` 和 `Take Money out Safe` 任务在严重遮挡下成功率接近崩溃）。这表明模型仍依赖于**可见的接触细节**来进行操作。\n- **证据**：补充实验（附录表4）显示，在严重遮挡的“大偏移”设置下，某些任务的性能下降超过 `80%`。\n\n### 2. **预训练对多视角数据的依赖**\n- **问题描述**：尽管论文证明使用 `2` 个视角进行预训练仍能取得不错效果，但整个框架的起点仍是**多视角监督**。在真实世界中，获取密集、校准的多视角数据（尤其是动态机器人场景）成本高昂且不切实际。\n- **证据**：预训练阶段使用了 `8` 个环绕摄像头的数据进行监督。虽然消融实验表明减少视角数影响不大，但完全**零视角**（即不使用高斯溅射渲染模块）会导致性能显著下降近 `10%`。\n\n### 3. **计算开销与实时性挑战**\n- **问题描述**：框架包含**三阶段预训练**（体素特征提取、点云重建、高斯溅射渲染）和**多步蒸馏策略**，整体流程复杂。预训练需 `4-5` 天（2块GPU），策略训练需 `3-4` 小时/任务。这限制了其在需要快速部署或计算资源受限场景中的应用。\n- **证据**：方法部分详细描述了复杂的流水线，实验设置也明确了训练时间成本。\n\n### 4. **泛化能力仍受限于训练分布**\n- **问题描述**：\n    - **场景泛化**：所有实验均在 **RLBench 仿真环境**中进行，其物体、纹理和物理特性与真实世界存在差距。\n    - **任务泛化**：虽然进行了多任务评估，但任务均来自 `9` 个相似场景。模型对于**全新几何形状、全新物体类别或全新任务指令**的泛化能力尚未验证。\n- **证据**：实验仅限于 `12` 个 RLBench 任务，且多任务训练仅混合了 `4` 个任务的数据。\n\n### 5. **表征的“黑箱”特性**\n- **问题描述**：学习到的**密集体素特征**和蒸馏后的策略表征缺乏明确的、人类可解释的几何或语义结构。这给**错误诊断、安全性验证和模型调试**带来了困难。\n- **证据**：框架依赖于通过损失函数（Chamfer距离、Focal Loss、蒸馏损失）隐式地学习几何一致性，而非显式地重建语义分割或物体姿态。\n\n---\n\n## 未来可能的改进方向\n\n论文在结论和实验分析中已暗示了以下未来方向：\n\n### 1. **开发对遮挡更鲁棒的表征与策略**\n- **方向**：融合**主动感知**（如主动移动摄像头）或**物理常识**（如物体不可穿透性）来推理被遮挡部分的几何形状。\n- **方法**：结合**场景完成**或**4D动态场景建模**技术，从单视角或稀疏视角中预测被遮挡部分的持续状态。\n\n### 2. **迈向大规模3D预训练与更少监督**\n- **方向**：构建**大规模、多样化的3D物体与场景数据集**，进行预训练以学习更通用的3D先验。\n- **方法**：\n    - 利用互联网规模的**单目视频**或**无序图像集**进行自监督3D表征学习。\n    - 探索**零样本/少样本**的视角泛化方法，减少对密集多视角监督的依赖。\n\n### 3. **提升计算效率与部署可行性**\n- **方向**：简化框架，使其更适合**实时推理**和**边缘设备部署**。\n- **方法**：\n    - 设计更轻量的**3D特征编码器**（如稀疏体素、神经隐含场）。\n    - 研究**一次性**或**元学习**策略，加速对新任务和新视角的适应。\n\n### 4. **增强跨场景与跨形态的泛化能力**\n- **方向**：测试并提升模型在**真实机器人平台、复杂开放环境及多样化物体**上的性能。\n- **方法**：\n    - 在真实世界数据集上进行验证和微调。\n    - 结合**语言-视觉大模型**的语义先验，实现基于自然语言指令的零样本操作泛化。\n\n### 5. **提高系统的可解释性与可靠性**\n- **方向**：使学习到的3D表征和决策过程更加**透明和可解释**。\n- **方法**：\n    - 在预训练或蒸馏中引入**显式几何约束**（如对称性、支撑关系）。\n    - 输出**中间可视化结果**（如预测的抓取点、碰撞区域），便于人类监督和调试。\n\n### 6. **扩展蒸馏框架的适用性**\n- **方向**：将论文提出的**多步蒸馏策略**与更多类型的预训练表征（如来自大规模视频的4D表征、物理仿真模型）结合，学习更丰富的操作技能。\n- **方法**：将GEM3D Policy作为一个**通用适配器**，研究其与不同上游表征模型的兼容性和提升效果。\n\n---\n**总结**：GEM3D 在**视角泛化的机器人操作**上迈出了重要一步，但其局限性指出了未来研究在**数据效率、计算效率、泛化鲁棒性和系统可解释性**等关键维度上的改进空间。这些方向将推动视觉运动策略向更实用、更通用的现实世界部署迈进。",
