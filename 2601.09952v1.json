Red and green regions indicate false and true traversable areas, respectively.\nTo address these challenges, we propose OT-Drive, an Optimal Transport\n[\n15\n]\n-driven multi-modal fusion framework for improving the generalization of traversable area segmentation in unstructured environments.\nOur core insight is to formulate RGB and surface normal fusion as a scene-conditioned distribution transport problem.\nSpecifically, we first present a Scene Anchor Generator (SAG) that decomposes complex scene variations into disentangled environmental attributes—namely weather, time-of-day, and road type.\nBased on this explicit disentanglement, SAG constructs scene anchors that can generalize to novel, unseen combinations of environmental conditions.\nFurthermore, we propose an Optimal Transport-based Fusion (OT Fusion) module that, rather than forcing heterogeneous modalities into a shared feature space, seeks an optimal transport plan to align image features and surface normal features onto the manifold defined by the scene anchors.\nThis mechanism achieves distribution-level optimal fusion that enables robust cross-modal alignment. Consequently, OT-Drive ensures reliable traversable area segmentation in OOD scenarios.\nThe\nmain contributions\nof this work are summarized as follows:\n•\nWe propose OT-Drive, a novel multi-modal fusion framework that models RGB and surface normal fusion via optimal transport, achieving robust OOD generalization for traversable area segmentation. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first work to apply optimal transport to enhance the robustness of heterogeneous modality fusion under distribution shift.\n•\nWe design a novel Scene Anchor Generator (SAG) that disentangles scene variations into independent environmental attributes, constructing scene anchors that generalize to unseen environmental combinations.\n•\nWe develop an innovative Optimal Transport-based Fusion (OT Fusion) module that aligns heterogeneous modality features onto the manifold defined by scene anchors via optimal transport.\nBy minimizing the global transportation cost, this module achieves distribution-level optimal fusion that is highly robust to OOD scenarios.\n•\nExtensive experiments on multiple off-road datasets and the challenging cross-dataset transfer benchmarks validate the proposed framework, demonstrating state-of-the-art OOD generalization and confirming its practicality for real-world deployment.\nII\nRelated Work\nII-A\nSingle-Modal Traversable Area Segmentation\nEarly off-road traversable area segmentation primarily relied on geometric modeling from point clouds. Pioneering works employed explicit geometric constraints, such as Markov Random Fields (MRF) for ground height estimation\n[\n14\n]\nand concentric zone-based strategies for robust ground fitting, as seen in the Patchwork series\n[\n20\n,\n18\n]\n.\nTransitioning to data-driven approaches, end-to-end neural networks have been widely adopted to directly predict traversability from point clouds\n[\n31\n,\n30\n]\n.\nMore recently, hybrid architectures that project 3D point clouds onto 2D planes have enabled real-time modeling\n[\n38\n]\n, while self-supervised contrastive learning has been explored to resolve label ambiguity\n[\n40\n]\n.\nWhile point cloud-based methods provide strong geometric priors, they often lack the semantic understanding to differentiate structurally similar terrains.\nConversely, vision-based methods utilize grouped attention mechanisms to analyze terrain difficulty and texture\n[\n10\n,\n34\n]\n.\nTo overcome the limited field of view (FOV) of monocular cameras, recent approaches have extended perception capabilities via multi-view inputs and cross-view coordinate mappings\n[\n22\n,\n3\n]\n.\nIn summary, single-modal approaches inherently face trade-offs between geometric accuracy and semantic richness, limiting their reliability across diverse environmental conditions.\nII-B\nMulti-Modal Fusion for Traversable Area Segmentation\nTo capitalize on the complementary strengths of geometry and semantics, multi-modal fusion methods integrate heterogeneous sensor data, such as camera-LiDAR\n[\n16\n]\nor hyperspectral-radar combinations\n[\n28\n]\n.\nGiven the sparsity and irregularity of 3D point clouds, a prevalent strategy involves projecting them into camera-view surface normal maps to extract dense geometric features\n[\n5\n,\n37\n]\n.\nBuilding on this representation, researchers have integrated surface normal with RGB image using advanced architectures—ranging from Vision Transformers\n[\n23\n]\nto Swin Transformers\n[\n41\n]\n—to enhance feature extraction and alignment.\nOther approaches focus on refining boundary details by employing edge decoding modules\n[\n42\n]\nor duplex transformers\n[\n19\n]\n.\nFurthermore, to mitigate the impact of sensor noise and calibration errors, recent works have developed adaptive weighting and noise-aware intermediate fusion mechanisms\n[\n21\n,\n8\n]\n.\nHowever, most existing methods rely on pixel-level or token-level alignment, which often fails to capture distribution shifts in OOD scenarios.\nII-C\nDomain Generalization for Semantic Segmentation\nDomain Generalization (DG) aims to mitigate performance degradation caused by distribution discrepancies between training and test domains.\nEarly research primarily addressed this challenge through data augmentation and domain-invariant representation learning, exploiting texture statistics from ImageNet pre-training to enhance generalization\n[\n17\n,\n11\n]\n.\nRecently, leveraging textual semantics from Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to guide visual feature alignment has become a standard practice for enhancing generalization.\nOne line of methods constructs diverse pseudo-target domains through text prompts or generative models to enhance robustness against environmental variations\n[\n4\n,\n26\n]\n.\nAnother line directly incorporates text embeddings into segmentation frameworks, such as serving as decoder queries\n[\n27\n]\nor semantic prototypes\n[\n44\n]\n, significantly improving generalization under extreme styles or OOD scenarios.\nFurthermore, recent studies explore generating OOD prompts with varying semantic distances via WordNet\n[\n33\n]\n, optimizing cross-modal alignment\n[\n43\n]\n, and employing domain-aware prompt learning\n[\n12\n]\nto alleviate semantic misalignment.\nDespite significant progress in single-modal DG, existing works rarely address the distribution shifts inherent in heterogeneous multi-sensor fusion frameworks. This remains an open challenge in complex perception systems such as autonomous driving.\nIII\nMethod\nFigure 2\n:\nOverall architecture of the proposed OT-Drive.\nThe framework is composed of two modules designed for OOD generalization in traversable area segmentation:\n1) The Scene Anchor Generator (SAG) constructs scene-specific semantic anchors from the input image.\n2) The OT Fusion Module leverages optimal transport to align RGB and surface normal features onto the manifold spanned by the semantic anchors, achieving distribution-level feature fusion.\nIII-A\nProblem Formulation\nLet\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\ndenote the space of all real-world scene attribute combinations, such as weather (atmospheric conditions), time-of-day (temporal conditions), and road type (terrain properties).

The probability for each attribute\na\n∈\n{\nW\n,\nL\n,\nR\n}\na\\in\\{W,L,R\\}\nis computed as:\np\n​\n(\na\ni\n|\nI\n)\n=\nexp\n⁡\n(\n⟨\nCLS\nimg\n,\nT\na\ni\n⟩\n/\nτ\n)\n∑\nj\nexp\n⁡\n(\n⟨\nCLS\nimg\n,\nT\na\nj\n⟩\n/\nτ\n)\n,\np(a_{i}|I)=\\frac{\\exp(\\langle\\text{CLS}_{\\text{img}},T_{a_{i}}\\rangle/\\tau)}{\\sum_{j}\\exp(\\langle\\text{CLS}_{\\text{img}},T_{a_{j}}\\rangle/\\tau)},\n(5)\nwhere\nT\na\ni\nT_{a_{i}}\ndenotes the text embedding for the\ni\ni\n-th category of attribute\na\na\n, and\nτ\n\\tau\nis a learnable temperature parameter.\nIII-B\n2\nScene Anchor Generation\nAs illustrated in the lower part of Fig.\n3\n, we construct a static Scene Prototype\nS\n​\nP\nSP\nby enumerating the combinatorial space of disjoint attributes (\nW\n×\nD\n×\nR\nW\\times D\\times R\n). Additionally, we introduce two learnable Meta-Traversability embeddings\nM\n​\ne\n​\nt\n​\na\n∈\nℝ\n2\nMeta\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}\nto encode the latent semantics of traversable and non-traversable regions:\nS\n​\nP\n=\nE\nT\n​\n(\n𝒮\n,\nM\n​\ne\n​\nt\n​\na\n)\n,\nSP=E_{T}(\\mathcal{S},Meta),\n(6)\nwhere\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\ndenotes the set of all possible scene combinations.\nThe Scene Anchor\nT\n¯\nS\n\\bar{T}_{S}\nfor the current environment is then synthesized by aggregating the prototypes, weighted by their posterior probabilities inferred from the input image:\nT\n¯\nS\n=\n∑\ns\n∈\n𝒮\nP\n​\n(\ns\n|\nI\n)\n⋅\nE\nT\n​\n(\ns\n,\nM\n​\ne\n​\nt\n​\na\n)\n,\n\\bar{T}_{S}=\\sum_{s\\in\\mathcal{S}}P(s|I)\\cdot E_{T}(s,Meta),\n(7)\nwhere\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\ndenotes the set of all possible scene combinations, and\nE\nT\n​\n(\n⋅\n)\nE_{T}(\\cdot)\nis the frozen text encoder.\nIII-B\n3\nInference Efficiency\nA key advantage of this design is its efficiency: the text encoder is only used during training, and at deployment we simply weight the cached prototypes\nS\n​\nP\nSP\nwith inferred posterior probabilities to derive scene anchors.\nThis achieves zero-overhead semantic guidance by eliminating the text encoder at inference,\nimproving speed by 25.6% (from 2.97 to 3.73 FPS).\nIII-C\nMulti-modal Fusion via Optimal Transport\nAccording to the manifold hypothesis\n[\n36\n]\n, features from different modalities lie on distinct low-dimensional manifolds.\nConventional pixel-level or token-level alignment assumes rigid point-wise correspondence between these manifolds, which breaks down under OOD scenarios.\nOur key insight is that by transporting visual features from different modalities (RGB and surface normal) onto the scene anchor manifold, we can perform feature fusion on a domain-invariant representation space.\nFigure 4\n:\nOT Fusion Module.\nThe image and normal features are then transported to the scene anchor manifold via optimal transport for fusion.\nIII-C\n1\nSource Distribution and Target Distribution\nAs illustrated in Fig.\n4\n, we treat the extracted feature maps\nF\nℐ\n,\nF\n𝒩\n∈\nℝ\nH\n′\n×\nW\n′\n×\nC\nF_{\\mathcal{I}},F_{\\mathcal{N}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{H^{\\prime}\\times W^{\\prime}\\times C}\nas uniform source distributions over the pixel grid:\nμ\nℐ\n=\n1\nN\n​\n∑\ni\n=\n1\nN\nδ\nf\ni\nℐ\n,\nμ\n𝒩\n=\n1\nN\n​\n∑\ni\n=\n1\nN\nδ\nf\ni\n𝒩\n,\n\\mu_{\\mathcal{I}}=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\delta_{f_{i}^{\\mathcal{I}}},\\quad\\mu_{\\mathcal{N}}=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\delta_{f_{i}^{\\mathcal{N}}},\n(8)\nwhere\nN\n=\nH\n′\n×\nW\n′\nN=H^{\\prime}\\times W^{\\prime}\ndenotes the number of spatial locations and\nδ\n\\delta\nis the Dirac delta function.\nThe target distribution\nν\n\\nu\nis derived by fusing the pre-segmentation probability maps from both modalities via element-wise max pooling:\nν\n=\n∑\nk\n=\n1\nK\nm\nk\n​\nδ\nT\nk\n,\nm\nk\n=\nmax\n⁡\n(\nP\nℐ\n(\nk\n)\n,\nP\n𝒩\n(\nk\n)\n)\n∑\nj\n=\n1\nK\nmax\n⁡\n(\nP\nℐ\n(\nj\n)\n,\nP\n𝒩\n(\nj\n)\n)\n,\n\\nu=\\sum_{k=1}^{K}m_{k}\\delta_{T_{k}},\\quad m_{k}=\\frac{\\max(P_{\\mathcal{I}}^{(k)},P_{\\mathcal{N}}^{(k)})}{\\sum_{j=1}^{K}\\max(P_{\\mathcal{I}}^{(j)},P_{\\mathcal{N}}^{(j)})},\n(9)\nwhere\nT\nk\nT_{k}\ndenotes the\nk\nk\n-th semantic anchor and\nP\nℐ\n(\nk\n)\n,\nP\n𝒩\n(\nk\n)\nP_{\\mathcal{I}}^{(k)},P_{\\mathcal{N}}^{(k)}\nare the pre-segmentation probabilities for class\nk\nk\nfrom the image and surface normal branches, respectively.

This validates that scene anchors effectively enhance the model’s generalization capability.\n2.\nEffectiveness of OT Fusion.\nComparing Model #2 with Model #3 reveals consistent performance gains in OOD scenarios, validating that distribution-level feature fusion via optimal transport can achieve robust generalization when encountering OOD features in unseen environments.\n3.\nEffectiveness of Marginal Probability Modeling.\nComparing Model #3 with the full model demonstrates that marginal probability modeling is essential for generalizing to unseen scene combinations, as it enables factor recombination and significantly narrows the generalization gap on both datasets.\nIV-F\nQualitative Analysis\nFigure 8\n:\nQualitative comparison of segmentation results. From left to right: RGB input, OFF-Net\n[\n23\n]\n, M2F2-Net\n[\n42\n]\n, ROD\n[\n35\n]\n, and OT-Drive (Ours).\nWe present qualitative comparisons between our method and baseline models in Fig.\n8\n, specifically targeting unknown scene combinations.\nExisting methods show inconsistent performance: multi-modal methods excel at night but struggle on snow, while RGB-only models exhibit the opposite behavior.\nHowever, our method exhibits consistent superiority across both conditions, validating the effectiveness of our distribution-level OT Fusion.\nIn gravel and dirt road scenarios, existing methods frequently misclassify geometrically flat regions.\nThis occurs because their traversability semantics are biased by flat areas in the training set.\nOur SAG addresses this by compositionally combining marginal probability distributions to construct domain-invariant scene anchors that generalize to unseen scenarios.\nIV-G\nEfficiency Analysis\nTo assess practical deployment potential, we benchmark all methods on the NVIDIA Tesla T4—a widely adopted edge computing GPU.\nFor multi-modal methods, we include GPU-accelerated surface normal estimation in the total pipeline time.\nAs shown in Table\nVI\n, by simply applying standard inference optimizations (PyTorch 2.0 graph compilation and FP16 mixed-precision), OT-Drive achieves 21.11 FPS—a 5.66\n×\n\\times\nspeedup over the base configuration.\nThese results demonstrate the strong real-time deployment potential of OT-Drive on resource-constrained edge devices.\nTABLE VI\n:\nComparison of inference speed (FPS) on Tesla T4.\n†\n\\dagger\nincludes surface normal estimation latency.\nMethod\nOFF-Net\n†\nM2F2-Net\n†\nROD\nOT-Drive\n†\n(Ours)\nBase\nOptimized\nFPS\n4.49\n4.23\n3.58\n3.73\n21.11\nV\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we presented OT-Drive, a novel multi-modal fusion framework designed to address the challenge of OOD generalization in off-road traversable area segmentation.\nThe Scene Anchor Generator models marginal probabilities of scene attributes and constructs generalizable scene anchors by composing environmental attributes.\nThe OT Fusion module then aligns RGB and surface normal features onto the semantic manifold defined by these anchors, achieving distribution-level fusion via Optimal Transport.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that OT-Drive significantly outperforms existing baselines, particularly in OOD scenarios, and achieves a substantial 13.99% mIoU gain in cross-dataset transfer tasks.\nMoreover, OT-Drive attains a real-time inference speed of 21.11 FPS, ensuring its suitability for practical deployment.\nWe believe this work represents a meaningful exploration of leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for traversable area segmentation.\nDespite these advancements, our method relies on a predefined closed-set scene space to ensure real-time efficiency.\nIn the future, we aim to extend this framework by exploring the integration of the complex reasoning capabilities and open-world knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), enabling more fine-grained and context-aware traversable area segmentation in complex environments.\nReferences\n[1]\nB.

    "preview_text": "Reliable traversable area segmentation in unstructured environments is critical for planning and decision-making in autonomous driving. However, existing data-driven approaches often suffer from degraded segmentation performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, consequently impairing downstream driving tasks. To address this issue, we propose OT-Drive, an Optimal Transport--driven multi-modal fusion framework. The proposed method formulates RGB and surface normal fusion as a distribution transport problem. Specifically, we design a novel Scene Anchor Generator (SAG) to decompose scene information into the joint distribution of weather, time-of-day, and road type, thereby constructing semantic anchors that can generalize to unseen scenarios. Subsequently, we design an innovative Optimal Transport-based multi-modal fusion module (OT Fusion) to transport RGB and surface normal features onto the manifold defined by the semantic anchors, enabling robust traversable area segmentation under OOD scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 95.16% mIoU on ORFD OOD scenarios, outperforming prior methods by 6.35%, and 89.79% mIoU on cross-dataset transfer tasks, surpassing baselines by 13.99%.These results indicate that the proposed model can attain strong OOD generalization with only limited training data, substantially enhancing its practicality and efficiency for real-world deployment.\n\nOT-Drive: Out-of-Distribution Off-Road Traversable Area Segmentation via Optimal Transport\nZhihua Zhao, Guoqiang Li\n∗\n, Chen Min, and Kangping Lu\nThis work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.
