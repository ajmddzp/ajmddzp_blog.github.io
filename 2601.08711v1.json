By integrating sophisticated control algorithms, prosthetic hands can more accurately mimic the natural movements of a human hand, allowing users to perform a wider range of tasks with greater precision.\nThese advanced control strategies often utilize sEMG or force sensors to detect muscle activity or interaction forces, which are interpreted by reinforcement learning-based controllers to adaptively generate grasping motions or trajectory adjustments in real time\n[\n3\n]\n.\nEffective control strategies are particularly important to individuals who rely on prosthetic limbs for daily activities, as effective control strategies can significantly improve their quality of life\n[\n4\n,\n5\n]\n.\nThe development of adaptive and intuitive control systems enables users to engage in complex tasks, such as grasping objects of varying shapes and sizes, thereby enhancing the overall functionality of the prosthetic device\n[\n6\n]\n,\n[\n7\n]\n. The synergy between kinematic and dynamic models in controller design not only improves the precision of soft robots but also expands their functional capabilities\n[\n8\n]\n.\nThe integration of these modeling strategies enables the development of controllers that can effectively manage the inherent uncertainties associated with soft materials.\nHybrid controller strategies incorporating Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based algorithms are developed nowadays to improve the performance of the soft robotic motions with less computational efforts\n[\n9\n]\n.\nThis study presents a control scheme that integrates an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with a Sliding Mode Controller (SMC) to manipulate motions of a soft continuum wrist attached to a prosthetic hand. We combined the adaptive learning capability of ANN for modeling complex, nonlinear system dynamics with the robustness of sliding mode control (SMC) to handle external disturbances and model uncertainties. We adopted Piece-wise Constant Curvature (PCC) modelling strategy to determine kinematic and dynamic models of the soft continuum wrist. PCC offered a solution to the complexities associated with the infinite dimensionality due to the complex configurations of soft robots. The model obtained using PCC was used in the controller strategy to increase accuracy and performance of the controller outputs.\nThe major contributions of the presented work are as follows:\n•\nModelling of a soft continuum wrist based on a 4-element parameterized configuration using PCC method.\n•\nDevelopment of a data and model-based approach combining ANN and SMC for improving the performance of wrist motions.\n•\nA comparison study of the proposed controller with a PID controller and other model-based controllers to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed controller.\n•\nAn experimental validation proving the effectiveness of the proposed controller in presence of external disturbances during real-time implementations with reduced computational effort.\nThe outline of this paper is given as follows: Section II presents related work on the development of controllers for soft continuum mechanisms. Design and modelling procedures are given in section III. SMC strategy is demonstrated in section IV. Section V presents the simulation and experimental results. Section VI presents the conclusion of this work, summarizing key findings and outlining potential directions for future research.\n2\nBACKGROUND\nThe integration of tendons allows soft robots to achieve complex motions while maintaining structural integrity.\nTendon-driven soft continuum robots offer several notable advantages that enhance functionality and versatility of the whole mechanism\n[\n10\n]\n,\n[\n11\n]\n. Various modeling techniques such as Constant Curvature (CC) models\n[\n12\n]\n, Variable Curvature (VC) models\n[\n13\n]\n, Finite Element Method (FEM)\n[\n14\n]\n, Machine Learning (ML) methods\n[\n15\n]\nare employed to determine both static and dynamic models of soft robots.\nThe major benefit of PCC modeling is its ability to accommodate the inherent flexibility and adaptability of soft robots\n[\n16\n]\n. Unlike traditional rigid-body models, which often struggle to accurately depict the dexterous motions of soft robots, the PCC model captures the continuous nature of soft robots while maintaining computational efficiency.\nPCC-based modeling has been widely adopted for soft continuum robots due to its ability to approximate complex, continuous deformations using discrete constant-curvature segments. This approach enables simplified kinematic formulations while maintaining sufficient accuracy for many practical applications. By reducing the complexity of continuous deformation into manageable geometric primitives, PCC facilitates real-time control and simulation, which is particularly valuable for robots operating in constrained or dynamic environments. Moreover, it allows for modular representation of multi-segment structures, making it easier to integrate with optimization and learning-based control frameworks. PCC models are also compatible with various actuation strategies including tendon-driven, pneumatic, and hybrid systems further enhancing their versatility across different soft robotic platforms. Despite its approximative nature, PCC has proven effective in capturing essential motion characteristics, especially when combined with empirical calibration or adaptive control techniques.\nPCC-based modelling of a rigid-soft continuum robot actuated using bellows was carried out in\n[\n17\n]\n. Experimental validation showcased a higher positional accuracy (higher than 98%) during the motions of the robot. A PCC method employed for deriving kinematic model of a soft robot manufactured using latex rubber was demonstrated in\n[\n18\n]\n. Experimental validations demonstrated that the model could not sustain load when the loading surpassed the stiffness of the trunk. PCC based 3D modelling of a tendon-driven soft continuum robot considering twisting effects was presented in\n[\n19\n]\n. The static modelling methodology was employed for modelling a tendon-driven continuum robot that encounters stability issues due to dimensional constraints on the rods along their backbone.\nA continuum robot modelled using an approximate piecewise constant curvature (APCC) method was illustrated in\n[\n20\n]\n. The APCC model simplified the original kinematic model by employing classical rigid linkages, thereby enhancing numerical stability.\nAnother soft continuum robot modelled using PCC method incorporating a 4 parameter configuration criteria was discussed in\n[\n31\n]\n. A dynamic model based controller was implemented employing the PCC method.\nIncorporating kinematic and dynamic models into a controller scheme facilitates a structured and efficient way to handle curvature-related computations\n[\n21\n]\n. SMC strategies are presently employed in a wide variety of applications to control the movements of various soft robots owing to its superior performance capabilities\n[\n22\n]\n.\nAn adaptive SMC developed for a soft robotic actuator was presented in\n[\n23\n]\n. The proposed control strategy showcased tracking precision utilizing a non-singular sliding surface and a higher-order sliding mode observer. An adaptive SMC strategy, that demonstrated resilience to uncertainties in model parameters and unanticipated input disturbances was illustrated in\n[\n24\n]\n. Experiments conducted using a soft continuum arm to assess the controller’s effectiveness in tracking task-space trajectories across various payloads exhibited a tracking accuracy more than 98% compared to a traditional controller.\nThe performance of a feed forward SMC scheme for controlling a soft pneumatic actuator was evaluated in\n[\n25\n]\n. The controller scheme aided the robot in following dynamic trajectories across various frequencies in the presence of an external force with reduced error values and chattering.\nIn\n[\n26\n]\n, a soft robot was controlled using an SMC with a PID sliding surface. The suggested controller employed feedback error to establish a PID sliding surface, while a nonlinear SMC ensured that the system aligned with this surface.\nThe experimental findings indicated that the suggested controller effectively reduced vibration amplitude to a significantly lower range. SMC scheme of a tendon- driven soft robot employing cosserat rod theory was presented in\n[\n27\n]\n. A generalized\nα\n\\alpha\nmethod was adopted for reducing computational load during analyses.\nThe integration of artificial neural networks ANN with SMC enhances system adaptability to nonlinear dynamics while maintaining robustness against external disturbances and model uncertainties. Firstly, the integration of ANN allows for the approximation of complex nonlinear functions, which can effectively model system dynamics that are difficult to characterize using traditional methods\n[\n28\n]\n. This capability enables the controller to adapt to changing system conditions and uncertainties, thereby improving robustness and stability.\nFurthermore, the combination of these two methodologies can lead to improved convergence rates and reduced chattering effects, which are common challenges in conventional SMCs.\nA comprehensive review of recent literature on soft continuum robot control conducted as part of this work identified several recurring limitations in existing controller strategies, including sub-optimal control performance, high computational demands, inaccurate modeling assumptions, and challenges in tuning parameters. This paper outlines the techniques and approaches utilized to develop a model and data-based scheme for a controller, that is capable of controlling the motions of a soft wrist in presence of external disturbances with improved precision and reduced computational effort.\n3\nDESIGN AND MODELLING OF THE SOFT CONTINUUM WRIST\nThis section presents the components and mechanical design of the wrist integrated into the prosthetic hand. Kinematic and dynamic modellings of the wrist using PCC method are also included in this section.\n3.1\nDesign of the Wrist\nWe developed a soft continuum wrist section\n[\n29\n]\nand integrated it with the prosthetic hand known as PRISMA HAND II\n[\n30\n]\n. The wrist was designed to meet specific load-bearing requirements and to support motion in four anatomical directions: ulnar deviation, radial deviation, flexion, and extension. The wrist integrated to the PRISMA HAND II along with the directions of motions are shown in Fig.\n1\n(a).\nFigure 1:\nWrist section (a) Conceptual model (b) Fabricated model\nThe wrist section was composed of 5 rigid discs, 5 springs, and 5 tendons inserted through the springs. The tendons are manipulated to obtain desired motions in different directions\n[\n29\n]\n. Due to the arrangement of the components, the wrist section can also compress and expand in axial direction.\nWith regard to disc 5, the wrist’s range of motion was set to -50\n∘\nto +50\n∘\nin all directions. This was adequate for the PRISMA HAND II to perform manipulation tasks.\n3.2\nKinematic modelling of the wrist using PCC method\nIn the context of soft robotics, the PCC model provides a systematic framework for understanding the robot’s configuration by breaking it down into discrete segments that exhibit CC. The segmentation is crucial, as it simplifies the complex nature of soft robots, which often possess an infinite number of degrees of freedom due to their flexible and deformable structures. By employing a finite number of segments, the model not only enhances computational efficiency but also allows for a more intuitive analysis of the robot’s kinematics and dynamics. Consider a soft continuum robot with\nn\nn\nCCs shown in Fig.\n2\n(a) and corresponding frames attached to the end of each segment are represented as\nS\n0\n,\nS\n1\n,\n…\n.\n.\n,\nS\nn\nS_{0},S_{1},.....,S_{n}\n. Transformation matrices from\nn\nt\n​\nh\nn^{th}\nframe to zeroth frame are represented as\nT\n1\n0\n,\n1\nT\n2\n,\n…\n…\n,\nn\n−\n1\nT\nn\n{}^{0}T_{1},^{1}T_{2},......,^{n-1}T_{n}\n.\nFigure 2:\nConfiguration (a) Transformations (b) Single segment (c) RPPR\nA single section of the soft continuum robot is shown in Fig.\n2\n(b). The robot currently in\ni\nt\n​\nh\ni^{th}\nplane consisted of two inertial frames at the ends, namely\nS\ni\n−\n1\nS_{i-1}\nand\nS\ni\nS_{i}\n. Bending angles,\nθ\nb\n\\theta_{b}\nwere obtained by considering a relative rotation between the two inertial frames of the segment. The 2D homogeneous transformation matrix of the soft robot,\nT\ni\ni\n−\n1\n{}^{i-1}T_{i}\nwith section length,\nl\ni\nl_{i}\nfrom\ni\n−\n1\nt\n​\nh\ni-1^{th}\nframe to\ni\nt\n​\nh\ni^{th}\nframe in\ni\nt\n​\nh\ni^{th}\nplane is given in equation\n1\n.\nT\ni\ni\n−\n1\n=\n[\nc\n​\no\n​\ns\n​\nθ\nb\n−\ns\n​\ni\n​\nn\n​\nθ\nb\nl\ni\n​\ns\n​\ni\n​\nn\n​\nθ\nb\nθ\nb\ns\n​\ni\n​\nn\n​\nθ\nb\nc\n​\no\n​\ns\n​\nθ\nb\nl\ni\n​\n1\n−\nc\n​\no\n​\ns\n​\nθ\nb\nθ\nb\n0\n0\n1\n]\n{}^{i-1}T_{i}=\\begin{bmatrix}cos\\theta_{b}&-sin\\theta_{b}&l_{i}\\frac{sin\\theta_{b}}{\\theta_{b}}\\\\\nsin\\theta_{b}&cos\\theta_{b}&l_{i}\\frac{1-cos\\theta_{b}}{\\theta_{b}}\\\\\n0&0&1\\end{bmatrix}\n(1)\nIn this work, we present a framework that establishes an equivalence between the modelling of a soft robot and a rigid robot using DH parametrization\n[\n31\n]\n.\nWe can generate conceptual linkages correspond to a PCC soft continuum robot using rigid robot topologies. The state-space representation of an equivalent rigid robot can be used for creating an augmented representation of a PCC soft continuum robot. Consider\nμ\n∈\nR\nn\n​\nm\n\\mu\\in R^{n~m}\nas the augmented configuration of a PCC soft robot with\nm\nm\nnumber of joints per CC. The two configurations of the robot are mapped as follows:\nμ\n:\nR\nn\n→\nR\nn\n​\nm\n\\mu:R^{n}\\rightarrow R^{n~m}\n(2)\nThe mapping ensures that the terminal points of each CC segment align precisely with the corresponding reference points of the rigid robotic structure. From a kinematic perspective, any augmented representation that fulfills the aligning condition can be deemed equivalent. This equivalence is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the robotic motion and ensuring that the kinematic relationships are preserved across different configurations.\nConsider an equivalent rigid robot shown in Fig.\n2\n(c) with RPPR (R:Revolute, P:Prismatic) configuration. A point mass,\nW\nb\nW_{b}\npositioned at the center of the main chord serves as an appropriate approximation for the mass distribution of the CC segment.

Proper tuning of\nP\n1\nP_{1}\nand\nP\n2\nP_{2}\nensures that the controller can effectively manage system dynamics, particularly in the presence of uncertainties and external disturbances.\nSliding surface\nS\nS\nwas selected based on the convergence in finite time to guarantee optimal control and is given in equation\n21\nS\n=\nθ\n˙\no\n∈\nR\nn\n:\nσ\n​\n(\nθ\n)\n=\n0\nS={\\dot{\\theta}_{o}\\in R^{n}:\\sigma(\\theta)=0}\n(21)\nU\ns\n​\nw\n​\ni\n​\nt\n​\nc\n​\nh\n​\ni\n​\nn\n​\ng\nU_{switching}\nis given in equation\n22\nU\ns\n​\nw\n​\ni\n​\nt\n​\nc\n​\nh\n​\ni\n​\nn\n​\ng\n=\n1\nL\ng\n​\n(\nσ\n​\n(\nθ\n)\n)\n​\nP\n3\n​\nt\n​\na\n​\nn\n​\nh\n​\n(\nσ\n​\n(\nθ\n)\n)\nU_{switching}=\\frac{1}{L_{g}(\\sigma(\\theta))}P_{3}~tanh(\\sigma(\\theta))\n(22)\nwhere\nP\n3\nP_{3}\nis a control parameter to increase the stability of the controller.\nT\n​\na\n​\nn\n​\nh\nTanh\nfunction was used instead of\ns\n​\ng\n​\nn\nsgn\nfunction and the generated trajectory was smoother compared to\ns\n​\ng\n​\nn\nsgn\nfunction.

The ANN network used for predicting bending angles based on the desired x and y positions of the last disc (disc 5) of the soft continuum wrist (Fig.\n4\n).\nFigure 4:\nANN architecture\nFrom a total of 1,000 samples, 750 were utilized for training and 250 were reserved for testing and validating the outcomes. 3 hidden layers consisted of 200, 100, and 100 neurons respectively. Performance objective was set to zero and initial learning rate was assumed as 0.01. Along sigmoid function, we also trained the ANN using ReLU, Leaky ReLU, and Tanh functions.Hidden layer optimization was performed via grid search, testing architectures with 1 to 5 fully connected layers. Each configuration was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation. The 3-layer architecture achieved the best trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency, with diminishing returns observed beyond three layers. ADAM (Adaptive Moment Estimation) method\n[\n32\n]\n, an extension of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method with momentum was used as the backpropagation technique. Sigmoid function was chosen for neuron activation in the network following a comparative analysis with 3 other alternative activation functions. This decision was based on the performance metrics observed during the evaluation, which indicated that the sigmoid function provided superior results in terms of accuracy and stability.\n5\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nWe have conducted both simulation and experimental validation of the proposed control algorithm on the wrist section of the system. The controller’s performance was assessed under two conditions: with and without the application of external forces. A comparative analysis between the proposed SMC scheme and other model-based controllers developed for the same wrist section is presented in the sections 5.1 - 5.3. Additionally, experimental trials were performed to evaluate the real-time effectiveness of the SMC in executing dynamic tasks.\n5.1\nSimulation study\nController loops were created inside Simulink, a MATLAB based software and carried out using a PC with an Intelcore i7 processor and 16 GB RAM. The motions of wrist section in various directions are shown in Figs.\n5\n(a) - (h).\nFigure 5:\nMotion of wrist (a) Radial-1 (b) Radial-2 (c) Ulnar-1 (d) Ulnar-2 (e) Flexion-1 (f) Flexion-2 (g) Extension-1 (h) Extension-2\nThe wrist section was assumed to be bending from its initial configuration shown in Figs.\n5\nto a final bending angle of\n30\n0\n30^{0}\nin these directions with respect to the last significant point on disc 5 attached to the hand. The motions of the wrist section were initially controlled using the proposed SMC given in section IV.\nIn simulation study, the responses of the system during motion in ulnar deviation direction were only illustrated as all movements were symmetrical, allowing for the prediction of responses in other directions based on the obtained results.\nDamping and stiffness values of the wrist were determined as\n0.615\n0.615\nNm and\n0.105\n0.105\nNms respectively.\nIn the context of soft robots, which may experience significant changes in their mechanical properties due to deformation or environmental interactions, SMC strategy ensures that the robot can still achieve its desired trajectory and performance metrics.\nBy effectively managing the non-linearities and uncertainties associated with motions of soft wrist section, SMC facilitated smoother and more efficient motions, thereby improving the overall functionality of the system\n[\n33\n]\n. Tuning parameters (\nP\n1\nP_{1}\n,\nP\n2\nP_{2}\n, and\nP\n3\nP_{3}\n) were essential for achieving the desired trade-off between system responsiveness and stability. These parameters dictated the sliding surface’s characteristics, which in turn aided the system to reject disturbances and track reference signals. If the parameters are not optimally set, the controller can exhibit undesirable behaviors such as chattering, which can lead to wear and tear on mechanical components or even system instability.\nInitially\nP\n1\nP_{1}\n,\nP\n2\nP_{2}\n, and\nP\n3\nP_{3}\nwere set to 1. These parameters were tuned using Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) to obtain optimal values for reducing output error and chattering. Final values of\nP\n1\nP_{1}\n,\nP\n2\nP_{2}\n, and\nP\n3\nP_{3}\nwere determined as 0.001,1000, and 1000 respectively.\nAn ANN block was included in the control scheme for determining desired bending angles. ANN dataset was generated using kinematic model obtained using PCC method. The ANN was trained using a batch size of 100 samples over the course of 100 epochs. The dataset was partitioned such that 75% was allocated for training purposes, while the remaining 25% percent was designated for validation of the network’s performance. The performances of the networks were compared in table\n2\n. Based on the accuracy of the results, which are evident from table\n2\n, we selected sigmoid function as the activation function.\nTable 2:\nANN based training parameters and results\nParameters\nSigmoid\nReLU\nLeaky ReLU\nTanh\nBatch size\n100\n100\n100\n100\nEpochs\n100\n100\n100\n100\nGradient\n0.0012\n0.097\n0.041\n0.011\nMomentum\n0.90\n0.95\n0.92\n0.97\nWeight decay\n0.01\n0.01\n0.01\n0.01\nAccuracy\n99.7\n95.5\n97.1\n98.8\nLearning rate\n0.003\n0.001\n0.001\n0.002\nTraining loss\n0.05\n0.55\n0.31\n0.22\nValidation loss\n0.01\n0.25\n0.10\n0.09\nThe errors in the values of desired bending angles with respect to output bending angles obtained using the SMC strategy during simulation study are shown in fig.\n6\n. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of error values was obtained as\n2.7\n×\n10\n−\n4\n2.7\\times 10^{-4}\nradians.

Fig.\n8\ndepicts the errors in the required bending angle values compared to the output bending angles obtained during simulation study using PID based controller.

These values were higher compared to results obtained using SMC. Hence, SMC demonstrated superior efficiency and performance compared to PID controller.\nFigure 8:\nError in angles using PID controller during ulnar deviation\n5.2\nComparison with other controllers\nThe performance of the neuro-controller was also compared with other model based controllers developed for the wrist section. Results obtained using a Model Reference Adaptive Controller (MRAC)\n[\n34\n]\n, a Geometric Variable Strain Controller (GVSC)\n[\n29\n]\nand a Neuro Controller (NC)\n[\n35\n]\ndeveloped for the wrist section were compared with the results obtained using the proposed controller. RMSE, settling time and steady state error were compared to analyse the performances of the controllers as given in table\n3\n.\nTable 3:\nComparison study\nParameters\nMRAC\nGVSC\nNC\nRMSE\n1.2\n×\n10\n−\n3\n1.2\\times 10^{-3}\n2.9\n×\n10\n−\n2\n2.9\\times 10^{-2}\n5.0\n×\n10\n−\n2\n5.0\\times 10^{-2}\nSettling time (s)\n2.8\n2.8\n3.18\n3.18\n1.02\n1.02\nSteady state error\n1.3\n×\n10\n−\n3\n1.3\\times 10^{-3}\n1.4\n×\n10\n−\n2\n1.4\\times 10^{-2}\n1.9\n×\n10\n−\n2\n1.9\\times 10^{-2}\nProposed SMC controller performed better in terms of RMSE and Steady state error. However, settling time of the proposed SMC was higher compared to NC. NC converged faster within 1.02 seconds and performed better in terms of settling time compared to other controllers. However, RMSE and steady state error values were higher compared to other controllers. GVSC approach showcased higher steady state error, settling time and RMSE values compared to MRAC approach. In terms of RMSE and steady state error values, MRAC performed better than GVSC and NC.\n5.3\nExperimental validation of SMC\nThe validation of the proposed controller scheme and its motion capabilities were conducted using a fabricated wrist section integrated to the PRISMA hand II (shown in Fig.\n1\n(b)). Four peripheral tendons were utilized to enable rotational movements in four separate directions. Tendons 1 and 2 were engaged to facilitate radial deviation of the wrist, while tendons 4 and 5 managed movements in the ulnar direction. Furthermore, tendons 1 and 4 were employed for extension motions, whereas flexion was governed by tendons 2 and 5. The lowest disc (disc 1) was secured to a stable platform, and the highest disc (disc 5) was connected to the hand. Tendons 4 and 5 were pulled by actuating motors 3 and 4 in anticlockwise direction to rotate the wrist in ulnar direction. An ArUco marker placed on the wrist was used for tracking motions of the disc 5 during experimentation. Desired values of motion were given as the input to the ANN block. Desired bending angles obtained from ANN block were given as the inputs to SMC. The desired actuation forces generated from SMC block were converted to motor torque values and later converted to PWM signals. The PWM signals were fed to an Arduino Mega 2560. The Arduino was connected to 2 stepper motors using a microstep driver (DM542).\nAn Arduino module was integrated with Simulink to facilitate the transmission of the calculated input signals and a ROS module was employed to relay the readings from the ArUco markers into the Simulink environment. The flow of data during experimentation is shown in Fig.\n9\n.\nFigure 9:\nFlow of data during experimentation\nThe motions of wrist carrying the hand during experimentation are shown in Figs.\n10\n(a) - (l). Comparison of desired and obtained bending angles during experimentation is shown in Fig\n11\n(a) - (d).\nFigure 10:\nMotion of hand during experimentation (a)-(c)Extension (d)-(f)Flexion (g)-(i)Radial (j)-(l)Ulnar\nFigure 11:\nComparison of desired and obtained bending angles during experimentation(a)Extension (b)Flexion (c)Radial (d)Ulnar\nDuring experimentation, average values of RMSE of error values of bending angles, settling time, and steady state error were obtained as 0.157 radians, 3 s and 0.032 radians respectively. The errors during the hand motion are shown in Fig.\n12\n.\nFigure 12:\nError in hand motions during experimentation(a)Extension (b)Flexion (c)Radial (d)Ulnar\nThe data clearly indicates that the error values observed during experimentation were significantly greater than those recorded during the simulation study. The primary factor contributing to the\nincreased error margin observed during the experimental\nphase was the reduced stiffness of the springs utilized in the wrist segment. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the wrist successfully supported the payload while ensuring the stability of the hand throughout the motions.\nTo assess the controller’s adaptability in response to external unknown forces, an external force was applied using a human hand while the prosthetic hand executed radial deviation and flexion movements, as shown in Figs.\n13\n(a) - (g). The comparison of desired and obtained bending angles during the application of external disturbances are presented in Figs.\n12\n(e) - (f).The motion errors during the application of external disturbances are presented in Figs.\n14\n(e) - (f).\nFigure 13:\nErrors in the hand motion during experimentation in presence of external disturbances (a) - (c)Radial (e) - (g)Flexion\nThe motion showcased an average RMSE value of 0.207 m in radial direction and RMSE value of 0.291 m in flexion direction. Average value of settling time for radial and flexion directions was obtained as 3 seconds. Steady state error values were obtained as 0.029 s for radial direction and 0.031 s for flexion direction. The values of settling time, steady state error and RMSE were higher as compared to experimental results without the presence of force. However, these values are in tolerance range and the convergence of the results indicates the controller’s capability to manipulate the motions of wrist section even in the presence of external disturbances.\nFigure 14:\nComparison of desired and obtained bending angles (a)Extension (b)Flexion (c)Radial (d)Ulnar\n6\nCONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS\nDevelopment of a sophisticated control framework is essential for optimizing the performance of soft continuum robots.\nThis work presented a PCC model-based SMC, that can attain dynamic control of a soft continuum wrist integrated to a prosthetic hand. The integration of ANN with SMC contributed several significant advantages that enhanced system performance and robustness. By employing the SMC approach, the system maintained desired motion trajectories even in the presence of variations in the robot’s physical properties and environmental conditions.The alignment of the results during the application of external disturbances demonstrated the controller’s ability to regulate the movements of the wrist section, even when faced with external disturbances. ANN contributed the controller performance by reducing computational time. The performance of the SMC was compared with an ANN based PID controller and other model based controllers. The SMC exhibited a lower RMSE of errors compared to a PID controller using simulation studies. Furthermore, values of settling time and steady state errors exhibited by SMC were lower compared to PID controller. Hence, using the simulation study, it was concluded that SMC performed better compared to the PID controller. The proposed SMC controller also demonstrated superior performance with respect to RMSE and steady-state error compared to model based controllers. During experimentation, RMSE values of errors were observed higher compared to simulation values due to spring stiffness variation.\nFuture works will focus on re-fabricating the current design of wrist to create a more robust structure. Controller strategies will be updated by integrating real-time sensor feedback to increase the accuracy of motion.\nDeclarations:\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the Italian Ministry of Research under the complementary actions to the NRRP ”Fit4MedRob - Fit for Medical Robotics” Grant (PNC0000007).\nConflict of interest/Competing interests\nAll authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\nEthics approval and consent to participate\nNot applicable\nConsent for publication\nNot applicable\nData availability statement\nThe data associated with this work will be shared by contacting the authors.\nMaterials availability\nNot applicable\nCode availability\nThe code will be made available by contacting the corresponding author.\nAuthor contribution\nShifa Sulaiman derived the mathematical models, performed analytic calculations, carried out simulations, experimental validations, and wrote the paper.

    "preview_text": "The incorporation of advanced control algorithms into prosthetic hands significantly enhances their ability to replicate the intricate motions of a human hand. This work introduces a model-based controller that combines an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach with a Sliding Mode Controller (SMC) designed for a tendon-driven soft continuum wrist integrated into a prosthetic hand known as \"PRISMA HAND II\". Our research focuses on developing a controller that provides a fast dynamic response with reduced computational effort during wrist motions. The proposed controller consists of an ANN for computing bending angles together with an SMC to regulate tendon forces. Kinematic and dynamic models of the wrist are formulated using the Piece-wise Constant Curvature (PCC) hypothesis. The performance of the proposed controller is compared with other control strategies developed for the same wrist. Simulation studies and experimental validations of the fabricated wrist using the controller are included in the paper.\n\n[1]\n\\fnm\nShifa\n\\sur\nSulaiman\n1]\n\\orgdiv\nDepartment of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering,\n\\orgname\nUniversity of Naples Federico II,\n\\orgaddress\n\\street\nClaudio,\n\\city\nNaples,\n\\postcode\n80125,\n\\state\nCampania,\n\\country\nItaly\n2]\n\\orgdiv\nDepartment of Mechanical Engineering,\n\\orgname\nNational Institute of Technology,\n\\orgaddress\n\\street\nMahatma Gandhi Avenue,\n\\city\nDurgapur,\n\\postcode\n713209,\n\\state\nWest Bengal,\n\\country\nIndia\nA Hybrid Model-based and Data-based Approach Developed for a Prosthetic\nHand Wrist\nssajmech@gmail.com\n\\fnm\nFrancesco\n\\sur\nSchetter\nschfrn@gmail.com\n\\fnm\nMehul\n\\sur\nMenon\nmenonm98@gmail.com\n\\fnm\nand Fanny\n\\sur\nFicuciello\nfanny.ficuciello@unina.it\n[\n[\nAbstract\nThe incorporation of advanced control algorithms\ninto prosthetic hands significantly enhances their ability to\nreplicate the intricate motions of a human hand.
