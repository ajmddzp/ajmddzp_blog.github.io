Yet, despite their realism, these models often lack geometric grounding, limiting their use in navigation tasks that require spatial coherence and long-horizon stability. We introduce\nReinforcement Learning with World Grounding (RLWG)\n, a self-supervised post-training framework that aligns pretrained world models with a physically verifiable structure through geometric and perceptual rewards. Analogous to reinforcement learning from verifiable feedback (RLVR) in language models, RLWG can use multiple rewards that measure pose cycle-consistency, depth reprojection, and temporal coherence. We instantiate this framework with\nGrndCtrl\n, a reward-aligned adaptation method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), yielding world models that maintain stable trajectories, consistent geometry, and reliable rollouts for embodied navigation. Like post-training alignment in large language models,\nGrndCtrl\nleverages verifiable rewards to bridge generative pretraining and grounded behavior, achieving superior spatial coherence and navigation stability over supervised fine-tuning in outdoor environments.\n1\nCarnegie Mellon University\n2\nFieldAI\nFigure 1\n:\nReinforcement Learning with World Grounding (RLWG)\naddresses geometric inconsistencies in pretrained video world models through self-supervised post-training with verifiable rewards. Instead of reconstruction losses, RLWG grounds models using geometric and perceptual rewards from frozen evaluators.\nGrndCtrl\ninstantiates RLWG using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), enabling physically consistent rollouts essential for reliable world generation.\n1\nIntroduction\nLarge-scale video world models have emerged as powerful priors for modeling perception and control for embodied agents\n[\nnvidia2025cosmosworldfoundationmodel\n,\nbar2025navigationworldmodels\n,\nassran2025vjepa2\n,\njin2025posepilotsteeringcamerapose\n,\nren2025gen3c\n]\n. By learning to predict future observations from past frames and actions, these models approximate the transition dynamics of the physical world, enabling simulation, planning, and policy evaluation. Operating in the pixel domain aligns them with real-world sensors and exploits the vast implicit supervision available in video, allowing unified modeling across domains such as manipulation, driving, and navigation. Yet despite their impressive generative fidelity, these models are often incentivized to capture the appearance of motion more than its structure. Their rollouts remain visually plausible but geometrically and temporally inconsistent: poses drift, depths wobble, and trajectories lose alignment over time. Even subtle deviations in inferred geometry accumulate into compounding spatial errors corrupting metric structure. These instabilities limit the use of current models for closed-loop tasks such as localization, mapping, and planning, where physically consistent representation is essential.\nWe define\nworld model grounding\nas aligning learned dynamics with physically verifiable spatial and temporal invariants, so that rollouts honor geometry and time in addition to reproducing surface appearance. Grounding shifts the objective of world modeling from visual plausibility to structural consistency, ensuring that the model’s internal dynamics respect the constraints of real motion and scene structure. To this end, we introduce\nReinforcement Learning with World Grounding (RLWG)\n, a self-supervised post-training framework that refines pretrained world models using verifiable geometric and perceptual rewards derived from model rollouts. RLWG extends the principle of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) from language models\n[\nlambert2025tulu3pushingfrontiers\n]\nto the embodied domain, replacing text-based logical verification with geometric and temporal verification. In RLWG, a pretrained world model is treated as a policy that generates multiple candidate rollouts from the same context; each rollout is automatically scored using verifiable grounding rewards that quantify spatial and temporal coherence, such as pose cycle-consistency, depth reprojection agreement and action adherence. Unlike reconstruction losses that only penalize pixel error, these rewards measure physical correctness of the rollouts.\nTo optimize these verifiable rewards efficiently, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)\n[\nshao2024deepseekmathpushinglimitsmathematical\n]\nas our training mechanism, yielding our algorithm,\nGrndCtrl\n. For each context (and actions when available), the model generates a group of rollouts that are ranked by their grounding rewards; relative advantages are computed within the group, and the latent transition operator is updated using a clipped policy gradient objective regularized toward the pretrained model. This formulation preserves visual quality while progressively aligning the model’s dynamics with measurable structure in the real world. The process requires no human annotations or external simulators, operating entirely through self-supervised reinforcement grounded in the model’s own predictions. Conceptually,\nGrndCtrl\nextends the success of GRPO-based alignment in generative modeling to the geometric domain, grounding visual world models in verifiable 3D and temporal coherence.\nThis paradigm reframes the role of post-training in world modeling. Rather than optimizing for perceptual fidelity or next-frame likelihood, RLWG drives the model toward internal representations that are self-consistent and physically grounded. It establishes a structural analogue to the self-alignment processes that have improved reasoning in large language models: where RLVR grounds language in logic, RLWG grounds world models in geometry. The resulting models are self-grounded, spatially coherent, and dynamically stable—capable not only of rendering the world vividly, but of representing it in actionable, physically consistent form. Through this lens, we move beyond visually coherent generation toward structurally consistent simulation, bridging the gap between generative video modeling and physical world understanding, and opening a path toward world models that can both imagine and inhabit the real world.\nThe main contributions of this work are:\n1.\nWe introduce\nReinforcement Learning with World Grounding (RLWG)\n, a self-supervised grounding framework using verifiable geometric and temporal rewards from frozen evaluators without labels or simulators.\n2.\nWe construct\nGrndCtrl\n, a method that extends GRPO to the RLWG regime by multi-reward alignment over stochastic rollouts optimizing Translation, Rotation, Depth Temporal Reprojection Inlier ratio, and perceptual quality with pretrained frozen evaluators.\n3.\nWe provide a comprehensive evaluation of\nGrndCtrl\nacross multiple datasets showing reduced pose error means and variances, with strong gains under counterfactual rollouts and generalization to unseen inputs.\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\nControlling World Models\nRecent progress in large-scale video foundation models has transformed video prediction into controllable world simulation. Models such as Cosmos-Predict\n[\nnvidia2025cosmosworldfoundationmodel\n]\n, and V-JEPA\n[\nassran2025vjepa2\n]\nunify multi-modal conditioning for long-horizon prediction and control. These models achieve impressive simulation fidelity but still exhibit spatial drift, geometric misalignment, and temporal incoherence over extended rollouts, revealing limitations in geometric grounding. Architectural innovations like flow matching, conditional diffusion transformers, and masked latent prediction have improved realism but not physical consistency.\nControlling these models can be categorized into\naction-conditioned\nand\ncamera-conditioned\nparadigms. The first paradigm trains models to predict futures from discrete actions, and can be further defined by the nature of the action and observation frame. Some methods\n[\nzhou2025dinowmworldmodelspretrained\n,\nzhu2025unifiedworldmodelscoupling\n]\nassume a static camera observing an embodiment performing actions, while others\n[\nhafner2024masteringdiversedomainsworld\n,\nvalevski2025diffusionmodelsrealtimegame\n,\nbar2025navigationworldmodels\n,\nbai2025wholebodyconditionedegocentricvideo\n]\nassume a fixed camera on the embodiment and train models to predict ego-centric views. Jointly, they aim to enable model-predictive control, but face challenges with physical realism. The second paradigm explicitly decouples viewpoint from embodiment, allowing the model to generate future observations from arbitrary camera poses. Early works\n[\nwang2024motionctrlunifiedflexiblemotion\n,\nhe2025cameractrlenablingcameracontrol\n]\ninjected pose embeddings into diffusion models to achieve this control, but lacked explicit geometric alignment. Subsequent methods\n[\njin2025posepilotsteeringcamerapose\n,\nren2025gen3c\n]\nimproved consistency via self-supervised warping, 3D-informed point cloud conditioning, achieving more precise viewpoint control. Recent work\n[\nguo2025ctrlworldcontrollablegenerativeworld\n]\nbridges the two paradigms by jointly training on multiple viewpoints, and improved spatial-temporal consistency with pose-conditioned memory retrieval. Despite these advances, most approaches rely on supervised learning or one-step consistency objectives and remain open-loop, with no mechanism to evaluate or optimize physical correctness.\n2.2\nReward Learning for Post-Training\nReinforcement-based post-training has become central to aligning large generative models. In language systems, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)\n[\nouyang2022traininglanguagemodelsfollow\n]\nand Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)\n[\nlambert2025tulu3pushingfrontiers\n]\nreplace imitation with objective-driven alignment, while Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)\n[\nshao2024deepseekmathpushinglimitsmathematical\n]\nstabilizes learning via stochastic rollouts comparative updates. Extensions to vision, such as DanceGRPO\n[\nxue2025dancegrpounleashinggrpovisual\n]\n, demonstrate that rewards on visual quality can fine-tune video diffusion models effectively.\nBuilding on this foundation, RLWG adapts RLVR to world modeling, optimizing pretrained world models using physically verifiable rewards including cycle-consistency, depth reprojection, and trajectory stability.\nGrndCtrl\ninstantiates RLWG as a multi-objective GRPO over grounded rewards. This process enforces geometric coherence without human supervision, significantly reducing long-horizon drift. Parallel advances in 3D perception emphasize similar constraints: VGGT\n[\nwang2025vggt\n]\nand MapAnything\n[\nkeetha2025mapanythinguniversalfeedforwardmetric\n]\npredict depth and camera pose for consistent scene reconstruction, while SpaTracker\n[\nxiao2025spatialtrackerv23dpointtracking\n]\nintegrates rigidity priors for robust 3D tracking. Together, these efforts point toward reward-informed geometry as a unifying principle, where physical correctness acts as an alignment signal bridging generative modeling, simulation, and control.\nFigure 2\n:\nGrndCtrl\nframework architecture.

(b)\nGrndCtrl\nsuccessfully follows directionally inverted actions, generating geometrically consistent rollouts where baseline fails.\n4.1\nDatasets\nWe train and evaluate our methods on three datasets spanning diverse embodiments and scenarios.\nCODa\n[\nzhang2023towards\n]\nis a campus navigation dataset collected on wheeled robots with pseudo-ground truth poses.\nSCAND\n[\nkarnan2022sociallycompliantnavigationdataset\n]\nis a social navigation dataset also collected on campus, featuring embodiments of both a wheeled robot and a quadruped.\nCityWalk\n[\nliu2025citywalker\n]\nis an egocentric urban navigation dataset of a person walking in crowded city streets, collected from in-the-wild YouTube city walking videos and reprocessed with MapAnything\n[\nkeetha2025mapanythinguniversalfeedforwardmetric\n]\nto obtain pose estimates. We subsample each dataset to 2k non-overlapping 13-frame sequences of pose-action pairs for training, ensuring temporal diversity and avoiding data leakage.\n4.2\nBaseline Model\nWe obtain the baseline pretrained world model\nW\nθ\nW_{\\theta}\nvia supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on Cosmos-Predict2-2B-Video2World\n[\nnvidia2025cosmosworldfoundationmodel\n]\n, a diffusion model with a latent VAE backbone and temporal attention. We use a modified version of its action-conditioned video predictor post-training pipeline, adapting the action space from 7 to 6 degrees of freedom to match our navigation setting:\n(\nx\n,\ny\n,\nz\n,\nroll\n,\npitch\n,\nyaw\n)\n(x,y,z,\\mathrm{roll},\\mathrm{pitch},\\mathrm{yaw})\nas 6×12 action embeddings. We initialize the action embeddings randomly while fine-tuning the entire DiT backbone for 20k steps with an effective batch size of 64. Training follows the EDM framework\n[\nkarras2022elucidatingdesignspacediffusionbased\n,\nkarras2024analyzingimprovingtrainingdynamics\n]\n, using the weighted expectation of denoising score matching loss over noise levels. We perform full SFT over all DiT backbone parameters keeping the visual encoder and decoder frozen, as our experiments showed that only full SFT or full-size LoRA yielded meaningful changes in motion dynamics. Additional implementation details are provided in Appendix.\n4.3\nGRPO Post-Training\nPost-training applies GRPO with self-supervised verifiable rewards as described in Sec.\n3.3\n. We use MapAnything\n[\nkeetha2025mapanythinguniversalfeedforwardmetric\n]\nas\nℰ\n\\mathcal{E}\nto obtain rewards\nr\ntrans\nr_{\\text{trans}}\n,\nr\nrot\nr_{\\text{rot}}\n, and\nr\ndtr\nr_{\\text{dtr}}\n. We use VideoAlign\n[\nliu2025improving\n]\nas\n𝒱\n\\mathcal{V}\nto obtain the reward\nr\nv\nr_{\\text{v}}\n. We perform an ablation study of combinatorial rewards as defined in Sec.\n3.2\nto evaluate multi-objective GRPO. For each reward configuration, we train for 100 steps with an effective batch size of 8, generating\nG\n=\n8\nG=8\nstochastic rollouts\n{\nx\n^\n1\n:\nT\n(\ni\n)\n}\ni\n=\n1\nG\n\\{\\hat{x}^{(i)}_{1:T}\\}_{i=1}^{G}\nper conditioning context\nc\n=\n(\nx\n0\n,\na\n0\n:\nT\n−\n1\n)\nc=(x_{0},a_{0:T-1})\n. To obtain diverse rollouts, we use the same initial noise for reverse-SDE diffusion with the same starting frame\nx\n0\nx_{0}\nand action trajectory\na\n0\n:\nT\n−\n1\na_{0:T-1}\n, but inject stochastic Brownian noise at each diffusion step as described in Sec.\n3.3\n. We compute per-step likelihood ratios only over the first 60% of diffusion timesteps to focus training on the most relevant denoising steps to improve training stability. Additional training details are provided in Appendix.\n4.4\nEvaluation Regimes\nWe evaluate on three regimes that progressively test generalization capabilities:\n•\nSeen\n: Start frames and scene domains seen during SFT with matching action distributions. This regime tests in-distribution performance.\n•\nCounterfactual\n: Scenes seen during SFT but with counterfactual actions (e.g., mirrored or directionally inverted action sequences). This regime tests the model’s ability to extrapolate geometric structure to novel motion patterns.\n•\nUnseen\n: Both scenes and actions novel at test time, with scenes from different domains and action sequences with different motion characteristics. This regime tests full generalization to unseen scenarios.\n4.5\nMetrics\nWe report four metrics averaged across an evaluation set of 200 non-overlapping sequences for each regime: Translation error (\nT\n=\n−\nr\ntrans\n\\text{T}=-r_{\\text{trans}}\n) in meters, Rotation error (\nR\n=\n−\nr\nrot\n\\text{R}=-r_{\\text{rot}}\n) in radians, Video Quality (\nV\n=\nr\nv\n\\text{V}=r_{\\text{v}}\n) combining visual and motion quality scores, and Depth Temporal Reprojection Inlier Ratio (\nDTRI\n=\nr\ndtr\n\\text{DTRI}=r_{\\text{dtr}}\n) as a percentage. Lower values indicate better performance for T and R, while higher values are better for V and DTRI.\n5\nAnalysis and Discussion\nSeen\nCounterfactual\nUnseen\nMethod\nT\n↓\nT\\downarrow\nR\n↓\nR\\downarrow\nV\n↑\nV\\uparrow\nDTRI\n↑\n\\uparrow\nT\n↓\nT\\downarrow\nR\n↓\nR\\downarrow\nV\n↑\nV\\uparrow\nDTRI\n↑\n\\uparrow\nT\n↓\nT\\downarrow\nR\n↓\nR\\downarrow\nV\n↑\nV\\uparrow\nDTRI\n↑\n\\uparrow\nCODa\n[\nzhang2023towards\n]\nBaseline\n[\nnvidia2025cosmosworldfoundationmodel\n]\n57.8\n57.8\n1.77\n1.77\n7.40\n7.40\n38.9\n38.9\n71.5\n71.5\n1.55\n1.55\n7.41\n7.41\n39.1\n39.1\n56.9\n56.9\n1.71\n1.71\n7.40\n7.40\n38.3\n38.3\n+T+R\n46.4\n46.4\n1.44\n1.44\n7.32\n7.32\n38.4\n38.4\n50.5\n50.5\n1.53\n1.53\n7.34\n7.34\n38.7\n38.7\n54.3\n54.3\n1.75\n1.75\n7.36\n7.36\n39.3\n39.3\n+T+R+DTRI\n65.7\n65.7\n1.74\n1.74\n7.43\n7.43\n37.0\n37.0\n57.7\n57.7\n1.86\n1.86\n7.42\n7.42\n36.8\n36.8\n42.6\n42.6\n1.74\n1.74\n7.40\n7.40\n37.1\n37.1\n+T+R+DTRI+V\n39.9\n39.9\n1.27\n1.27\n7.35\n7.35\n37.5\n37.5\n40.7\n40.7\n1.42\n1.42\n7.34\n7.34\n37.4\n37.4\n31.0\n31.0\n1.53\n1.53\n7.37\n7.37\n38.0\n38.0\nSCAND\n[\nkarnan2022sociallycompliantnavigationdataset\n]\nBaseline\n[\nnvidia2025cosmosworldfoundationmodel\n]\n186.3\n186.3\n3.76\n3.76\n7.16\n7.16\n23.6\n23.6\n315.9\n315.9\n4.24\n4.24\n7.13\n7.13\n21.4\n21.4\n117.0\n117.0\n4.02\n4.02\n6.99\n6.99\n18.4\n18.4\n+T+R\n158.2\n158.2\n3.61\n3.61\n7.19\n7.19\n23.7\n23.7\n251.2\n251.2\n4.34\n4.34\n7.18\n7.18\n21.7\n21.7\n131.1\n131.1\n3.95\n3.95\n7.04\n7.04\n19.1\n19.1\n+T+R+DTRI\n157.9\n157.9\n3.65\n3.65\n7.10\n7.10\n22.1\n22.1\n288.6\n288.6\n4.45\n4.45\n7.17\n7.17\n20.1\n20.1\n118.6\n118.6\n4.07\n4.07\n7.03\n7.03\n17.9\n17.9\n+T+R+DTRI+V\n133.4\n133.4\n3.30\n3.30\n7.11\n7.11\n24.5\n24.5\n220.1\n220.1\n4.23\n4.23\n7.08\n7.08\n22.8\n22.8\n123.4\n123.4\n3.62\n3.62\n6.98\n6.98\n19.4\n19.4\nCityWalk\n[\nliu2025citywalker\n]\nBaseline\n[\nnvidia2025cosmosworldfoundationmodel\n]\n11.7\n11.7\n3.13\n3.13\n7.96\n7.96\n46.9\n46.9\n13.1\n13.1\n3.27\n3.27\n7.94\n7.94\n47.4\n47.4\n20.8\n20.8\n4.47\n4.47\n7.90\n7.90\n44.5\n44.5\n+T+R\n8.9\n8.9\n3.31\n3.31\n7.90\n7.90\n44.9\n44.9\n4.8\n4.8\n4.42\n4.42\n7.91\n7.91\n45.6\n45.6\n10.2\n10.2\n3.47\n3.47\n7.87\n7.87\n42.8\n42.8\n+T+R+DTRI\n8.4\n8.4\n3.36\n3.36\n7.84\n7.84\n43.5\n43.5\n4.7\n4.7\n4.40\n4.40\n7.83\n7.83\n44.1\n44.1\n10.9\n10.9\n3.68\n3.68\n7.79\n7.79\n41.4\n41.4\n+T+R+DTRI+V\n8.8\n8.8\n3.37\n3.37\n7.84\n7.84\n42.6\n42.6\n4.7\n4.7\n4.37\n4.37\n7.85\n7.85\n43.3\n43.3\n9.9\n9.9\n3.74\n3.74\n7.80\n7.80\n40.8\n40.8\nTable 1\n:\nQuantitative evaluation across three datasets (\nCODa\n,\nSCAND\n,\nCityWalk\n) and three regimes:\nSeen\n,\nCounterfactual\n, and\nUnseen\n. We compare baseline against progressive reward combinations (T+R, T+R+DTRI, T+R+DTRI+V).\nGrndCtrl\nachieves substantial improvements. Metrics: T (Translation Error, m), R (Rotation Error, rad), V (Video Quality), DTRI (Depth Temporal Reprojection Inliers).\n5.1\nImpact of\nGrndCtrl\non World Model Failures\nO1: Baselines show poor counterfactual performance but good generalization within familiar motion manifolds.\nTable\n1\nreports quantitative results on CODa, SCAND, and CityWalk datasets across three evaluation regimes. Across all datasets, the baseline performs well in Seen but degrades significantly in Counterfactual, indicating limited transfer to out-of-distribution action sequences. On CODa, baseline translation error increases by\n24\n%\n24\\%\nfrom Seen to Counterfactual, while on SCAND the degradation is more severe, increasing by\n70\n%\n70\\%\n. On CityWalk, the increase is more modest at\n12\n%\n12\\%\n. Unseen performance, however, remains comparable to Seen across datasets, suggesting that the pretrained model does generalize within familiar motion manifolds. This contrast in performance between Counterfactual and Unseen indicates a fundamental limitation in pretrained video world model’s ability to extrapolate geometric structure to counterfactual rollouts, a key property expected of grounded world simulators.\nO2: Translation and rotation rewards improve spatial alignment with largest gains under counterfactual motion.\nIntroducing translation and rotation rewards\nr\ntrans\nr_{\\text{trans}}\nand\nr\nrot\nr_{\\text{rot}}\n(\nT+R\n) improves spatial alignment across all datasets. On CODa, T+R decreases translation error by\n20\n%\n20\\%\nin Seen and by\n29\n%\n29\\%\nin Counterfactual relative to baseline, while rotation error improves by\n19\n%\n19\\%\nin Seen. On SCAND, the improvements are substantial: translation error decreases by\n15\n%\n15\\%\nin Seen and by\n20\n%\n20\\%\nin Counterfactual, with rotation error improving by\n4\n%\n4\\%\nin Seen. CityWalk shows the strongest counterfactual gains, with Counterfactual translation error dropping by\n63\n%\n63\\%\nrelative to baseline, while Seen improves by\n24\n%\n24\\%\n. These results demonstrate that explicit pose-based feedback enhances motion consistency and stabilizes rollouts\nx\n^\n1\n:\nT\n\\hat{x}_{1:T}\nacross diverse embodiments. Notably, the improvement in Counterfactual highlights that verifiable motion alignment encourages generalization to directionally inverted action sequences\na\n0\n:\nT\n−\n1\na_{0:T-1}\n, an essential feature for embodied reasoning.\nTable\n2\nfurther demonstrates that GRPO training systematically improves model reliability: the baseline model shows high variance across both translation and rotation errors, indicating unstable rollouts sensitive to diffusion noise. With\nGrndCtrl\ntraining, both mean errors and variance decrease substantially: at 200 iterations, translation error means reduce by\n77\n%\n77\\%\nrelative to baseline across experiments, with standard deviations reduced by\n75\n%\n75\\%\n. Rotation error also improves, with means reducing by 39% and standard deviations reduced by\n32\n%\n32\\%\n, achieving reliable and consistent rollouts across all evaluation regimes.\nSeen\nCounterfactual\nUnseen\nMethod\nT\n↓\nT\\downarrow\nR\n↓\nR\\downarrow\nT\n↓\nT\\downarrow\nR\n↓\nR\\downarrow\nT\n↓\nT\\downarrow\nR\n↓\nR\\downarrow\nBaseline\n[\nnvidia2025cosmosworldfoundationmodel\n]\n73.2\n±\n243.7\n73.2\\pm 243.7\n2.38\n±\n3.88\n2.38\\pm 3.88\n75.8\n±\n253.9\n75.8\\pm 253.9\n2.38\n±\n3.90\n2.38\\pm 3.90\n71.2\n±\n251.2\n71.2\\pm 251.2\n2.88\n±\n4.28\n2.88\\pm 4.28\nGrndCtrl\nT+R 100\n72.0\n±\n283.6\n72.0\\pm 283.6\n1.95\n±\n3.38\n1.95\\pm 3.38\n75.9\n±\n311.7\n75.9\\pm 311.7\n1.85\n±\n3.22\n1.85\\pm 3.22\n58.4\n±\n231.1\n58.4\\pm 231.1\n2.57\n±\n4.08\n2.57\\pm 4.08\nGrndCtrl\nT+R 150\n26.7\n±\n101.5\n26.7\\pm 101.5\n1.54\n±\n2.84\n1.54\\pm 2.84\n24.8\n±\n99.1\n24.8\\pm 99.1\n1.53\n±\n2.80\n1.53\\pm 2.80\n26.5\n±\n104.3\n26.5\\pm 104.3\n2.08\n±\n3.33\n2.08\\pm 3.33\nGrndCtrl\nT+R 200\n18.4\n±\n68.1\n18.4\\pm 68.1\n1.40\n±\n2.49\n1.40\\pm 2.49\n16.8\n±\n63.0\n16.8\\pm 63.0\n1.36\n±\n2.57\n1.36\\pm 2.57\n16.3\n±\n56.5\n16.3\\pm 56.5\n1.97\n±\n3.11\n1.97\\pm 3.11\nTable 2\n:\nReliability analysis showing error statistics (mean\n±\n\\pm\nstandard deviation) across multiple stochastic rollouts for different GRPO iterations.

On CODa, compared to T+R, translation error increases by\n42\n%\n42\\%\nin Seen and by\n14\n%\n14\\%\nin Counterfactual, while Unseen benefits substantially with a\n22\n%\n22\\%\nimprovement. On SCAND, Seen shows minimal change, Counterfactual degrades by\n15\n%\n15\\%\n, while Unseen improves by\n10\n%\n10\\%\n. CityWalk shows a different pattern where DTRI maintains or slightly improves performance across most regimes. This suggests the depth reward enforces short-horizon consistency and local geometric smoothness, with benefits most apparent in unseen scenarios.\nO4: Full reward set produces most balanced and robust performance.\nIncorporating perceptual feedback through the full reward set (\nT+R+DTRI+V\n) produces the most balanced and robust performance across all datasets. On CODa, the full objective achieves translation error reductions of\n31\n%\n31\\%\n(Seen),\n43\n%\n43\\%\n(Counterfactual), and\n45\n%\n45\\%\n(Unseen) relative to baseline, with rotation error improving by\n28\n%\n28\\%\n(Seen),\n8\n%\n8\\%\n(Counterfactual), and\n11\n%\n11\\%\n(Unseen). On SCAND, translation error reduces by\n28\n%\n28\\%\n(Seen),\n30\n%\n30\\%\n(Counterfactual), and\n5\n%\n5\\%\n(Unseen), while CityWalk shows consistent improvements with Counterfactual achieving a\n64\n%\n64\\%\nreduction. The full objective recovers and extends the rollout accuracy of T+R while preserving local stability from DTRI. Perceptual alignment via video-based evaluators acts as a long-horizon stabilizer, promoting rollouts that are both physically consistent and visually coherent.\nFigure\n3\nshowcases qualitative comparisons of\nGrndCtrl\nrollouts\nx\n^\n1\n:\nT\n\\hat{x}_{1:T}\nagainst the baseline.\nGrndCtrl\nsignificantly mitigates the scene drift failures frequently observed when queried with mirrored input action sequences\na\n0\n:\nT\n−\n1\na_{0:T-1}\n, and improves rollout consistency.\n5.2\nTraining Insights and Stability\nI1: Pretraining bias requires full fine-tuning for meaningful motion adaptation.\nCosmos-Predict2’s pretraining on videos with mostly short clips and slight forward movements biases the model toward scene stability over dynamics. This pretraining bias explains why we observed negligible changes in motion behavior when using parameter-efficient methods like LoRA (except full-size variants), suggesting that pretrained world models may require substantial capacity updates to adapt to navigation-specific action distributions.\nI2: Early diffusion timesteps are most critical for GRPO training stability.\nGrndCtrl\ntraining is significantly more memory intensive than SFT, as it requires maintaining computation graphs over all diffusion steps to track per-timestep log-probabilities for likelihood ratio computation. Early timesteps are primarily responsible for content denoising while later timesteps refine details with exponentially smaller likelihood values, making the 60% timestep limitation both memory-efficient and beneficial for training stability by focusing on the most relevant denoising steps.\nI3:\nGrndCtrl\nrequires sufficient reward variance and careful checkpoint selection.\nMost critically,\nGrndCtrl\ntraining stability depends on having sufficient reward variance across stochastic rollouts.\nGrndCtrl\nfocuses optimization on the reward component with highest variance within each group, which is beneficial for addressing scene drift when some rollouts fail visual odometry while others succeed. However, when checkpoints are overfitted or undertrained, producing uniformly poor or uniformly good rollouts, the normalization step in advantage calculation can amplify subtle differences, leading to degraded training where the model learns arbitrary patterns that add noise to predictions. We mitigate this through KL regularization toward the pretrained model and careful checkpoint selection, ensuring the baseline checkpoint generates distinguishably good and bad rollouts before applying GRPO.\n6\nLimitations\nRLWG introduces a new paradigm for grounding world models using verifiable rewards, and our study focuses on establishing core principles rather than exhaustively scaling the approach. Our experiments use moderate budgets and limited datasets, but already demonstrate that meaningful grounding can be achieved efficiently. A practical constraint of\nGrndCtrl\nis its reliance on sufficient rollout variance for stable relative-policy optimization; understanding the variance dynamics of reward-aligned world model training remains an open direction. Additionally, while RLWG optimizes a multi-objective reward, we do not explore alternative weighting strategies or adaptive weighting schemes, which could further shape the trade-off between global alignment, local consistency, and visual fidelity. Investigating principled multi-reward weighting and larger-scale training holds promise for pushing RLWG toward increasingly stable, generalizable, and physically grounded world models.\n7\nConclusions\nOur work demonstrates that\nRLWG\nenables pretrained video world models to be effectively grounded in physical structure through self-supervised post-training, without requiring human labels or external simulators. Instantiated as\nGrndCtrl\n, the key insight is that verifiable geometric and perceptual rewards, when optimized via relative policy methods, systematically improve spatial coherence while preserving the visual quality that makes these models powerful priors. The most significant improvements emerge under counterfactual scenarios.\nGrndCtrl\nachieves substantial improvements under counterfactual rollouts, with up to\n64\n%\n64\\%\nreduction in translation error, demonstrating that reward-based alignment addresses a fundamental limitation of current world models: their tendency to prioritize visual plausibility over structural consistency. By explicitly optimizing for both,\nRLWG\nenables models that are not only visually coherent but also geometrically consistent, opening new possibilities for reliable long-horizon planning and control in real-world environments.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank NVIDIA and the authors of Cosmos-Predict2\n[\nnvidia2025cosmosworldfoundationmodel\n]\nfor publicly releasing their code and checkpoints, upon which we build our post-training pipeline.

The counterfactual rollouts of\nGrndCtrl\nand baseline are expected to mirror the trajectory shown in ground truths in each scene. We observe\nGrndCtrl\nimproves trajectory-following and mitigates scene drift in counterfactual rollouts in all three datasets.\nFigure 4\n:\nCounterfactual generation example in SCAND. Baseline and\nGrndCtrl\nare conditioned on left-right mirrored actions, and the rollouts are expected to invert the movements of the ground truth. Baseline generation still follows similar left-forward movement as GT (trajectory-following failure), while\nGrndCtrl\ngeneration successfully follow inverted right-forward movement.\nFigure 5\n:\nCounterfactual generation example in CityWalk. Baseline and\nGrndCtrl\nare conditioned on left-right mirrored actions, and the rollouts are expected to invert the movements of the ground truth. Baseline generation still follows similar left-turn movement as GT (trajectory-following failure), while\nGrndCtrl\ngeneration successfully follow inverted right-turn movement.\nAppendix B\nComparisons with NWM\n[\nbar2025navigationworldmodels\n]\nWhile RLWG is a post-training framework agnostic to the baseline world model, and in\nGrndCtrl\nwe obtain the baseline with supervised fine-tuning, we acknowledge other potential candidates that perform similar tasks as an experimental baseline. This is exemplified by NWM\n[\nbar2025navigationworldmodels\n]\n, which operates a similar world models scenario in navigation tasks. However, significant differences in experimental settings between\nGrndCtrl\nand NWM results in infeasible quantitative comparisons:\n•\nNWM is jointly-trained on multiple datasets, including RECON\n[\nshah2021rapid\n]\nand HuRoN\n[\nhirose2023sacson\n]\n, which are collected using fish-eye cameras. This results in frequent twisted artifacts in rollouts conditioned on rectilinear images such as SCAND\n[\nkarnan2022sociallycompliantnavigationdataset\n]\n. This biases NWM to perform poorly with visual odometry metrics based on a\nfeed-forward 3D evaluator\nsuch as MapAnything\n[\nkeetha2025mapanythinguniversalfeedforwardmetric\n]\n.\n•\nGrndCtrl\nis conditioned on actions defined in 6-DOF space\n(\nx\n,\ny\n,\nz\n,\nroll\n,\npitch\n,\nyaw\n)\n(x,y,z,\\mathrm{roll},\\mathrm{pitch},\\mathrm{yaw})\n, whereas NWM’s actions are simplified to 3-DOF space\n(\nx\n,\ny\n,\nyaw\n)\n(x,y,\\mathrm{yaw})\n.\nSince\nGrndCtrl\nadopts MapAnything as an evaluator to obtain rewards, we are unable to directly use NWM as our baseline pretrained world model\nW\nθ\nW_{\\theta}\n. Nevertheless, we include qualitative samples of NWM counterfactual rollouts in Figure\n6\n. We used the same image-action sequences from Figures\n4\nin SCAND, the dataset shared by both our experiments and NWM. We used 3-DOF actions as conditions, then performed the same inversion for the rest of the trajectory in 3-DOF to generate counterfactual rollouts. We observe similar failures in scene drift and trajectory-following.\nFigure 6\n:\nCounterfactual generation example in SCAND. NWM and\nGrndCtrl\nare conditioned on left-right mirrored actions, and the rollouts are expected to invert the movements of the ground truth. NWM generation shows clear sign of scene drift in frames 1-3, ending in a more consistent but different scene than the conditional image.\nAppendix C\nFailure Modes\nWhile\nGrndCtrl\ndemonstrates meaningful grounding in world models, we identify three main failure modes.\nFirst, the lack of pixel-level supervision in our post-training results in gradual increase in pixel-level noises in our rollouts. While we mitigate this with KL-regularization towards the pretrained model, we still observe a gradual increase in visual noises as our post-training increases overall rewards with by improving trajectory-following or mitigating scene drift in rollouts. When unconstrained in post-training iterations, the added visual noise may eventually exceed the noise tolerance of the\nfeed-forward 3D evaluator\n, resulting in invalid rewards used for training, and the model rollouts gradually collapse to pure noises.\nSecond, when a set of rollouts produce similarly good or similarly bad results, our multi-objective normalized group advantage treats the slightly worse good results as negative samples, or the slightly better bad results as positive samples. This results in counterproductive learning in post-training, which causes training instability and gradual collapse to noises. We leave the investigation of rollout variance in world models as future work.\nThird, we occasionally observe reward-hacking behaviors, where rewards increase despite generating noises. Due to the black-box nature of the evaluators and our pipeline stochasticity, we mitigate this by retraining.\nAppendix D\nImplementation Details\nWe first describe supervised fine-tuning of the baseline world model, followed by GRPO post-training and the evaluator setup. Table\n3\nsummarizes the key hyperparameters used in both stages.\nD.1\nSupervised Fine-Tuning\nWe fine-tune the Cosmos-Predict2-2B Video2World backbone starting from the released 2B-720p-16fps checkpoint. The visual encoder and decoder of the latent VAE are kept frozen, and we update all parameters in the DiT backbone.\nBefore settling on this configuration, we experimented with several alternatives: (i) full supervised fine-tuning (all DiT parameters), (ii) LoRA with ranks\n16\n16\nand\n64\n64\n, (iii) a full-size LoRA configuration with\n2048\n×\n2048\n2048\\times 2048\nhidden states, and (iv) training only the action embeddings. Due to Cosmos-Predict2’s large-scale pretraining on short clips with mostly mild forward motion, the model is strongly biased toward scene stability rather than rich trajectory dynamics. In practice, only full SFT and the full-size LoRA variant produced meaningful changes in motion behavior; lower-rank LoRA and action-only updates had negligible effect. For simplicity and robustness, we therefore adopt full SFT for all reported experiments.\nSupervision is applied in the latent space using an MSE loss with EDM regularization. During SFT, we perform single-step diffusion and backpropagate only through the DiT backbone, which keeps training computationally efficient. We train for\n20\n20\nk steps with Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) across eight A100 GPUs. All remaining optimization and diffusion hyperparameters follow the default action-conditioned Cosmos-Predict2 post-training configuration and are listed in Table\n3\n.\nD.2\nGRPO Post-Training\nGRPO post-training is substantially more GPU-memory intensive than SFT because it requires multiple full video rollouts\nx\n^\n1\n:\nT\n\\hat{x}_{1:T}\nper conditioning context while maintaining computation graphs over all diffusion steps to track per-timestep log-probabilities. To fit within memory constraints, we train with a batch size of\n1\n1\nper GPU on eight A100 GPUs and compensate by sampling\nG\n=\n8\nG=8\nstochastic rollouts for each context\nc\n=\n(\nx\n0\n,\na\n0\n:\nT\n−\n1\n)\nc=(x_{0},a_{0:T-1})\n, which provides sufficient diversity for group-relative advantage estimation.\nA single GRPO update accumulates gradients through the diffusion trajectory to compute per-step likelihood ratios. However, diffusion timesteps do not contribute equally: early steps primarily denoise the main scene content, whereas later steps refine fine-grained details and contribute exponentially smaller likelihood values. Computing likelihood ratios over all steps causes the cumulative log-likelihood to vanish and destabilizes training. In practice, we compute the per-step likelihood ratio only over the first\n60\n%\n60\\%\nof diffusion timesteps while still running the full sampler, which improves both numerical stability and memory efficiency.\nComponent\nHyperparameter\nValue\nOptimization\nSFT/GRPO\nOptimizer\nfused AdamW\nSFT/GRPO\nLearning rate\n1.0\n×\n10\n−\n4\n1.0\\times 10^{-4}\nSFT/GRPO\nWeight decay\n0.1\n0.1\nSFT/GRPO\nBetas\n(\n0.9\n,\n0.99\n)\n(0.9,0.99)\nSFT/GRPO\nEpsilon\n1.0\n×\n10\n−\n8\n1.0\\times 10^{-8}\nSFT/GRPO\nLR schedule\nconstant\nDiffusion and sampling\nSFT/GRPO\nPrecision\nbfloat16\nSFT\nClassifier-free guidance\n7.0\n7.0\nSFT/GRPO\nDiffusion timesteps\n35\n35\nSFT\nEDM loss scale\n10.0\n10.0\nSFT\nEDM\nσ\ncond\n\\sigma_{\\text{cond}}\n1.0\n×\n10\n−\n4\n1.0\\times 10^{-4}\nSFT\nEDM\nσ\ndata\n\\sigma_{\\text{data}}\n1.0\n1.0\nSFT\nEDM high-\nσ\n\\sigma\nratio\n0.0\n0.0\nGRPO\nClassifier-free guidance\n0.0\n0.0\nGRPO\nTimesteps backpropagated\n21\n21\nBatching and hardware\nSFT/GRPO\nGPUs\n8\n×\n8\\times\nA100\nSFT\nBatch size / GPU\n8\n8\nSFT\nEffective batch size\n64\n64\nGRPO\nBatch size / GPU\n1\n1\nGRPO\nEffective batch size\n8\n8\nGRPO\nRollouts per context\nG\nG\n8\n8\nTable 3:\nKey hyperparameters for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and GRPO post-training.\nD.3\nCounterfactual Actions\nWe define the action conditioning of our model as\n(\nx\n,\ny\n,\nz\n,\nroll\n,\npitch\n,\nyaw\n)\n(x,y,z,\\mathrm{roll},\\mathrm{pitch},\\mathrm{yaw})\n. In practice, we use the absolute poses with respect to the conditional image’s camera frame for each frame we generate. We follow the standard camera coordinate convention with\nx\nx\nright,\ny\ny\ndown, and\nz\nz\nforward.\nWe perform left-right mirroring of the ground truth actions to obtain the counterfactual actions. Mirroring a trajectory with respect to the image center corresponds to reflecting motion across the plane\nx\n=\n0\nx=0\nand flipping the viewing direction around the optical axis. For the translational part, this reflection is\n(\nx\n,\ny\n,\nz\n)\n⊤\n↦\n(\n−\nx\n,\ny\n,\nz\n)\n⊤\n(x,y,z)^{\\top}\\;\\mapsto\\;(-x,y,z)^{\\top}\n, which inverts only the lateral component. For small angular magnitudes, the viewing direction can be linearized as\n𝐝\n​\n(\npitch\n,\nyaw\n)\n≈\n(\nyaw\n,\npitch\n,\n1\n)\n⊤\n\\mathbf{d}(\\mathrm{pitch},\\mathrm{yaw})\\approx(\\mathrm{yaw},\\mathrm{pitch},1)^{\\top}\n, so mirroring around the optical axis sends\n𝐝\n↦\n(\n−\nyaw\n,\n−\npitch\n,\n1\n)\n⊤\n\\mathbf{d}\\mapsto(-\\mathrm{yaw},-\\mathrm{pitch},1)^{\\top}\n, corresponding to\n(\npitch\n,\nyaw\n)\n↦\n(\n−\npitch\n,\n−\nyaw\n)\n(\\mathrm{pitch},\\mathrm{yaw})\\mapsto(-\\mathrm{pitch},-\\mathrm{yaw})\n. Combining these, a 6-DOF action\n(\nx\n,\ny\n,\nz\n,\nroll\n,\npitch\n,\nyaw\n)\n(x,y,z,\\mathrm{roll},\\mathrm{pitch},\\mathrm{yaw})\nhas the counterfactual action\n(\n−\nx\n,\ny\n,\nz\n,\nroll\n,\n−\npitch\n,\n−\nyaw\n)\n(-x,y,z,\\mathrm{roll},-\\mathrm{pitch},-\\mathrm{yaw})\n,\nwhich is the mirror of the original motion with respect to the conditioning image’s center axis.\nThis method of obtaining counterfactual actions ensure realistic movement of the embodiment as those in the datasets. When conditioning using arbitrary actions, the model rollouts from the pretrained model are more likely to have poorer quality.\nD.4\nEvaluators and Rewards\nMapAnything\n[\nkeetha2025mapanythinguniversalfeedforwardmetric\n]\nserves as our frozen 3D evaluator\nE\nE\n, providing relative pose estimates\n(\nΔ\n​\nR\nt\n,\nΔ\n​\n𝐭\nt\n)\n(\\Delta R_{t},\\Delta\\mathbf{t}_{t})\nand per-frame depth maps\nD\nt\nD_{t}\nfor each rollout\nx\n^\n1\n:\nT\n\\hat{x}_{1:T}\n.

We introduce Reinforcement Learning with World Grounding (RLWG), a self-supervised post-training framework that aligns pretrained world models with a physically verifiable structure through geometric and perceptual rewards. Analogous to reinforcement learning from verifiable feedback (RLVR) in language models, RLWG can use multiple rewards that measure pose cycle-consistency, depth reprojection, and temporal coherence.

            "answer": "## 论文前作分析\n\n根据论文内容，**GrndCtrl** 的核心框架 **RLWG** 和算法 **GrndCtrl** 本身是本文提出的新方法。因此，这里分析的“前作”主要指论文中引用的、为本文提供理论基础和技术组件的关键相关工作，特别是作者团队或紧密相关的研究。论文并未明确列出同一作者团队的系列前作，但通过分析引用，可以梳理出其技术演进脉络。\n\n以下表格总结了与本文**GrndCtrl**直接相关的主要前作、它们的核心思想，以及**GrndCtrl**相对于这些工作的主要区别与改进。\n\n| 前作名称 / 类别 | 核心思想与技术 | 与 GrndCtrl 的主要区别 | GrndCtrl 的主要改善与创新 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Cosmos-Predict / V-JEPA 等大规模视频世界模型** (如 `[nvidia2025cosmosworldfoundationmodel]`, `[assran2025vjepa2]`) | **基础模型**：通过在大规模视频数据上进行生成式预训练（如下一帧预测、掩码预测），学习环境的动态先验，用于仿真、规划和策略评估。关注**视觉逼真度**和像素级预测。 | 1. **目标不同**：前作主要优化**视觉 plausibility** 和重建损失。2. **问题**：生成的轨迹存在**几何不一致性**（位姿漂移、深度抖动），缺乏物理可验证的 grounding，限制了在需要长时程稳定性的导航等任务中的应用。 | **从生成到 grounding**：GrndCtrl 不改变基础模型的架构，而是通过**后训练对齐**，将目标从“看起来像”转变为“结构上正确”。它引入了可验证的几何奖励来显式优化物理一致性，解决了前作模型在长时程和反事实 rollouts 中不稳定的根本问题。 |\n| **Camera Control / PosePilot 等相机控制方法** (如 `[he2025cameractrlenablingcameracontrol]`, `[jin2025posepilotsteeringcamerapose]`) | **控制范式**：通过向扩散模型中注入位姿嵌入，实现从任意相机位姿生成未来观测。部分工作通过自监督扭曲、3D点云条件化来提升一致性。 | 1. **方法局限**：大多基于**监督学习**或**单步一致性目标**。2. **系统局限**：是**开环**的，缺乏对生成序列整体物理正确性的评估和优化机制。 | **从开环到闭环优化**：GrndCtrl 提出了一个**闭环的后训练框架**。它不是一次性生成，而是生成多个随机rollout，用冻结评估器计算其物理正确性（奖励），并通过强化学习进行迭代优化。这实现了对长序列**整体时空一致性**的显式优化。 |\n| **Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)** (如 `[lambert2025tulu3pushingfrontiers]`) | **对齐范式**：源于大语言模型领域。使用**可验证的奖励**（如代码执行正确性、数学解题步骤）对预训练模型进行后训练对齐，替代或补充人类反馈（RLHF）。 | **领域不同**：RLVR 应用于**语言领域**，奖励基于逻辑和代码执行验证。 | **从语言到具身**：GrndCtrl 将 RLVR 的核心思想**创新性地迁移到视觉和具身领域**。它定义了适用于世界模型的**几何和感知可验证奖励**（如位姿循环一致性、深度重投影），建立了“用物理正确性作为对齐信号”的新范式。 |\n| **Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)** (如 `[shao2024deepseekmathpushinglimitsmathematical]`, `[xue2025dancegrpounleashinggrpovisual]`) | **优化算法**：一种稳定的强化学习优化方法。通过在同一上下文中生成一组随机样本，计算组内相对优势来更新策略，避免了绝对值奖励的估计难题。已成功用于数学推理和视频质量微调。 | **应用场景**：前作主要应用于**语言推理**或**视频美学质量**的优化。 | **算法的新应用与扩展**：GrndCtrl 是**首次将 GRPO 系统性地应用于优化世界模型的几何属性**。它将 GRPO 与多目标、可验证的几何奖励相结合，处理连续视频生成任务中的策略优化稳定性问题，并针对扩散模型采样特性进行了调整（如仅对前60%去噪步计算似然比）。 |\n| **MapAnything / VGGT 等 3D 感知模型** (如 `[keetha2025mapanythinguniversalfeedforwardmetric]`, `[wang2025vggt]`) | **评估工具**：前馈式模型，能够从单张或序列图像中预测稠密深度图和相机位姿，用于3D场景重建和度量理解。 | **角色不同**：这些模型在之前的工作中主要作为**感知或重建工具**独立使用。 | **工具的角色转变**：在 GrndCtrl 中，MapAnything 等模型被用作**冻结的奖励评估器**。它们不再是最终输出的组成部分，而是为强化学习提供**自我监督的、可验证的反馈信号**。这创造了一种新的“感知-生成”闭环，利用先进的3D感知能力来约束和提升生成模型的几何质量。 |\n\n### 总结：GrndCtrl 的核心创新与改进\n\n1.  **范式创新（RLWG）**：提出了 **“用可验证奖励进行世界模型接地”** 的全新后训练范式。这不同于之前任何专注于视觉质量或监督微调的方法，将语言模型对齐的成功经验创造性地引入具身AI领域。\n2.  **问题针对性**：直接瞄准了当前SOTA视频世界模型（如Cosmos）的**阿喀琉斯之踵**——**长时程几何不一致性**。通过实验证明，尤其是在**反事实（Counterfactual）** 和**未见（Unseen）** 场景下，GrndCtrl能大幅降低位姿误差和方差。\n3.  **技术整合与改进**：\n    *   **奖励设计**：精心设计了一套多目标、可验证的奖励函数（平移、旋转、深度重投影、视频质量），同时兼顾全局轨迹对齐和局部几何平滑。\n    *   **优化流程**：将GRPO算法适配于扩散模型的世界模型后训练，解决了在连续高维空间中进行策略优化的稳定性问题，并提出了针对扩散模型训练的内存和稳定性优化技巧（如部分时间步回传）。\n    *   **无需额外监督**：整个框架完全自监督，不依赖人工标注或外部仿真器，仅利用预训练的冻结评估器和模型自身的rollouts。\n\n**总而言之，GrndCtrl 不是对前作模型的简单修补，而是提出了一套系统的后训练方法论。它站在“强大的生成式预训练模型”和“强大的3D感知模型”两个巨人的肩膀上，通过强化学习将它们连接起来，从而赋予了生成模型以物理可验证的几何一致性，这是迈向可靠、可规划、可控制的具身世界模型的关键一步。**",

RLWG 框架** | **核心思想**：将预训练的视频世界模型 `W_θ` 视为一个策略，通过强化学习优化一组可验证的奖励，使其生成结果在几何和物理上更一致。<br>**数学形式化**：给定初始帧 `x_0` 和动作序列 `a_0:T-1`，模型采样生成视频序列 `x̂_1:T ~ W_θ(·|x_0, a_0:T-1)`。目标是优化参数 `θ` 以最大化奖励函数 `U(x̂_1:T)`。 | - **动作空间**：`a_t = (R_t, t_t)`，其中 `R_t ∈ SO(3)` 为旋转，`t_t ∈ ℝ³` 为平移。<br>- **核心创新**：不同于传统使用重建损失，RLWG 使用来自冻结评估器的**可验证奖励**作为优化目标。 |\n| **2. 可验证的自监督奖励** | 奖励由冻结的 3D 评估器 `ℰ` (如 MapAnything) 和视频评估器 `𝒱` (如 VideoAlign) 计算，无需人工标注。 | 评估器在训练中参数冻结，仅用于提供奖励信号。 |\n| **2.1 平移奖励 (r_trans)** | **计算原理**：衡量生成视频中估计的相机平移与给定动作指令之间的偏差。<br>**数学公式**：<br>1. 平移误差：`e_t^trans = Δt_t - t_t`，其中 `Δt_t` 为评估器估计的相对平移。<br>2. 奖励：`r_trans = -(1/|𝒯| Σ_{t∈𝒯} ‖e_t^trans‖₂² + ‖e_|𝒯|^trans‖₂²)`。<br>**推导**：奖励为负的均方误差与最终误差之和，最小化累积和最终的平移漂移。 | - `𝒯`：被评估的时间步集合。<br>- 当尺度模糊时，会使用评估器估计的尺度进行归一化。 |\n| **2.2 旋转奖励 (r_rot)** | **计算原理**：衡量生成视频中估计的相机旋转与给定动作指令之间的角度偏差。<br>**数学公式**：<br>1. 旋转误差（轴角）：`e_t^rot = arccos( (tr(ΔR_t · R_t^T) - 1) / 2 )`。<br>2. 奖励：`r_rot = - Σ_{t∈𝒯} e_t^rot`。<br>**推导**：`tr(ΔR_t · R_t^T)` 计算两个旋转矩阵乘积的迹，用于推导它们之间的角度差。奖励为负的累积角度误差。 | - `ΔR_t`：评估器估计的相对旋转矩阵。<br>- `R_t`：动作指令中的目标旋转矩阵。 |\n| **2.3 深度时序重投影奖励 (r_dtr)** | **计算原理**：衡量相邻帧之间基于深度的几何一致性，使用深度内点比率。<br>**数学公式**：<br>1. 重投影：对于像素 `p`，通过深度 `D_t` 和估计的位姿 `(ΔR_t, Δt_t)` 将其投影到帧 `t+1`，得到投影点 `p̂` 和期望深度 `d_{t→t+1}^exp(p)`。<br>2. 深度内点比率：`DTRI_t^(γ) = 1/|Ω| Σ_{p∈Ω} 1[ \\| D_{t+1}(p̂) - d_{t→t+1}^exp(p) \\| / d_{t→t+1}^exp(p) < γ ]`。<br>3. 奖励：`r_dtr = 1/|𝒯| Σ_{t∈𝒯} DTRI_t^(γ)`。<br>**推导**：该奖励鼓励生成的视频序列满足多视图几何约束，深度重投影误差小的像素比例越高越好。 | - `γ`：内点阈值，论文中设为 `0.0103`。<br>- `Φ(·)`：表示完整的重投影几何函数，涉及相机内参 `K_t`, `K_{t+1}`。 |\n| **2.4 视频质量奖励 (r_v)** | **计算原理**：确保后训练不损害视觉保真度，使用冻结视频评估器打分。<br>**数学公式**：<br>1. 评估器输出：`(s_vis, s_mot, s_txt) = 𝒱(x̂_1:T; y)`。<br>2. 奖励：`r_v = α s_vis + β s_mot`，其中 `α, β ≥ 0`, `α+β=1`。<br>**推导**：将视觉质量 (`s_vis`) 和运动质量 (`s_mot`) 线性组合，文本对齐分数 `s_txt` 在非文本条件下被忽略。 | - 默认参数：`α = β = 0.5`。<br>- 评估器 `𝒱` 为 VideoAlign。 |\n| **3. GrndCtrl 训练算法 (基于 GRPO)** | **核心思想**：采用分组相对策略优化来高效优化上述多目标奖励。对每个上下文 `c`，模型生成一组 `G` 个随机 rollout，在组内计算相对优势进行更新。<br>**数学原理**：<br>1. **分组采样**：从模型采样 `G` 个候选序列 `{x̂_(1:T)^(i)}_(i=1)^G`。通过控制扩散模型采样过程中的随机性 (`η` 参数) 来获得多样性。<br>2. **奖励归一化与优势计算**：对每个奖励 `r`，在组内进行标准化：`r̃^(i) = (r^(i) - mean(r)) / std(r)`。然后计算优势：`A_i = (r̃^(i) - mean(r̃)) / std(r̃)`。这本质上是**组内的二次标准化**，使得优化关注于组内相对排名。<br>3. **策略优化目标**：使用近端策略优化风格的裁剪目标函数：<br>`J(θ) = E[ 1/G Σ_{i=1}^G 1/T Σ_{t=1}^T min( ρ_{t,i} A_i, clip(ρ_{t,i}, 1-ϵ, 1+ϵ) A_i ) ]`<br>其中 `ρ_{t,i} = π_θ(a_t^(i)|s_t^(i)) / π_ref(a_t^(i)|s_t^(i))` 为重要性采样比率，`π_ref` 为参考策略（旧模型）。<br>**扩散模型采样随机性控制**：<br>论文通过调节反向 SDE 中的随机噪声来产生组内多样性。具体使用方差保持型 SDE：<br>前向 SDE: `dx_t = -1/2 β(t) x_t dt + sqrt(β(t)) dw_t`<br>反向 SDE: `dx_t = [-1/2 β(t) x_t - β(t) ∇_x log p_t(x_t)] dt + sqrt(β(t)) d w̄_t`<br>通过控制参数 `η ∈ [0,1]` 来混合确定性 ODE (`η=0`) 和完全随机 SDE (`η=1`) 的采样行为。 | - **关键参数**：组大小 `G = 8`；裁剪范围 `ϵ` (文中未明确给出，通常为 0.2)；扩散总步数 35，但**仅反向传播前 60% 的步数**（即 21 步）以稳定训练。<br>- **正则化**：目标函数隐含了通过参考策略 (`π_ref`) 进行的 KL 散度正则化，防止偏离预训练模型太远。<br>- **采样**：使用 `η=1` 进行完全随机的反向 SDE 采样以获得组内多样性。 |\n| **4. 反事实动作生成** | **技术细节**：用于构建“反事实”评估场景，测试模型对非常规动作的几何泛化能力。<br>**数学原理**：对给定的 6-DoF 动作 `(x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw)` 进行左右镜像，得到反事实动作：`(-x, y, z, roll, -pitch, -yaw)`。<br>**推导**：假设相机坐标系为 X右、Y下、Z前。镜像",

            "answer": "## 论文主要局限性分析\n\n基于对论文内容的分析，其提出的 **GrndCtrl** 方法和 **RLWG** 框架存在以下主要局限性：\n\n### 1. 实验规模与范围有限\n- **数据集与预算**：实验在中等规模的数据集（CODa, SCAND, CityWalk）和有限的计算预算下进行。虽然证明了核心原理的有效性，但尚未在大规模、多样化的数据集上进行验证。\n- **泛化性验证**：尽管在“未见”场景中展示了泛化能力，但测试场景仍局限于类似的户外导航环境，未涵盖更复杂的室内、动态对象交互或跨领域任务。\n\n### 2. 训练稳定性与方差依赖\n- **对奖励方差的强依赖**：**GrndCtrl** 的训练稳定性严重依赖于**组内多个随机展开（rollout）之间产生足够的奖励方差**。如果所有展开的质量都过于相似（都好或都差），优势归一化步骤会放大细微差异，导致训练不稳定甚至崩溃（产生噪声）。\n- **检查点选择敏感**：需要精心选择预训练模型的检查点，确保其能产生可区分好坏质量的展开，这对实际应用增加了复杂性。\n\n### 3. 奖励设计与优化策略\n- **固定权重策略**：论文使用了固定的多目标奖励组合（平移、旋转、深度重投影、视频质量），但**未探索自适应的奖励权重策略**。不同的任务或场景可能需要在全局对齐、局部一致性和视觉保真度之间进行不同的权衡。\n- **潜在的奖励黑客（Reward Hacking）风险**：由于使用了黑盒评估器（如 MapAnything, VideoAlign），模型可能学会“欺骗”评估器以提高奖励分数，而并未真正改善物理一致性。论文提到偶尔观察到此类行为，需要通过重新训练来缓解。\n\n### 4. 计算与内存开销\n- **高昂的内存需求**：GRPO后训练需要为每个上下文生成多个完整的视频展开，并保持所有扩散步骤的计算图以计算每步似然比，这比监督微调（SFT）**内存密集得多**。\n- **效率限制**：为了适应内存，训练批量大小较小（每GPU为1），并通过增加每组展开数量（G=8）来补偿，这可能影响训练效率和收敛速度。\n\n### 5. 视觉质量与噪声权衡\n- **缺乏像素级监督**：RLWG框架仅依赖奖励信号，没有像素级重建损失。这可能导致展开中的**视觉噪声逐渐增加**。虽然使用了KL正则化向预训练模型对齐来缓解，但过度的后训练迭代仍可能导致噪声累积，甚至超出评估器的容错范围，导致奖励失效和模型崩溃。\n\n### 6. 评估器依赖与潜在偏差\n- **对冻结评估器的依赖**：整个奖励计算依赖于外部冻结的评估器（如MapAnything用于几何，VideoAlign用于质量）。这些评估器自身的**性能上限、偏差或故障会直接传导给世界模型的训练**。例如，如果评估器在特定场景（如鱼眼图像、极端光照）下失效，奖励信号将不可靠。\n- **动作空间限制**：论文中模型使用6-DOF动作空间，而一些相关工作（如NWM）使用3-DOF。这种差异使得与某些基线模型的直接公平比较变得困难。\n\n---\n\n## 未来可能的改进方向\n\n针对上述局限性，论文在“Limitations”和“Appendix”部分暗示或可推导出以下未来研究方向：\n\n### 1. 扩展规模与泛化性研究\n- **大规模训练**：在更大、更多样化的视频数据集上进行训练，验证RLWG框架在更广泛场景（室内、操纵、驾驶）下的可扩展性和泛化能力。\n- **复杂任务测试**：将框架应用于需要更高层次物理理解和交互的闭环任务，如长期规划、避障、与动态环境交互。\n\n### 2. 提升训练稳定性与算法鲁棒性\n- **方差动态研究**：深入理论研究世界模型展开中奖励方差的动态特性，设计更稳定的优势估计方法或替代优化策略，减少对高方差的依赖。\n- **自适应课程学习**：开发自适应的训练课程，动态调整难度或奖励组合，以平稳引导模型学习物理一致性，避免训练崩溃。\n\n### 3. 优化奖励机制与多目标权衡\n- **自适应奖励加权**：研究**原则性的多奖励加权方案**（如基于帕累托最优、不确定性或任务优先级），动态调整不同奖励项的重要性。\n- **设计更全面的物理奖励**：引入更多可验证的物理约束作为奖励，如**物体持久性、碰撞避免、刚体运动一致性**等，以增强世界模型的基础物理理解。\n\n### 4. 降低计算成本与提升效率\n- **高效的似然比计算**：开发更高效的方法来估计或近似扩散模型中的策略梯度，减少需要回传梯度的扩散步数，降低内存开销。\n- **分布式与异步训练**：探索更先进的分布式训练策略，以支持更大批量和更多并行展开，加速训练过程。\n\n### 5. 缓解视觉退化与提升保真度\n- **混合目标函数**：在RLWG目标中**谨慎地引入像素级或特征级重建损失**作为正则化项，在提升几何一致性的同时，更好地保持视觉保真度。\n- **感知质量奖励的细化**：使用更细粒度的感知评估器，或设计针对世界模型展开特性的专用质量评估指标。\n\n### 6. 减少对外部评估器的依赖\n- **自监督评估器学习**：探索**联合训练或在线适应评估器**的可能性，使其与世界模型共同进化，减少预训练评估器的偏差影响。\n- **内在一致性奖励**：设计更多基于模型内部状态或特征的**自洽性奖励**，减少对外部黑盒模型的依赖。\n\n### 7. 框架通用化与理论深化\n- **框架通用性验证**：将RLWG框架应用于**其他类型的世界模型架构**（如基于Transformer的预测模型、流匹配模型），验证其普适性。\n- **理论分析**：对RLWG框架的收敛性、最优解特性以及与经典强化学习、模型基础理论之间的联系进行更深入的理论分析。\n\n**总结**：GrndCtrl 和 RLWG 为 grounding 视觉世界模型提供了一个创新且有效的自监督后训练范式。未来的工作将围绕**扩展规模、提升稳定性、优化奖励设计、降低计算成本以及深化理论理解**展开，旨在构建出更强大、更可靠、更通用的物理 grounded 世界模型，为具身智能提供更坚实的仿真基础。",
