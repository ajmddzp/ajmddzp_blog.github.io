Their remarkable capabilities enable generalist robot policy learning, policy evaluation, and visual planning that is well-aligned with commonsense knowledge.\n1\nIntroduction\nRecent breakthroughs in generative modeling, such as diffusion and flow-matching\n[\n1\n,\n2\n]\n, have enabled high-fidelity controllable video synthesis conditioned on user inputs such as text prompts, robot actions, and video frames. By training on internet-scale data, state-of-the-art (SOTA) video models learn to create rich videos that capture aesthetic and dynamic (motion) effects (e.g., with cinematic lighting, camera motion, and physical interaction between agents), driving widespread applications in video editing and content creation\n[\n3\n,\n4\n,\n5\n,\n6\n,\n7\n,\n8\n,\n9\n,\n10\n,\n11\n]\n.\nAs a result, these models have been increasingly integrated into robotics, e.g., in robot data generation, visual planning, policy learning, and policy evaluation\n[\n12\n,\n13\n,\n14\n,\n15\n,\n16\n,\n17\n]\n, drawing upon their impressive zero-shot generalization capabilities\n[\n18\n]\n.\nIn this survey, we provide a review of video models, highlighting their capabilities, applications in robotics, and limitations.\nThe advent of large vision-language models (VLMs/LLMs)\n[\n19\n,\n20\n,\n21\n]\nhas significantly transformed the state of the art in many problem domains (e.g., natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, etc.) due to their remarkable language generation and commonsense reasoning capabilities. Through pretraining on internet-scale data, LLMs learn broad foundational knowledge required to solve a wide range of tasks, which has resulted in their emergence as impressive zero-shot AI models. For example, VLMs function as the backbones of SOTA vision-language-action robot policies\n[\n22\n,\n23\n,\n24\n]\n, which enable robots to perform diverse tasks with a single (unified) policy in place of multiple task-specific policies.\nDespite these impressive capabilities, language models face some important limitations. First, language-only abstractions lack the expressiveness required to efficiently capture the intricate interaction processes inherent in the physical world. For example, consider the task of creating a concise fine-grained description of the contact interactions between a robot’s gripper and a target deformable object, e.g., a cloth. Such a task is immensely challenging due to the high density of information and the limited capacity of language.\nSecond, language-centric modeling fails to accurately model the spatial and temporal dependencies between real-world phenomena (events) that are crucial to comprehensively understanding the physical world.\nAlthough physics-based simulators offer visual world modeling capabilities, their practical effectiveness is limited by a number of fundamental challenges. Particularly, physics-based simulation generally requires restrictive simplifying assumptions that hinder the visual and physical fidelity of their predictions. For example, physics engines require expensive asset curation procedures to minimize the sim-to-real gap and struggle to accurately simulate deformable bodies with complex morphology and dynamics.\nVideo generation models address these aforementioned limitations by providing a photorealistic, physically consistent spatiotemporal model of the world. These capabilities have driven growing applications of video models in robotics.\nIn robotics, video models have been increasingly adopted as embodied world models\n[\n25\n,\n26\n,\n27\n,\n28\n]\n.\nHigh-fidelity\nworld modeling establishes a trustworthy foundation for efficient evaluation of robot policies\n[\n17\n,\n29\n,\n16\n,\n30\n]\n.\nPolicy evaluation\nhas traditionally necessitated setting up real-world robot stations for online policy roll-outs, which is notably expensive given the pertinent hardware and labor cost. Video models circumvent this bottleneck without compromising the reliability of evaluation results.\nAs high-fidelity world models, video models also provide accurate dynamics and rewards predictions, which is essential in training robot policies using reinforcement learning\n[\n31\n,\n32\n,\n33\n,\n34\n]\n.\nAdditionally, video models enable\ncost-effective robot data generation\n, which is particularly important in imitation learning. While data scaling has proven to be a critical recipe for advancing the performance of SOTA robot policies\n[\n35\n,\n23\n]\n, collecting expert demonstration data is incredibly expensive, posing a significant limitation. Video models facilitate scalable data generation without relying on human supervision, addressing this pressing challenge.\nThe expert demonstrations from video models can also be\ndirectly applied to a robot through motion retargeting\n[\n36\n,\n37\n,\n38\n]\n.\nBeyond generating successful task demonstrations, video models can also synthesize failure video trajectories that endow robot policies with corrective behaviors for more robustness.\nFurthermore, the generated data can be optimized through\nvisual planning\nto compute more optimal robot trajectories\n[\n39\n,\n15\n,\n40\n,\n14\n,\n41\n,\n42\n]\n.\nAlthough video models provide valuable capabilities, their integration into robotics faces notable limitations. Like LLMs, video models tend to hallucinate, generating videos that are physically unrealistic, e.g., with objects appearing/disappearing or deforming in ways that violate physics\n[\n43\n,\n44\n,\n45\n,\n46\n]\n. Video models also struggle to follow user instructions\n[\n47\n,\n48\n]\n, especially in long-duration video generation tasks\n[\n49\n,\n50\n,\n51\n]\n. Further, significant data curation, training, and inference costs and the lack of adequate content safeguards in video generation remain critical challenges\n[\n52\n,\n53\n]\n, hindering broader adoption in robotics.\nThis survey provides an extensive overview of video models, identifying prevailing model architectures, key applications in robotics, and major challenges. We highlight four prominent applications of video models as embodied world models in robotics, including: (i) robot data generation and action prediction in imitation learning, (ii) dynamics and rewards modeling in reinforcement learning, (iii) policy evaluation, and (iv) visual planning, as illustrated in\nFigure\n1\n. Furthermore, we outline important open research challenges impeding trustworthy applications of video models in robotics and present important directions for future research to address these problems.\nComparison to Existing Surveys.\nPrior survey papers have covered video generation models broadly, particularly video diffusion models, identifying the prevailing model architectures\n[\n54\n,\n55\n]\n, techniques for controllable video generation\n[\n56\n]\n, core applications in video generation, video editing, and video understanding\n[\n57\n]\n. Other surveys\n[\n58\n,\n59\n,\n60\n,\n61\n]\nprovide a broad discussion of world models, presenting a valuable review of research across a wide range of model architectures, such as recurrent neural networks, transformers, language models, and scene reconstruction models, e.g., Gaussian Splatting.\nPrior work also highlights the unified framework for information representation and task formulation provided by video models\n[\n62\n]\nand discuss the progression in the capabilities of video models, through a primarily historical lens, along with potential future capabilities\n[\n63\n]\n.\nAlthough relevant for broader understanding, these existing surveys lack a comprehensive review of generative video models as world models in robotics\n[\n58\n,\n59\n,\n60\n,\n61\n]\nor an extensive discussion of specific applications, associated challenges, and future directions of generative video models in robotics\n[\n54\n,\n55\n,\n56\n,\n57\n,\n63\n]\n.\nIn contrast, our survey provides an exhaustive discussion of video generation models in robotics, especially in robot manipulation, which has not been considered by existing surveys unlike areas such as autonomous driving\n[\n64\n,\n65\n,\n66\n,\n67\n]\n.\nOrganization.\nWe discuss the organization of this survey, as summarized in\nFigure\n2\n.\nIn\nSection\n2\n, we provide an overview of important concepts that are crucial to understanding generative video modeling. We begin with a discussion of learned world models, highlighting the evolution of these models from (latent) state-based representations to high-fidelity video-based representations. Further, we review diffusion/flow-matching-based modeling highlighting the core principles behind their success. In\nSection\n3\n, we present major applications of video models in robotics, encompassing robot data generation and action prediction in imitation learning, dynamics and rewards modeling in reinforcement learning, policy evaluation, and visual planning. In\nSection\n4\n, we highlight useful metrics and benchmarks for evaluating video models. Subsequently, we identify open research challenges in\nSection\n5\nand suggest directions for future research. We conclude the survey in\nSection\n6\n.\n2\nBackground\nIn this section, we provide relevant background concepts that are essential to understanding the material presented in this survey. We begin with a brief introduction of world models, followed by an overview of video models. Specifically, we categorize video models broadly into non-diffusion-based video models and diffusion/flow-matching-based video models.

For example, reinforcement learning (RL) methods\n[\n139\n,\n140\n]\ngenerally require a large number of interactions between an agent and its environment to learn useful behaviors, which is typically expensive in the real-world. World models enable scalable data collection for training these policies with little to no real-world interaction.\nAt their core, world models predict the evolution of the environment of an agent due to interactions.\nTraditionally, physics-based simulators\n[\n141\n,\n142\n]\nhave been utilized as world models for predicting the dynamical effects of a robot’s actions.\nHowever, physics-based simulators typically utilize simplified physics engines that approximate physical laws for computational feasibility, introducing inductive biases that limit their realism, e.g., in simulating non-rigid objects. Importantly, these approximations often contribute to the sim-to-real gap in robotics, impeding successful transfer of simulation-trained robot policies to the real-world. Moreover, robot manipulation tasks have become increasingly complex, exacerbating these challenges.\nLearned world models\n[\n143\n,\n144\n]\nhave emerged as an effective solution to these challenges.\nWe can broadly classify learned world models into two categories:\nMarkovian state-based\nworld models and\nvideo\nworld models.\nMarkovian State-Based World Models.\nA state refers to a description of the environment of an agent at a given time step, which could include its RGB observations, proprioception, or latent embeddings of these observations at past and current time steps. Markovian state-based world models assume that the future evolution of the agent’s environment only depends on the agent’s state\ns\nt\ns_{t}\nat the current time step\nt\nt\nand its action\na\nt\na_{t}\n, which represents either a physical action or a latent action.\nMarkovian state-based world models are trained to predict the future state\ns\nt\n+\n1\ns_{t+1}\n, given the current state\ns\nt\ns_{t}\nand action\na\nt\na_{t}\n:\ns\nt\n+\n1\n∼\np\nη\n​\n(\ns\nt\n+\n1\n|\ns\nt\n,\na\nt\n)\n,\ns_{t+1}\\sim p_{\\eta}(s_{t+1}|s_{t},a_{t}),\n(1)\nwhere\np\nη\np_{\\eta}\nrepresents the dynamics predictor with parameters\nη\n\\eta\n.\nThese world models generally operate in latent space and are composed of an encoder for embedding observations into a latent space, dynamics predictor, and rewards predictor, given by:\nEncoder:\ns\nt\n∼\nℰ\nγ\n​\n(\ns\nt\n|\no\nt\n)\n,\n\\displaystyle s_{t}\\sim\\mathcal{E}_{\\gamma}(s_{t}|o_{t}),\n(2)\nDynamics Predictor:\ns\n^\nt\n+\n1\n∼\np\nη\n​\n(\ns\n^\nt\n+\n1\n|\ns\nt\n,\na\nt\n)\n,\n\\displaystyle\\hat{s}_{t+1}\\sim p_{\\eta}(\\hat{s}_{t+1}|s_{t},a_{t}),\n(3)\nRewards Predictor:\nr\n^\nt\n+\n1\n∼\np\nζ\n​\n(\nr\n^\nt\n+\n1\n|\ns\n^\nt\n+\n1\n)\n,\n\\displaystyle\\hat{r}_{t+1}\\sim p_{\\zeta}(\\hat{r}_{t+1}|\\hat{s}_{t+1}),\n(4)\nwith parameters\nγ\n\\gamma\nand\nζ\n\\zeta\nfor the encoder and rewards predictor, respectively.\nPrior work\n[\n145\n,\n146\n,\n68\n,\n69\n,\n147\n,\n148\n]\nhas largely parameterized the dynamics predictor\np\nη\np_{\\eta}\nusing recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or recurrent state-space models (RSSMs).\nHowever, more recent works employ transformers\n[\n70\n]\nand diffusion in pixel space\n[\n149\n,\n150\n,\n151\n]\nor latent space\n[\n152\n,\n153\n]\nfor more expressive dynamics prediction.\nIn general, world models\n[\n74\n,\n75\n,\n154\n,\n155\n,\n70\n,\n156\n,\n88\n]\nare trained to minimize the error between the predicted and ground-truth next state, either in latent space or reconstructed pixel space using the mean-squared error (MSE) loss function\n[\n70\n,\n149\n]\nor the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss\n[\n68\n]\n.\nWe refer interested readers to\n[\n58\n]\nfor a detailed review of Markovian state-based world models.\nVideo World Models.\nTo model the world, video models learn spatiotemporal mappings that capture the evolution of an environment over space and time, without explicitly modeling a Markovian state, in contrast to Markovian state-based world models.\nIn general, video models apply non-linear transformations to the patches or pixels of a video frame to propagate the environment dynamics.\nEarly research in video prediction applied spatial transformations to pixels to generate future frames\n[\n157\n,\n158\n]\n. However, these transformations capture only local perturbations of the frames, limiting their expressiveness in more complex video generation tasks, e.g., with dynamic backgrounds.\nOther methods\n[\n71\n,\n159\n]\nextend generative adversarial networks (GANs)\n[\n160\n]\nto the video prediction setting, demonstrating higher-fidelity video generation. However, the susceptibility of GANs to mode collapse limits their ability to model diverse potential video evolution paths.\nSubsequent work\n[\n72\n,\n161\n,\n162\n,\n163\n,\n73\n]\nuses variational inference via variational autoencoders\n[\n164\n]\nto learn a latent distribution over pixels, explicitly encoding the stochasticity in video prediction within the latent distribution. Some of these methods\n[\n72\n]\nutilize a convolutional decoder to map back to the RGB space, while others\n[\n161\n,\n163\n]\napply GANs and long-short term memory networks\n[\n165\n]\nfor decoding the sampled latent variables.\nGiven the success of transformers in language modeling, the work in\n[\n166\n]\nintroduces the video transformer, achieving higher-quality video generation through autoregressive predictions.\nHowever, powerful autoregressive decoders introduce the challenge of latent collapse, where the learned model fails to efficiently use the latent space. Vector-quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAEs)\n[\n167\n]\naddress this issue by quantizing the latent representations into discrete codes in a codebook.\nVQ-VAEs are typically pre-trained on large-scale image and video datasets with a reconstruction objective and typically utilize spatial and temporal compression for compact latent embeddings across frames. To enforce temporal causality, VQ-VAEs replace GroupNorm operations with RMSNorm operations for temporal feature caching\n[\n10\n,\n11\n]\n.\nBuilding on these advances, later research efforts use VQ-VAEs to learn the latent distribution with autoregressive convolutional decoders\n[\n162\n]\nor autoregressive transformers\n[\n73\n,\n168\n]\nfor higher-fidelity video generation. Further, Genie\n[\n28\n]\ntrains a controllable video model using a VQ-VAE and a latent action model for frame-by-frame control.\nDespite the resulting performance gains, these video models lack the ability to capture complex interactions within an environment, limiting their applications.\nThese limitations have been addressed by diffusion and flow-based matching, enabling video models to learn highly expressive representations of the physical world.\nWe provide a detailed discussion of these video models in the subsequent subsections, along with a brief overview of joint-embedding predictive architectures, which seek to learn world models from video data without predicting pixel-level visual details.\n2.2\nDiffusion/Flow-Matching Video Models\nFigure 3:\nDiffusion Video Model Architectures.\nDiffusion/Flow-matching has emerged as the dominant model architecture for training photorealistic controllable video models that can be steered using text, image, and other conditioning inputs. These models broadly utilize diffusion transformers (DiTs) or U-Nets to learn important interpendencies across space and time within a compact latent space.\nThe emergence of diffusion modeling\n[\n1\n]\nand flow-matching\n[\n2\n]\nhas transformed the SOTA in image and video generation\n[\n169\n,\n170\n]\n, achieving high-fidelity video generation that capture fine-grained realistic and cinematic effects.\nGiven the similarity between diffusion modeling and flow-matching, we limit our discussion to diffusion models for simplicity.\nWe refer readers to\n[\n2\n]\nfor a more detailed presentation of flow-matching.\nDiffusion models\n[\n1\n]\nhave gained prominence as a powerful formulation for generative models that synthesize data by modeling an iterative denoising process. We review the mathematical formulation of diffusion models, common architectural designs, and their supported input/output modalities, which is summarized in\nFigure\n3\n.\n2.2.1\nMathematical Formulation\nDiffusion models\n[\n1\n,\n171\n]\nlearn a generative process by reversing a gradual noising process that transforms data into pure noise. Instead of directly modeling the likelihood function, diffusion models learn the gradient of the log-probability density, enabling them to effectively guide any sample\n𝐱\n\\mathbf{x}\nto the desired data manifold, without explicitly parameterizing the data distribution.\nFormally, given data\n𝐱\n0\n∼\nq\n​\n(\n𝐱\n0\n)\n\\mathbf{x}_{0}\\sim q(\\mathbf{x}_{0})\n, the\nforward process\n(also called the diffusion process) progressively corrupts clean data\n𝐱\n0\n\\mathbf{x}_{0}\nwith Gaussian noise over\nT\nT\ntime steps under some noise schedule\n{\nβ\nt\n}\nt\n=\n1\nT\n\\{\\beta_{t}\\}_{t=1}^{T}\n, given by:\nq\n​\n(\n𝐱\nt\n|\n𝐱\nt\n−\n1\n)\n=\n𝒩\n​\n(\n𝐱\nt\n;\n1\n−\nβ\nt\n​\n𝐱\nt\n−\n1\n,\nβ\nt\n​\n𝐈\n)\n.\nq(\\mathbf{x}_{t}|\\mathbf{x}_{t-1})=\\mathcal{N}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{t};\\sqrt{1-\\beta_{t}}\\,\\mathbf{x}_{t-1},\\,\\beta_{t}\\mathbf{I}\\right).\n(5)\nThe forward diffusion process can be expressed in closed form as the marginal distribution over noisy samples at any time step\nt\nt\n[\n172\n]\n:\nq\n​\n(\n𝐱\nt\n|\n𝐱\n0\n)\n=\n𝒩\n​\n(\n𝐱\nt\n;\nα\n¯\nt\n​\n𝐱\n0\n,\n(\n1\n−\nα\n¯\nt\n)\n​\n𝐈\n)\n,\nq(\\mathbf{x}_{t}|\\mathbf{x}_{0})=\\mathcal{N}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{t};\\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_{t}}\\mathbf{x}_{0},\\,(1-\\bar{\\alpha}_{t})\\mathbf{I}\\right),\n(6)\nwhere\nα\nt\n=\n1\n−\nβ\nt\n{\\alpha_{t}=1-\\beta_{t}}\nand\nα\nt\n¯\n=\nΠ\ni\n=\n0\nα\nt\n{\\bar{\\alpha_{t}}=\\Pi_{i=0}^{\\alpha_{t}}}\n.\nIn contrast, the\nreverse process\niteratively removes the noise added to the images in the forward process.\nMore specifically, each denoising step is parameterized by a Gaussian transition\np\nθ\n​\n(\n𝐱\nt\n−\n1\n|\n𝐱\nt\n)\np_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{x}_{t-1}|\\mathbf{x}_{t})\nwith learnable weights\nθ\n\\theta\nthat approximates the true posterior\nq\n​\n(\n𝐱\nt\n−\n1\n|\n𝐱\nt\n,\n𝐱\n0\n)\nq(\\mathbf{x}_{t-1}|\\mathbf{x}_{t},\\mathbf{x}_{0})\n:\np\nθ\n​\n(\n𝐱\nt\n−\n1\n|\n𝐱\nt\n)\n=\n𝒩\n​\n(\n𝐱\nt\n−\n1\n;\nμ\nθ\n​\n(\n𝐱\nt\n,\nt\n)\n,\n𝚺\nθ\n​\n(\n𝐱\nt\n,\nt\n)\n)\n.\np_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{x}_{t-1}|\\mathbf{x}_{t})=\\mathcal{N}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{t-1};\\mathbf{\\mu}_{\\theta}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{t},t\\right),\\mathbf{\\Sigma}_{\\theta}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{t},t\\right)\\right).\n(7)\nDiffusion models are trained to minimize the divergence between the distribution of the forward and backward transitions by predicting the ground-truth noise\nϵ\n\\bm{\\epsilon}\nwith the (simplified) loss function\n[\n1\n]\n:\nL\nϵ\n=\n𝔼\n𝐱\n0\n,\nt\n,\nϵ\n​\n[\n‖\nϵ\n−\nϵ\nθ\n​\n(\n𝐱\nt\n,\nt\n)\n‖\n2\n]\n.\nL_{\\bm{\\epsilon}}=\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{x}_{0},t,\\bm{\\epsilon}}\\left[\\left\\|\\bm{\\epsilon}-\\bm{\\epsilon}_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{x}_{t},t)\\right\\|^{2}\\right].\n(8)\nAlternatively, the loss function can be expressed using a velocity-based parameterization\n[\n173\n]\nfor better numerical stability and faster convergence, where the model is trained to predict the velocity\n𝒗\n=\nα\n¯\nt\n​\nϵ\n−\n1\n−\nα\n¯\nt\n​\n𝐱\n0\n{\\bm{v}=\\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_{t}}\\bm{\\epsilon}-\\sqrt{1-\\bar{\\alpha}_{t}}\\mathbf{x}_{0}}\n, with the loss function:\nL\n𝒗\n=\n𝔼\n𝐱\n0\n,\nt\n,\n𝒗\nt\n​\n[\n‖\n𝒗\nt\n−\n𝒗\nθ\n​\n(\n𝐱\nt\n,\nt\n)\n‖\n2\n]\n.\nL_{\\bm{v}}=\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{x}_{0},t,\\bm{v}_{t}}\\left[\\left\\|\\bm{v}_{t}-\\bm{v}_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{x}_{t},t)\\right\\|^{2}\\right].\n(9)\nTo enable controllability of diffusion models, the loss function is modified for conditioning using input prompts or actions, which we discuss next.\n2.2.2\nClassifier-Based and Classifier-Free Guidance\nConditioning for diffusion models is used to steer the outputs of diffusion models towards desired attributes specified by an input prompt through classifier-based and classifier-free guidance. Classifier-based guidance\n[\n169\n]\ntrains an external classifier that learns to predict an attribute (label)\ny\ny\nfrom a noisy sample\nx\nt\nx_{t}\n, denoted as\np\nϕ\n​\n(\ny\n∣\nx\nt\n)\np_{\\phi}(y\\mid x_{t})\n. At inference time, the model can be steered towards a desired attribute by biasing the sampled noise towards the direction that increases the likelihood of that attribute via:\nϵ\n^\nθ\n​\n(\nx\nt\n,\nt\n,\ny\n)\n=\nϵ\nθ\n​\n(\nx\nt\n,\nt\n)\n−\ns\n⋅\nσ\nt\n​\n∇\nx\nt\nlog\n⁡\np\nϕ\n​\n(\ny\n∣\nx\nt\n)\n,\n\\hat{\\epsilon}_{\\theta}(x_{t},t,y)=\\epsilon_{\\theta}(x_{t},t)-s\\cdot\\sigma_{t}\\nabla_{x_{t}}\\log p_{\\phi}(y\\mid x_{t}),\n(10)\nwhere\nϵ\n^\nθ\n\\hat{\\epsilon}_{\\theta}\ndenotes the biased noise sample.\nClassifier-based guidance is limited by high computation costs and training instability since it requires training a classifier on noisy data. Classifier-free guidance\n[\n174\n]\naddresses these challenges by training a joint conditional and unconditional model.\nAt inference time, the strength of the conditioning can be modulated by adjusting the guidance scale\nω\n\\omega\n:\nϵ\n~\nθ\n​\n(\nx\nt\n,\nt\n,\ny\n)\n=\n(\n1\n+\nw\n)\n​\nϵ\nθ\n​\n(\nx\nt\n,\nt\n,\ny\n)\n−\nw\n​\nϵ\nθ\n​\n(\nx\nt\n,\nt\n)\n.\n\\tilde{\\epsilon}_{\\theta}(x_{t},t,y)=(1+w)\\,\\epsilon_{\\theta}(x_{t},t,y)-w\\,\\epsilon_{\\theta}(x_{t},t).\n(11)\nwhere\nϵ\n~\nθ\n\\tilde{\\epsilon}_{\\theta}\ndenotes the biased noise sample.\nClassifier-free guidance has become the dominant conditioning strategy due to its simplicity, versatility, and robustness\n[\n175\n,\n176\n,\n177\n,\n178\n]\n.\n2.2.3\nModel Architecture\nEarly diffusion models\n[\n80\n]\noperate directly in the pixel space, which is prohibitively expensive at high resolutions. To overcome this limitation, recent approaches adopt a latent diffusion paradigm, where observations are first compressed into a lower-dimensional latent space using a variational autoencoder (VAE)\n[\n179\n,\n81\n,\n180\n,\n10\n,\n11\n]\nprior to the diffusion process.\nOther alternative latent representations can also be used, e.g., DINO features\n[\n181\n]\n.\nDiffusion models are broadly parameterized using U-Nets\n[\n182\n,\n183\n]\nor transformers\n[\n184\n,\n185\n]\n, which we discuss in the rest of this section.\nU-Net Architectures.\nThe U-Net architecture\n[\n182\n,\n183\n]\nhas become a foundational backbone for a wide range of vision tasks, including diffusion modeling. U-Nets consist of a downsampling path that progressively reduces the spatial resolution of an input image (video frame) with hierarchical convolution layers to capture high-level semantic features, followed by an upsampling path that recovers the original resolution of the input data. U-Nets rely on skip connections between corresponding layers in the encoder and decoder to preserve fine-grained spatial information and to stabilize training.\nBuilding on its success in image generation, early works on video diffusion\n[\n80\n,\n186\n,\n135\n]\nextend 2D U-Nets to the spatiotemporal domain by lifting 2D convolutions to 3D or by introducing temporal attention modules to jointly model spatial and temporal dependencies.\nTo create a unified strategy for training (U-Net) video diffusion models, Stable Video Diffusion\n[\n81\n]\nexplored effective strategies for data curation, text-to-image pretraining, video pretraining, and video model finetuning, demonstrating the superior performance of the resulting video models.\nThe resulting training recipe has been widely adopted by open-source video model implementations.\nTransformers.\nRecent work has utilized transformers in video diffusion modeling, given their effectiveness in language and computer vision tasks, e.g., language generation and object segmentation.\nTransformer-based diffusion models\n[\n184\n,\n185\n]\nreplace the traditional U-Net backbone with a diffusion transformers (DiT), leveraging the\nexpressivity of self-attention mechanisms.\nIn DiTs, visual inputs are first partitioned into patches and then embedded as tokens with positional encodings to preserve spatial relationships. Unlike U-Nets, which rely on an encoder–decoder hierarchy with skip connections to fuse multi-scale features, DiTs employ a uniform transformer architecture that jointly processes all tokens. This design trades the U-Net’s inductive biases toward locality and translation equivariance for a more flexible capacity to model long-range dependencies and higher-order semantic relationships.\nFor video generation tasks, these key characteristics enable DiTs to better capture temporal coherence and overall scene consistency, making them particularly effective for large-scale video diffusion models.\nConsequently, SOTA video models\n[\n185\n,\n10\n,\n5\n,\n7\n,\n9\n]\nutilize DiT-based architectures.\nMany methods employ specialized video encoders to perform temporal compression, substantially reducing token counts and thereby improving overall generation efficiency.\n2.2.4\nConditioning Modalities\nModern video diffusion models support a wide range of generation modalities for different levels of granularity in controllable video generation.\nBefore discussing specific conditioning modalities in video diffusion models, we first clarify the primary mechanisms by which conditioning signals are applied to the diffusion process.\nVideo diffusion models generally introduce conditioning inputs into the video generation process through channel concatenation, cross-attention, or adaptive normalization.\nChannel concatenation augments the inputs or latent representations along the channel dimension, which is most effective when the conditioning signal is spatially aligned with the target output, such as in image-to-video generation, depth guidance, or pose conditioning. This approach enforces a strong, pixel-wise correspondence and imposes a hard structural constraint on the generation process. In contrast, cross-attention captures interactions between intermediate video features (queries) and the conditioning signal (keys and values)\n[\n187\n]\n, making it the dominant approach for semantic, non-spatial conditions like text prompts. Finally, adaptive normalization methods such as AdaLN or FiLM\n[\n188\n,\n189\n]\nmodulate the scale and shift parameters of normalization layers using a global conditioning vector and are typically employed in (scalar) global attribute control, such as target frame rate or motion intensity, that affect overall generation statistics rather than localized structure.\nThe primary conditioning modalities supported by video diffusion models include text prompts, input images, and motion or trajectory primitives, described in the subsequent discussion.\nText-to-Video (T2V) Generation.\nText-to-Video (T2V) generation requires translating high-level semantic descriptions into temporally coherent visual sequences. To achieve this, conditioning is most commonly injected through cross-attention layers, enabling the model to selectively attend to individual words or phrases while synthesizing specific spatial regions and temporal segments of the video\n[\n190\n,\n191\n]\n. This mechanism allows linguistic concepts to exert fine-grained, context-dependent influence, while preserving temporal consistency across frames.\nImage-to-Video (I2V) Generation.\nImage-to-Video (I2V) generation pipelines synthesize a video from a reference image (usually the first frame) and optionally a text prompt. The initial frame provides contextual information that seeds the generation process\n[\n81\n,\n175\n]\n.\nExisting approaches generally incorporate image conditioning through either frame-level input concatenation or cross-layer attention. For low-level, frame-aligned conditioning, the conditioning frames are concatenated with the video input along the temporal or channel dimension. For higher-level semantic guidance, the image features (extracted using pretrained encoders such as CLIP\n[\n100\n]\n) are incorporated via cross-attention layers, either independently or jointly with text tokens.\nMotion/Trajectory-Guided Generation..\nPrior work\n[\n192\n]\nencodes motion trajectories as coordinate maps, optical flow fields, keypoint heatmaps, or applied forces, which are injected via channel concatenation, dense cross-attention, or specialized conditioning adapters such as ControlNet\n[\n193\n]\n. More recent efforts focus on embodiment-specific video models tailored to robots, directly conditioning on low-level robot states or actions (e.g., joint positions or torques)\n[\n11\n,\n17\n,\n16\n,\n194\n,\n30\n]\n.\nThe fine-grained conditioning inputs enable impressive controllability and physical grounding of the generated videos.\n2.3\nVideo Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture Models\nHere, we discuss methods based on joint-embedding predictive architectures (JEPAs)\n[\n76\n,\n77\n,\n79\n]\nthat learn world models from internet-scale videos for future prediction, video understanding, and planning in latent space.\nIn contrast to diffusion/flow-matching video models, which prioritize photorealistic video generation, video JEPA models\n[\n77\n,\n79\n]\nseek to learn effective latent representations through self-supervised training on video data. These latent representations form a foundational component for robust video understanding in downstream tasks, such as video question answering, motion understanding, and action recognition, using task-specific models trained on latent features extracted by JEPA models. Importantly, JEPA models\n[\n79\n]\ncan be directly applied to robot planning by conditioning the JEPA backbone on robot actions during the training process.\nJEPAs build on contrastive learning approaches for effective self-supervised learning. Next, we review contrastive methods before discussing JEPA methods.\nContrastive learning.\nContrastive-based methods learn latent space representations that identify salient characteristic features of (image) inputs to distinguish between similar and dissimilar (image) pairs. Under the assumption of separability of the inputs, contrastive models map inputs to a latent space such that similar data are encoded close together in the latent space while differing inputs are further apart.\nContrastive learning\n[\n195\n]\ntypically applies random transformations, such as cropping, resizing, color distortions, or noise injection, to generate augmentations of an input data point. Subsequently, the augmented inputs are mapped to latent embeddings using a learned model, which is trained using the InfoNCE loss function:\nℒ\ni\n,\nj\n=\n−\nlog\n⁡\nexp\n⁡\n(\nsim\n​\n(\nz\ni\n,\nz\nj\n)\n/\nτ\n)\n∑\nk\n=\n1\n2\n​\nN\n𝟙\nk\n≠\ni\n​\nexp\n⁡\n(\nsim\n​\n(\nz\ni\n,\nz\nk\n)\n/\nτ\n)\n,\n\\displaystyle\\mathcal{L}_{i,j}=-\\log\\frac{\\exp(\\text{sim}(z_{i},z_{j})/\\tau)}{\\sum_{k=1}^{2N}\\mathbbm{1}_{k\\neq i}\\exp(\\text{sim}(z_{i},z_{k})/\\tau)},\n(12)\nwhere\nsim\n​\n(\n⋅\n)\n\\text{sim}(\\cdot)\ncorresponds to the normalized dot product of the two vectors, given a positive image pair\n(\nx\ni\n,\nx\nj\n)\n{(x_{i},x_{j})}\nfrom a dataset of\nN\nN\nimage pairs.\nContrastive learning suffers from two core issues. First, since positive pairs come from different augmentations of the same image, other similar images are treated as negative examples, forcing the model to push apart representations that should be close. Second, these methods are prone to representation collapse, where the encoder learns to produce a trivial solution for all inputs.\nTo address these challenges, Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL)\n[\n196\n]\nintroduces a slow-moving teacher network that guides a student network. During training, the teacher network’s weights are updated as an exponential moving average of the student’s weights. In place of a contrastive loss, BYOL minimizes a normalized mean squared error between the student’s and teacher’s predictions, stabilizing training and enabling effective representation learning using only positive pairs. DINO encoders\n[\n197\n,\n198\n,\n199\n]\nbuild upon BYOL by recasting the teacher-student framework as a knowledge distillation process, where the student learns to match the teacher network’s probability distribution over\nK\nK\nclasses by minimizing the cross-entropy loss between the predicted probabilities.\nJoint-Embedding Predictive Architecture.\nJoint-embedding predictive architectures\n[\n76\n]\nextend self-supervised learning (e.g., BYOL) to the predictive domain through the introduction of a predictor and a conditioning variable to steer the outputs. To avoid representation collapse, JEPAs utilize an asymmetric architecture for embedding input images, composed of a student encoder, target encoder, and predictor.\nVideo joint-embedding predictive architecture (V-JEPA) models\n[\n77\n,\n79\n]\nbuild upon this foundation for video generation, predicting spatially and temporally masked features within the latent space. By making predictions within the latent space as opposed to pixel space, the model is encouraged to predict higher-level representations rather than pixel-level information\n[\n78\n]\n. This abstract understanding allows the model to build an internal world model, enabling it to also make predictions about future states and plan without task-specific training or reward.\nTo train a V-JEPA video model, masked video frames are passed to an encoder\nE\nθ\nE_{\\theta}\n, while the unmasked frames are fed into an exponential moving average of\nE\nθ\nE_{\\theta}\n, denoted by\nE\nθ\n¯\nE_{\\bar{\\theta}}\n. Given these embeddings, a predictor network\nP\nϕ\nP_{\\phi}\ncomputes the latent representations of the masked frames conditioned on a learnable mask token\nΔ\ny\n\\Delta_{y}\n. The model is trained with the loss function:\nmin\nθ\n,\nϕ\n,\nΔ\ny\n​\n‖\nP\nϕ\n​\n(\nΔ\ny\n,\nE\nθ\n​\n(\nx\n)\n)\n−\nsg\n​\n(\nE\nθ\n¯\n​\n(\ny\n)\n)\n‖\n1\n,\n\\displaystyle\\min_{\\theta,\\phi,\\Delta_{y}}||P_{\\phi}(\\Delta_{y},E_{\\theta}(x))-\\text{sg}(E_{\\bar{\\theta}}(y))||_{1},\nwhere\nsg\n​\n(\n⋅\n)\n\\text{sg}(\\cdot)\nstands for the stop-gradient operator.\nAfter\nE\nθ\nE_{\\theta}\nhas been trained, it can be frozen and used to train a transition model with additional action-labeled trajectory data\n[\n79\n]\n. JEPA models are still prone to representation collapse\n[\n200\n]\n, although they are more robust compared to prior approaches. Regularizers\n[\n201\n,\n202\n]\nhave been shown to help prevent posterior collapse, but are difficult to tune and interpret\n[\n200\n]\n.\n3\nApplications of Video Models in Robotics\nIn this section, we explore applications of video models as high-fidelity world models in robotics.\nWorld models capture the evolution of an environment under the effects of actions applied by an agent. However, modeling physical interactions is extremely challenging, given the stochastic nature of dynamical interactions, which is often not fully described by simplified physical laws.\nAlthough early world models\n[\n69\n,\n154\n]\neffectively learn high-level scene dynamics, they struggle with modeling intricate dynamical changes, especially with high-fidelity. Notably, in fine-grained interaction tasks in robotics, such as dexterous manipulation, these models often fail to predict the effect of subtle changes in robot actions that have significant impacts on the success of such tasks.\nFor high-fidelity world modeling, these models generally require lots of training data centered around such dynamical events for effective supervision, which is often difficult to collect in many practical applications.\nMore traditional physics-based simulators function as world models; however, their capabilities are often limited by restrictive assumptions built on simplified object models and dynamics models. For example, physics-based simulators typically struggle with deformable-body simulations, which require higher-fidelity dynamics model. Importantly, these assumptions contribute to the sim-to-real gap faced by physics-based simulators, e.g., through the use of primitive object shapes, appearance and visual conditions.\nRecent work in robotics seeks to address these limitations by leveraging video models as\nembodied world models\n.\nFigure 4:\nVideo Models for Embodied World Modeling.\nVideo models provide high-quality representations of the physical world, which could be implicit (e.g., latent and video representations) or explicit (e.g., point clouds and Gaussian Splatting models).\nVideo models can generate high-quality predictions of the future state of the physical world without a prohibitive demand for large-scale action-labeled datasets. In general, recent approaches\n[\n203\n,\n26\n,\n204\n,\n25\n,\n8\n]\nfine-tune pre-trained video models to synthesize high-accuracy 4D scene representations autoregressively, repeatedly generating future frames conditioned on the previously generated video frames. Video world models can be classified into two categories, based on the maintained scene representation, namely:\nimplicit\nand\nexplicit\nvideo world models, as illustrated in\nFigure\n4\n.\nImplicit video world models.\nIn implicit video world models, the 3D scene representation is encoded exclusively within the video model, without any external representation.\nAs such, visualization of the evolving scene can only be achieved by generating videos from the video model.\nWhile some methods\n[\n203\n]\nonly support text-conditioned video generation, others\n[\n26\n,\n205\n,\n25\n,\n157\n,\n206\n,\n207\n]\nfine-tune these models on robot datasets, e.g., Bridge\n[\n208\n]\n, DROID\n[\n209\n]\n, etc., for action-conditioned generation using robot actions. Pandora\n[\n203\n]\nenables finer control over longer-duration videos by fine-tuning the DynamicCrafter video model\n[\n210\n]\nfor text-conditioned video generation with language instructions for any video frame. Similarly, FreeAction\n[\n194\n]\nmodulates classifier-free guidance with the magnitude of the input actions to improve action-conditioned video generation.\nLikewise, Vid2World\n[\n25\n]\nextends the DynamicCrafter video model to autoregressive action-conditioned video generation using casual attention and diffusion forcing\n[\n126\n]\n.\nOther approaches fine-tune video models to predict a target object’s dynamics for object-centric video generation\n[\n211\n]\nand also explore wrist-camera video generation\n[\n205\n]\ngiven only scene-camera input images.\nExplicit video world models.\nIn contrast to implicit video world models, explicit video world models create a concrete 3D scene representation using video models, e.g., with multi-view videos or depth maps.\nFor example, Enerverse\n[\n26\n]\ntrains an autoregressive video generation model on multi-view video data conditioned on text and image inputs using simulation data since many open-source large-scale robot datasets lack multi-view inputs. The resulting multi-view video frames provide a sparse representation of the 3D world, which might not be detailed enough in fine robotics tasks. Consequently, Enerverse trains a 4D Gaussian Splatting scene representation\n[\n212\n]\nfor high-fidelity novel-view synthesis. In contrast, Aether\n[\n204\n]\nfine-tunes a video model (CogVideoX\n[\n129\n]\n) to generate depth and camera raymap videos, from which a 3D scene representation is extracted via back-projection.\nOther methods\n[\n213\n]\nconstruct a voxel-grid scene representation of the world from generated videos, which also serves as a memory bank for the video model.\nGenie Envisioner\n[\n27\n]\ntrains a video generation model alongside an action decoder to create a world model amenable to action prediction, policy evaluation, and data generation. With its action decoder, Genie Envisioner transforms latent video states to predicted actions given a language-conditioned robot task, and uses the video model for policy rollouts.\nThe high-fidelity world modeling capabilities of video models enable a broad range of downstram robotics applications, including: (i) efficient data generation and action prediction in imitation learning, (ii) expressive dynamics and rewards modeling in reinforcement learning, (iii) scalable policy evaluation, and (iv) visual planning.\n3.1\nCost-Effective Data Generation and Action Prediction in Imitation Learning\nIn recent years, impressive research advances in robotics have been driven by imitation learning on large-scale expert demonstrations, circumventing the well-documented challenges associated with explicitly modeling dynamical interactions between robots and their environments. For example, SOTA vision-language-action (VLA) models\n[\n23\n,\n24\n,\n214\n,\n215\n]\nhave demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generalist language-conditioned robot manipulation, exhibiting strong task and environment generalization and robust recovery behaviors in the presence of disturbances. Scaling foundation models in terms of model and training data size has proven to be essential to realizing these significant leaps in performance, a fact that has been further underscored by the success of LLMs trained on internet-scale data. Although this path to advancing robot learning holds significant promise, the costs associated with collecting large-scale expert demonstrations, such as time and labor costs, pose notable challenges.\nTo address this challenge, recent work\n[\n216\n,\n83\n,\n12\n,\n118\n,\n217\n,\n218\n]\nemploys video generation models as cost-effective data generators of expert demonstrations, eliminating the overhead associated with human-supervised data collection.\nConcurrently, recent research has explored the use of video models as policy backbones in imitation learning, seeking to harness the synergies between dynamics prediction and policy learning to ground proposed robot actions.\nWe present these application areas in the subsequent discussion.\nFigure 5:\nVideo Models for Data Generation.\nVideo models enable high-fidelity data generation for cost-effective policy learning. Robot actions can be extracted from videos through modular approaches using end-effector pose tracking or end-to-end approaches, such as inverse-dynamics methods.\nVideo Models as Data Generators.\nFor scalable data generation, existing methods fine-tune pre-trained video models, such as Cosmos Predict\n[\n219\n]\nand Wan\n[\n10\n]\n, on robot datasets for adaptation to robot embodiments and environments.\nHowever, the expressiveness of text-conditioned and image-conditioned video models is often too limited to capture the diversity of the training data required to train generalizable robot policies. Subsequent research on controllable video models\n[\n220\n,\n221\n,\n222\n,\n118\n]\nseek to overcome this limitation through finer control of camera and object motion in generated videos, given an input text, image, keypoints, or trajectory vectors, describing spatial changes in the scene temporally.\nSome methods\n[\n218\n]\nfurther decompose the task into a set of subtasks for generating keyframes, which serve as conditioning inputs to generate video data for longer-horizon tasks.\nOther methods train video models for effective cross-embodiment transfer.\nFor example, Human2Robot\n[\n216\n]\ntrains a video model to generate robot videos given human videos, from which robot actions are estimated.\nThe resulting action-annotated data is used for policy learning, e.g., with VLA models\n[\n12\n,\n219\n]\n, or directly applied to a robot\n[\n36\n,\n37\n,\n223\n]\n.\nIn general, robot data generation methods recover robot actions from generated videos using an end-to-end approach or a modular approach, which is illustrated in\nFigure\n5\n.\nEnd-to-end methods typically utilize latent action models or inverse-dynamics models to estimate actions from videos. Latent action models\n[\n224\n,\n122\n,\n123\n]\ninfer actions that explain the transition between a pair of video frames in latent space without the need for ground-truth actions, which often resides in a different action space. To learn latent actions without supervision, existing methods train an encoder-decoder model with a reconstruction-based loss function, generally implemented in latent space. The encoder takes in a pair of frames and outputs a latent action, which is passed into the decoder to recover the future frame. SOTA latent action models use VQ-VAEs as the model architecture for the encoder and decoder, given the superior tradeoff offered by VQ-VAEs in terms of expressiveness and training efficiency. Given the non-equivalence between the action space of the ground-truth and latent actions, latent action models often require a subsequent fine-tuning stage at deployment time to align the ground-truth and latent action spaces using a small set of action-labeled data.\nUnlike latent action models, inverse-dynamics models (IDMs)\n[\n225\n,\n124\n,\n125\n]\nlearn to predict actions from videos in a supervised fashion from action-labeled video data. Recent methods parameterize the video-to-action mapping using an encoder-decoder model trained with a diffusion objective. Although the need for ground-truth action labels poses a challenge to IDMs, IDMs do not require a fine-tuning stage, enabling zero-shot deployment.\nFor example, DreamGen\n[\n12\n]\ntrains an IDM using action-annotated robot datasets for action estimation.\nLikewise, Video Prediction Policy (VPP)\n[\n226\n]\ntrains an IDM based on a diffusion model architecture to regress robot actions from latent features generated by a text-conditioned video model.\nARDuP\n[\n227\n]\nand Vidar\n[\n217\n]\nemploy a similar approach. Whereas Vidar supervises the IDM by predicting action-relevant regions of the videos, ARDuP directly feeds active region masks to the video model as conditioning inputs.\nBroadly, modular approaches estimate the target object’s pose in each video frame. Some of these methods\n[\n82\n,\n83\n,\n84\n]\nutilize learned pose trackers\n[\n228\n,\n229\n]\nand monocular depth estimators\n[\n230\n]\nfor 3D object pose estimation from 2D image keypoints.\nFurther, methods such as AVDC\n[\n38\n]\nand VideoAgent\n[\n85\n]\nuse an off-the-shelf optical flow predictor to extract pixel movement, from which the motion of the target object is estimated.\nOther methods\n[\n86\n]\nestimate the target object’s pose using computer-aided design (CAD) models. The resulting object trajectory is subsequently retargeted (i.e., applied) to the robot, under the assumption that a fixed rigid transformation exists between the object’s reference point and the robot’s end-effector.\nBy taking advantage of low-level control routines, these methods can be deployed zero-shot without the need for a separate fine-tuning stage for aligning the action spaces between training and deployment.\nVideo Models as Policy Backbones.\nUsing video models as policy backbones, unified video-action methods train robot policies to jointly predict videos and actions conditioned on a language instruction and initial observation. While most unified video-action methods\n[\n231\n,\n232\n,\n87\n,\n233\n]\nutilize a VLA architecture for these policies, more recent work\n[\n234\n,\n41\n,\n235\n]\ndirectly adapts pre-trained video models for joint video and action generation.\nGR1\n[\n236\n,\n232\n]\ntrains an autoregressive transformer-based model to jointly predict future images and actions, given the language instruction, sequence of observation images, and a sequence of robot states.\nRPT\n[\n231\n]\ntakes a masking-based training approach, by masking the model’s inputs, e.g. actions, images, or robot states, before action prediction.\nIn contrast, UVA\n[\n87\n]\ntrains an encoder to learn a joint latent representation over video frames and actions. The resulting latent embeddings are used in training an autoregressive transformer for action prediction, video generation, and inverse-dynamics modeling.\nUnlike UVA, PAD\n[\n237\n]\nand Video Policy\n[\n234\n]\nuse a pre-trained Stable Diffusion encoder\n[\n179\n]\nwith diffusion transformers or U-Nets for video and action generation, reducing training overhead.\nLike UVA, UWM\n[\n233\n]\nuses independent diffusion processes for action and video generation.\nMeanwhile, DreamVLA\n[\n88\n]\nfurther supervises the VLA with depth maps, dynamic regions, and semantic feature prediction to more strongly guide the model in learning useful features.\nLikewise, UniVLA\n[\n238\n]\nintroduces stronger supervisory signals into the training process by predicting language tokens (e.g., text descriptions) in addition to video frames and actions.\n3.2\nDynamics and Rewards Modeling in Reinforcement Learning\nFigure 6:\nDynamics and Rewards Modeling.\nVideo models provide high-accuracy dynamics modeling and rich reward signals, which are essential in reinforcement learning, circumventing long-standing challenges in system identification and reward engineering.\nAs discussed in the preceding subsection, SOTA robot policies are generally trained using imitation learning, which provides more efficient training compared to reinforcement learning (RL) but does not generalize well outside of the training data distribution. Although RL circumvents this challenge, RL requires the specification of dynamics and rewards models, which are often non-trivial in many practical problems. Further, RL suffers from low sample efficiency, requiring large amounts of training data to achieve the same level of performance as imitation-learned policies. Recent research seeks to address these limitations by using generative video models as expressive dynamics and rewards models in RL, shown in\nFigure\n6\n.\nWhereas earlier work utilized recurrent state-space models\n[\n239\n]\nor image diffusion models\n[\n240\n]\nfor dynamics prediction, more\nrecent work trains video diffusion models, which provide higher-fidelity predictions that are more physically consistent.\nDreamer 4\n[\n31\n]\ntrains an action-conditioned video model from scratch by first training a text-conditioned video model and subsequently fine-tuning the model on action-labeled data.\nThe resulting action-conditioned video model serves as a dynamics predictor to fine-tune imitation-learned policy and reward heads using RL, e.g., in Minecraft.\nIn contrast, World-Env\n[\n32\n]\nuses a pre-trained action-conditioned video model\n[\n89\n]\nfor video generation and a VLM (instance reflector) for dense reward signals\nto fine-tune a VLA using RL.\nAnother subclass of methods directly use video models as reward models in RL. While VIPER\n[\n33\n]\nuses the video prediction likelihood as the reward signal, Diffusion Reward\n[\n34\n]\nuses the conditional entropy of the video generation distribution as the reward signal, inspired by the idea that video trajectories closer to the expert trajectories seen in the training data have lower entropy.\nFurther, the work in\n[\n90\n]\nuses a video model to generate videos that guide exploration during robot policy learning. The resulting experience is saved to a buffer for fine-tuning the policy. Although this work uses a goal-conditioned policy, where the video frames serve as image subgoals, the approach can be applied to RL.\n3.3\nScalable Policy Evaluation\nBeyond policy learning, video models enable reliable policy evaluation that is reproducible across different environments and task settings. Real-world evaluation of robot manipulation policies is notably challenging due to the significant inherent hardware and labor costs, especially for generalist robot policies, which typically require evaluation across a combinatorial number of operating environments. For example, each hardware trial requires human monitoring to reset the environment, observe the policy rollout, and record success scores, which is expensive.\nWhile hardware evaluation is the gold-standard, policy evaluation in simulation is the best available alternative, especially with recent improvements in visual fidelity, system identification, and careful tuning of material properties. However, physics-based simulation requires significant setup time, as each real environment needs to be manually recreated, including the careful tuning of several parameters such as lighting and material properties to minimize the sim-to-real gap.\nIn contrast, video models\n[\n241\n,\n242\n,\n243\n]\noffer a higher-fidelity, more scalable framework for policy evaluation, modeling intricate robot-environment interactions that are challenging for physics-based simulators, e.g., in deformable-body simulation.\nHere, we survey a growing body of research on the application of video models to policy evaluation, including policy comparison and estimation of real-world success rates\n[\n16\n,\n17\n,\n26\n,\n29\n,\n91\n,\n92\n,\n93\n,\n30\n]\n. These studies demonstrate that video models can offer useful sanity checks prior to real-world policy deployment.\nReal-world success rates can be estimated by rolling out the policy in closed-loop with a video model on sampled initial observations (e.g., camera images) and task instructions.\nTo improve the quality and consistency of video generation, some architectures\n[\n91\n]\ncondition the video model on the latent action representation in the policy, instead of conditioning on the robot’s physical actions\n[\n17\n,\n16\n]\n. As robot manipulation setups often involve multiple camera views, several architectures are adapted for consistent multi-view generation\n[\n17\n,\n30\n,\n26\n,\n93\n]\n, which has been empirically shown to reduce hallucinations\n[\n17\n]\n. To further mitigate prediction errors that accumulate over long rollouts, existing methods incorporate history during video generation, conditioning future video frames not only on the current observation but also on past observations. The history may consist of all frames within a fixed window length\n[\n92\n,\n16\n,\n29\n]\nor a sparsely sampled subset of past frames\n[\n17\n,\n26\n]\n. Moreover, augmenting observations with corresponding robot joint poses has been shown to improve frame-level action controllability\n[\n17\n]\n.\nEach rollout is scored according to a rubric to quantify success (e.g., Bernoulli score, partial credit) on task completion and instruction following, and the scores of individual rollouts are aggregated into empirical success rates.\nTo assess the accuracy of video models in policy evaluation, existing approaches\n[\n30\n,\n17\n,\n93\n]\nuse metrics such as the Pearson correlation coefficient and the Mean Maximum Rank Violation (MMRV). The Pearson correlation coefficient measures the strength of the linear relationship between predicted and real-world success rates — a high correlation is achieved when policies with high real-world success rates also exhibit high success rates in video model evaluations, and policies with low real success rates similarly have low video model success rates. In contrast, rank violation captures ranking inconsistencies between policy pairs, weighting each violation by the absolute difference in real-world success rates. The MMRV score is computed as the average across policies of their maximum rank violations.\nAlthough the predicted and real-world success rates do not always match, the evaluation results provide valuable insights for ranking the relative performance of policies, which is essential in improving robot policies in subsequent design and training stages.\nFurthermore, video models can also be used to assess the robustness and safety of robot policies, particularly in out-of-distribution conditions\n[\n30\n,\n16\n]\n. In the Veo World Simulator\n[\n30\n]\n, such out-of-distribution scenarios can be rapidly constructed via image editing, e.g., to alter the background or add novel objects and distractors. This pipeline enables the use of video models to consistently predict performance degradation along different axes of generalization. Additionally, the pipeline can be readily interfaced with a VLM to generate safety-critical scenes and tasks for testing whether the policy executes semantically or physically unsafe behavior\n[\n30\n]\n.\nFor accurate predictions across successful and failure scenarios, existing methods\n[\n29\n,\n93\n,\n92\n]\nincorporate failure data when training video models to avoid a bias towards always predicting success, which we discuss further in\nSection\n5.9\n.\n3.4\nVisual Planning\nRobot planning offers a compelling alternative to imitation learning, enabling impressive generalization beyond the distribution of the training dataset.\nHowever, the design of high-fidelity models that closely predict the scene dynamics often proves prohibitively challenging. To address these drawbacks, recent work has explored utilizing video models in\nvisual planning\n, defined as the problem of synthesizing a sequence of images or video frames that show the steps necessary to complete a task specified by a language instruction and an initial observation. By leveraging the extensive diversity of the training data encoded by video models, these methods circumvent the need for large-scale expert demonstrations or explicit dynamics models to solve a broad range of robot tasks.\nVisual planning methods\n[\n244\n]\ngenerally optimize the generated video plans using sampling-based trajectory optimization methods, such as the gradient-free cross-entropy method, or gradient-based methods, e.g., gradient descent or Levenberg-Marquardt optimizers. The optimization routine is often embedded within a model predictive control (MPC) framework, facilitating the incorporation of new observations during planning via sensor feedback.\nVideo-model-based visual planning methods can utilize\naction-guided\nor\naction-free\napproaches to create feasible robot trajectories.\nAction-Guided Visual Planning.\nAction-guided visual planning methods utilize a three-step approach, which consists of: generating action proposals, synthesizing video trajectories using video models as dynamics prediction modules given these action proposals, and subsequently evaluating the resulting video trajectories based on an objective function. Broadly, the action proposals are typically generated by sampling-based approaches\n[\n39\n]\n, learned approaches\n[\n15\n]\n, or VLMs\n[\n94\n,\n14\n]\n. The work in\n[\n39\n]\nuses the cross-entropy method to generate action proposals, optimizing the photometric/Euclidean error between a user-provided goal image or keypoints and the video frames generated by the video model conditioned on the proposed actions. The action samples are drawn by fitting a Gaussian distribution to the actions associated with the minimum objective value and sampling from the resulting Gaussian. Similarly, FLIP\n[\n15\n]\nuses a conditional variational autoencoder to generate action proposals and fine-tunes a language-image value network\n[\n245\n]\nto learn a value function over the generated video trajectories. The action that maximizes the discounted return is selected for execution.\nIn contrast to these approaches, MindJourney\n[\n94\n]\nuses a VLM to propose candidate camera trajectories and to evaluate the generated video trajectories from a video model given these action proposals.\nLikewise, the work in\n[\n14\n]\nuses a VLM for task decomposition, breaking down the language-specified task into subtasks in natural-language, which serve as text inputs for the video model. The VLM further analyzes the generated videos to expand and refine the subtasks using a tree-search-based approach. Subsequently, a goal-conditioned policy predicts robot actions from the best video plan. VLP\n[\n95\n]\ntakes a similar approach, integrating a video model with an LLM, which analyzes the generated videos and selects a final plan for execution.\nAction-Free Visual Planning.\nAction-free visual planning methods do not utilize action proposals for planning. Rather, these methods generate video plans directly from text-conditioned video models and use the video frames as image subgoals for planning.\nPrior work\n[\n96\n]\nuses goal-conditioned behavior cloning for extracting robot actions from the image subgoals. In contrast, CLOVER\n[\n40\n]\ntrains an IDM that maps the current image observation and image subgoals to robot actions. The IDM is further conditioned on the error between the image embeddings of the current observation and image subgoals for stronger feedback.\nSimilarly, UniPi\n[\n246\n]\nuses an IDM for action estimation but also introduces a super-resolution video generation phase that refines coarse video trajectories into finer video plans.\nIn contrast, NovaFlow\n[\n13\n]\nextracts the object pose (represented by particles in the case of deformable objects) from generated videos, which serve as coarse robot actions. The resulting action plan serves as a reference trajectory that is refined using non-linear least-squares optimization with a pre-trained particle-based dynamics model.\n4\nEvaluating Video Models\nIn this section, we present standard metrics and benchmarks for evaluating video models across different dimensions, including perceptual quality, physical consistency, and semantic alignment with the input prompts.\n4.1\nMetrics for Evaluating Video Models\nTo assess video generation quality in accordance with human judgment, various metrics are needed to evaluate video models on visual quality, temporal coherence, diversity of generation, and physical commonsense.\nAlthough many traditional image quality metrics\n[\n97\n,\n98\n,\n247\n]\nexist, these metrics do not assess temporal consistency of generated videos. To address this limitation, recent work\n[\n101\n,\n101\n]\nhas introduced video-specific metrics that measure video quality both spatially and temporally.\nAdditionally, application-focused metrics are equally important. For example, in policy evaluation, the usefulness of an action-conditioned video generation model depends on how well it can predict policy success rate, and in policy learning, whether the generated demonstration data results in more performant policies\n[\n12\n]\n.\nHere, we discuss frame-level metrics and spatiotemporal consistency metrics.\nFrame-level Metrics.\nTraditional frame-level metrics from computer vision can be used to assess video generation quality, such as the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR)\n[\n97\n]\nand structural similarity index (SSIM)\n[\n98\n]\n.\nUnlike PSNR, which is inversely proportional to the mean squared error of the pixel values, SSIM assesses image quality on luminance, contrast, and structure, which is more indicative of perceived similarity. Pixel-based metrics often fail to capture higher-order image structures that align with human perceptual judgments\n[\n98\n]\n, which might be better represented in the learned feature spaces of deep models. For instance, the CLIP similarity score uses the cosine similarity between images in the embedding space\n[\n100\n]\nto assess semantic alignment between a pair of images. For generative models, the inception score\n[\n248\n]\nassesses if the model confidently generates diverse, yet semantically meaningful images by computing the expected KL-divergence between the predicted class distribution and the marginal distribution of all generated images. However, the inception score does not use real samples, depends on a fixed label space, and is not suited for image generation without a target object. The Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)\n[\n249\n]\naddresses these challenges by computing the Wasserstein-2 distance between multi-dimensional Gaussian distributions over the real and generated feature embeddings. Likewise, the Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS)\n[\n99\n]\nis a similarity score on feature embeddings from several layers of a deep image recognition network, which has been shown to be comparable to human judgments. Furthermore, recent work\n[\n247\n]\nhas demonstrated that these perceptual metrics can be learned to further align with human judgments.\nSpatiotemporal Metrics.\nWhile frame-level metrics focus on visual representation at any given video frame, assessing the temporal coherence of videos is also important for evaluating video generation quality. The Fréchet Video Distance (FVD)\n[\n101\n]\naccomplishes this by extending the Fréchet Inception Distance temporally to video representations that capture motion features across frames as well as the quality of images per frame.\nInstead of assuming a Gaussian representation for the features, the Kernel Video Distance (KVD)\n[\n101\n]\nuses a kernel-based metric (maximum mean discrepancy), to capture higher-order variations. The Fréchet Video Motion Distance (FVMD) computes the Fréchet distance on motion features by extracting keypoints that can be tracked across multiple frames and computing their velocities and accelerations.\nPrior work has also employed optical flow\n[\n250\n,\n10\n,\n102\n]\nto assess temporal coherence and VLMs\n[\n44\n,\n12\n]\nto evaluate physical consistency of generated videos.\n4.2\nBenchmarks for Evaluating Video Models\nDespite their impressive capabilities, video models tend to generate videos that violate specific desired qualities, such as physical consistency, even when these videos are of high visual quality. Prior work\n[\n251\n,\n48\n,\n252\n]\nhas introduced benchmarks to assess the performance of video models across different criteria, spanning visual quality, dynamic consistency, and instruction following.\nBy evaluating video models across many dimensions, these benchmarks highlight critical areas for future research, in addition to identifying SOTA video models.\nGenerally, existing benchmarks demonstrate that video models fail to follow physical laws, even after scaling these models, although their aesthetic quality and temporal consistency tend to improve with scale.\nWhile many existing benchmarks evaluate the overall quality or physical consistency of generated videos from video models, only a few benchmarks assess the safety of generated videos. These safety benchmarks\n[\n53\n,\n52\n]\nprovide an extensive evaluation of the safety of video models, demonstrating their tendency to generate illegal or unethical videos that violate their safety guidelines.\nIn the subsequent discussion, we present benchmarks that examine the overall quality of video models broadly and those that focus on evaluating physical commonsense.\nBroad Benchmarks.\nWorldModelBench\n[\n48\n]\nintroduces a benchmark to evaluate the instruction following and physics adherence capabilities of video models, identifying physically inconsistent changes in the sizes of objects, which violates the law of mass conservation.\nFurther, EvalCrafter\n[\n103\n]\nevaluates the quality of generated videos in terms of their aesthetic and motion quality as well as temporal consistency and text-to-video alignment. While visual quality is assessed using DOVER\n[\n253\n]\n, motion quality is evaluated using action recognition methods, which are based on the activity classes in the Kinetics 400 dataset\n[\n254\n]\n. Temporal consistency and text-to-video alignment are measured using optical flow and CLIP, respectively.\nEvalCrafter shows that its evaluation criteria are well-aligned with human preferences.\nEWMBench\n[\n255\n]\nalso evaluates video models along similar axes but uses the cosine-similarity metric with DINOv2\n[\n198\n]\nembeddings to measure visual consistency.\nFurthermore, VBench\n[\n104\n]\nexamines the performance of video models across sixteen fine-grained criteria, such as background consistency, subject consistency, and temporal flickering, in addition to aesthetic and semantic quality and instruction following.\nLike other benchmarks, VBench demonstrates that the results of each video model on each criterion is highly correlated with human preferences.\nLikewise, PAI-Bench\n[\n252\n]\ncompares video models based on the temporal consistency, motion smoothness, and aesthetic quality of their generated videos.\nBeyond measuring overall video consistency, T2V-CompBench\n[\n105\n]\nevaluates object attribute consistency, such as color, shape, and texture, along with action consistency in generated videos. Similarly, WorldSimBench\n[\n47\n]\nassesses the physical consistency of motion, particularly the perception of a sense of depth, and changes in the velocity of objects in different media such as air and water.\nPhysical Commonsense.\nOther benchmarks focus primarily on evaluating the physical commonsense of video models\n[\n108\n,\n43\n]\n.\nFor example, Physics-IQ\n[\n43\n]\nassesses video models’ understanding of the laws of physics, such as those on optics, thermodynamics, magnetism and fluid dynamics, demonstrating that video models lack a solid understanding of physical laws.\nLikewise, PhyGenBench\n[\n45\n]\nmeasures the commensense knowledge of video models on\n27\n27\nphysical laws, including gravity, sublimation, solubility, and friction, across\n160\n160\nprompts. VideoPhy\n[\n44\n]\nevaluates video models along similar axes, focusing more on object interactions.\nVP\n2\n\\text{VP}^{2}\n[\n106\n]\nexamines the alignment of video models with physical laws in the task of visual planning, demonstrating that strong performance on perceptual metrics is generally not indicative of alignment with physical consistency. Further,\nVP\n2\n\\text{VP}^{2}\n[\n106\n]\nshows that although scaling the model size and training dataset improves performance, the resulting gains plateau relatively quickly.\n5\nOpen Challenges and Future Directions\nWe identify open research challenges in robotics applications of video models and highlight directions for future research to address these challenges. We note that solutions to these challenges apply broadly beyond robotics, which could motivate novel applications of video models.\n5.1\nHallucinations and Violations of Physics\nDespite their impressive capabilities, video models often hallucinate, generating implausible video frames that are temporally inconsistent or misaligned with physical reality.\nIn T2V generation, recent works\n[\n256\n,\n257\n,\n46\n]\nhave explored different types of hallucinations, including vanishing subject, omission error, numeric variability, visual incongruity, and subject dysmorphia\n[\n256\n]\n, and have proposed hallucination detectors.\nIn robotics, the challenge of hallucination is especially important, given the critical role of accurate future prediction in policy evaluation and visual planning, among other application areas.\nRecent works have found that using multi-view frame inputs and particularly including a wrist camera view reduces hallucinations\n[\n17\n]\n.\nHowever, augmented conditioning inputs have limited effect on mitigating the violation of physics.\nSpecifically, video models typically fail to follow the laws of physics governing object motion and interactions\n[\n107\n,\n111\n]\n. Prior work\n[\n44\n,\n43\n,\n48\n]\nhas demonstrated that generated videos from these models violate fundamental principles, such as Newton’s law of motion, conservation of energy and mass, and gravitational effects, revealing a lack of understanding of these laws. Further, these models tend to mimic the closest training example when presented with a task at inference, limiting their generalization to new (unseen) tasks. In this setting, video models exhibit a propensity to prioritize transferring the color, size, velocity, and shape of objects in the training dataset to the objects in the new task, in that particular order\n[\n108\n,\n109\n]\n.\nFurther, existing work\n[\n44\n,\n45\n]\nshows that video models struggle with generating physically-realistic solid-solid interactions, demonstrating that video models do not understand the material properties of objects, the law of conservation of momentum, and the impenetrability of objects. Video models also show a fundamental lack of understanding of fluid mechanics and conservation of mass\n[\n43\n]\n, generating unrealistic videos of liquid flows, e.g., pouring a drink into a cup without a corresponding change in the volume of liquid in the cup.\nHowever, generating physically realistic data is crucial in robotics, such as in robot learning where the generated data serves as expert demonstrations for training a policy, highlighting the need to impart physical understanding to video models.\nMoreover, prompt engineering and scaling techniques do not adequately resolve this challenge, suggesting that novel architectures and training techniques are required to address this problem.\nNext, we discuss potential directions for future research to improve the physical consistency of videos generated by video models.\nFuture Directions.\nPhysical realism of generated videos from video models is essential in applications requiring trustworthy video generation, such as policy evaluation, planning, and policy learning, underscoring the importance of research on hallucination mitigation. To improve the physical consistency of generated videos, prior work\n[\n258\n,\n259\n,\n260\n,\n261\n]\nhas explored integrating physics-based priors and physics-based simulation with video generation.\nHamiltonian and Lagrangian approaches\n[\n258\n,\n259\n]\ntrain models to predict the dynamics of system based on Hamiltonian or Lagrangian mechanics. By encoding the laws of physics as priors in the training process, the resulting models tend to adhere better to the physical laws. Other methods employ simulation engines to enforce physical laws.\nFor example, PhysGen\n[\n260\n]\nextracts object segmentation masks and physical properties using VLMs and computes feasible trajectories for the annotated objects using rigid-body dynamics equations. Subsequently, the trajectories are applied to corresponding pixels for video generation. However, the resulting video often contains artifacts, which degrades its fidelity. PhysGen uses a video diffusion model to edit these artifacts to generate higher-quality videos\n[\n262\n]\n.\nLikewise, WonderPlay\n[\n261\n]\nconstructs a 3D scene representation from the conditioning inputs and estimates the physical properties of objects in the scene using a VLM. The scene and objects’ physical properties are passed into a physics-based simulator, which computes a coarse trajectory conditioned on applied forces.\nThe coarse trajectory from the simulator serve as conditioning inputs for a video model to generate future frames.\nOther methods\n[\n110\n]\nhave utilized LLMs to refine video models’ input prompts to provide comprehensive descriptions of physical attributes and interactions to improve the physical accuracy of generated videos.\nAlthough these methods improve physical alignment, they do not eliminate violations of the laws of physics. Specifically, LLMs/VLMs are prone to hallucinations\n[\n263\n]\n, which limits the effectiveness of the aforementioned methods.\nMoreover, these methods rely on ad-hoc solutions, negatively impacting their generality and ease of implementation.\nWe believe a promising future direction will be to explore efficient techniques for natively endowing video models with a fundamental understanding of physical laws, which might necessitate the design of novel training techniques and model architectures\n[\n264\n]\nthat enforce physical laws.\nAdditionally, improving the ability of video models to understand feasible interaction modes could be critical to mitigating hallucinations. Prior work has explored identifying and localizing functional interaction cues from videos, e.g., how humans interact with objects and environments, which is referred to as affordance-based video understanding\n[\n265\n,\n266\n]\n.\nExisting methods\n[\n267\n,\n268\n,\n269\n,\n270\n]\nlocalize interaction regions in videos and embed these cues into a latent space to predict the evolution of contact regions (hotspots) across future video frames.\nThe resulting affordance maps\n[\n271\n,\n272\n,\n273\n,\n274\n]\ncan serve as conditioning (guidance) signals in video synthesis to improve the physical consistency of generated videos. Developing effective strategies for incorporating these signals during video generation is an important area for future work.\n5.2\nUncertainty Quantification\nUncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques are widely utilized with traditional deep neural networks to examine the trustworthiness of these difficult-to-interpret models. While the rapid development of LLMs has led to increased research in UQ of large generative models to address severe hallucinations (see\n[\n275\n]\nfor a review of LLM UQ methods), UQ methods for image and video generation models remain largely underexplored.\nMeanwhile, extending existing UQ methods to video generation models faces significant challenges due to the complexity of spatial and temporal relationships. For example, generative video modeling fails to satisfy the central assumptions of standard Bayesian UQ methods, such as the assumption of independent, identically distributed samples, given the correlation between frames across multiple timesteps. Additionally, the significant computational cost associated with video generation impedes the application of ensemble-based UQ methods. Importantly, existing video models lack the ability to express or verbalize their confidence. As a result, inference-time UQ methods, e.g., black-box LLM UQ methods, cannot be directly applied to video models.\nFuture Directions.\nA few recent works have explored UQ techniques for controllable video generation, including text-conditioned and action-conditioned models.\nS-QUBED\n[\n46\n]\nquantifies uncertainty of T2V generation in the semantic space. However, this method only estimates task-level confidence on video generation.\nOn the other hand,\nC\n3\nC^{3}\n[\n111\n]\ntrains video models for simultaneous video generation and uncertainty quantification in latent space. Specifically,\nC\n3\nC^{3}\nenables video models to predict the uncertainty associated with each subpatch of the generated video, providing dense confidence estimates spatially and temporally.\nIn general, these methods are only guaranteed to provide calibrated uncertainty estimates within the distribution of the training dataset, limiting their effectiveness in out-of-distribution use-cases.\nA promising direction for future work will be to explore more cost-effective methods for uncertainty quantification with provable guarantees both within and beyond the training distribution.\n5.3\nInstruction Following\nLike early language models\n[\n276\n]\n, text-conditioned video models struggle with following user instructions specified in the input prompts\n[\n44\n,\n47\n]\n, which poses a significant limitation. Although these models are generally trained with guidance for alignment with the conditioning inputs, existing guidance mechanisms do not provide sufficient supervision to produce videos consistent with the input prompt. In general, SOTA video models often fail to complete the specified task due to their inability to extract and transfer the intended action from the conditioning input to the specified actor (agent). Prior work\n[\n48\n]\nhas shown that video models are generally able to correctly generate videos containing the agents stated in the input prompt but only partially follow the specified action and in some cases, completely fail to incorporate the specified action into the generated video.\nFurthermore, video models typically fail to generate high-quality text (annotations) in videos\n[\n103\n]\n, even in videos with otherwise high-fidelity components. This limitation becomes especially conspicuous when the input prompt specifically requests text annotations. Further, camera motion control via input prompts remains a major challenge for video models\n[\n255\n,\n103\n]\n. Even when asked to generate videos with a static camera viewpoint without panning, video models tend to mimic their training videos, which often contain camera motion, resulting in non-adherence to the input prompt.\nThese challenges limit robotics applications in data generation and policy learning, among others. For example, many robot data generation methods operate under the assumption of a static camera position for accurate\n3\n3\nD pose estimation of the robot’s end-effector pose through back-projection. Violation of this assumption results in inaccurate goal poses for tracking, degrading the robot’s task performance. Likewise, failure to generate videos that correctly follow the actions specified by the input prompt leads to training data corruption, limiting the effectiveness of imitation learning, which relies on high-quality (expert) demonstrations.\nFuture Directions.\nRecent work\n[\n112\n,\n113\n,\n114\n]\nhas explored improving the instruction-following capability of video models through multimodal conditioning. ViMi\n[\n112\n]\ninterleaves language and images into a single instruction prompt, which is passed into a VLM to extract a conditional embedding for video generation. Similarly, Aid\n[\n113\n]\nuses a VLM to predict the states of future video frames, which are fused with the text instruction to generate a conditional embedding for video synthesis. Other approaches\n[\n115\n,\n116\n]\nenable fine-grained multimodal user inputs to more strongly guide video models in the generation process. With InteractiveVideo\n[\n115\n]\n, users can control the content of generated videos through image, text, and trajectory prompts, describing the desired motion of different elements of the video scene. Similarly, ATI\n[\n116\n]\nenables localized control of deformations using keypoints and motion paths. Some other methods\n[\n117\n]\nhave examined instruction fine-tuning using preference-based reward models to train video models that are better at following user instructions.\nThe aforementioned approaches generally rely on VLMs or other learned models that are susceptible to hallucinations, limiting their practical effectiveness.\nTo address this challenge, a promising research direction will be to explore intrinsic methods for improving task understanding and instruction following, e.g., through inference-time “reasoning” over the generated video patches and frames, similar to the approach used in reasoning language models\n[\n19\n,\n277\n]\n.\n5.4\nEvaluating Video Models\nA unified framework for evaluating video models remains lacking, especially in the context of robotics applications.\nExisting metrics for evaluating video models generally assess either the perceptual quality\n[\n97\n,\n98\n,\n249\n]\nof their generated videos or their semantic consistency\n[\n100\n,\n198\n]\n. While visual quality may be prioritized in content generation, physical consistency and predictive accuracy are more critical in robotics\n[\n106\n]\n.\nGiven the lack of suitable metrics, researchers often resort to surrogate measures based on the downstream application, e.g., correlation between real and predicted policy success rates by video models, to approximate the performance of the video models\n[\n17\n]\n.\nAdditionally, many works rely on human judgment to evaluate video model performance\n[\n118\n]\n, which is qualitative, costly, and subject to bias.\nDesigning effective evaluation metrics is critical in assessing the performance of video models, which could further motivate directions for future development.\nFuture Directions.\nPrior works have developed benchmarks for evaluating video generation in terms of alignment with\ndownstream task performance\n[\n106\n,\n47\n]\n. However, the environment complexity and visual quality of these benchmarks are fundamentally limited by the simulators. Recent works have explored benchmarking and evaluating T2V generation without ground-truth videos along many axes, such as overall video quality, text-to-video alignment, motion quality, and temporal consistency\n[\n103\n]\n. To evaluate the quality of video models as embodied world models, WorldModelBench\n[\n48\n]\ntrains a VLM-based judge to assess video models in terms of instruction following, physics adherence, and commonsense.\nIn general, these benchmarks still lack the ability to assess video generation quality in fine-grained robot manipulation tasks.\nA promising direction for future research will be to explore robotics-centric benchmarks and multi-dimensional metrics for quantitative, efficient, and task-relevant video model evaluation. Further, future research on evaluation pipelines that compare the physical consistency of generated videos based on the corresponding motion in the associated\n3\n3\nD scene reconstructions will be important.\n5.5\nSafe Content Generation\nMany video models lack adequate safety guardrails, impeding their integration into many real-world applications.\nPrior work\n[\n53\n,\n52\n]\nhas demonstrated the propensity of video models to generate unsafe content, containing crime, offensive activities, violence, or misinformation, which could hinder adoption in sensitive applications.\nDespite the importance of safety, only a few papers\n[\n119\n]\nhave explored methods for improving the safety of video models.\nAddressing this challenge is essential to driving broader applications in robotics.\nFuture Directions.\nEnforcing the safety of video models is particularly challenging, given the broad diversity of unsafe video content. For tractability, prior work has utilized model guardrails to prevent the generation of potentially harmful content. While there is extensive literature on safeguarding LLMs\n[\n278\n]\n, analogous techniques for video generation models are far less developed. Recent work (e.g., SAFEWatch\n[\n52\n]\n) introduces a mechanism for enforcing user-specified safety policies during video generation. However, these methods are task-specific which limits their amenability to more general applications, underscoring the need for more versatile safety guardrails.\nAdditionally, there is a growing need for safety benchmarks for video models.\nExisting benchmarks\n[\n52\n,\n53\n]\nevaluate video models on a limited range of criteria, e.g., crimes, hate content, privacy violations, and abusive content; however, a broader evaluation of safety is required for real-world use-cases in robotics. Developing more effective safety guardrails and introducing more comprehensive safety benchmarks will be critical to improving the overall safety of video models in video synthesis.\n5.6\nSafe Robot Interaction\nBeyond safe video synthesis, robots must interact safely with other objects and agents in their environments. Safety in robotics can be broadly classified into two categories: (i) physical safety, which involves avoiding all forms of collisions; and (ii) semantic safety, which involves avoiding situations deemed potentially harmful by common-sense knowledge, such as tossing sharp objects at other agents. These forms of safety have been underexplored in robotics applications of video models. However, the success of many robotics tasks depends significantly on satisfying these safety constraints, e.g., in visual planning.\nFuture Directions.\nAs embodied world models, video models enable robots to assess the safety of proposed actions without executing these actions in the real-world, which is critical to preserving the safety of robots, other agents, and their environments.\nTo detect safety violations, some existing methods\n[\n30\n]\ngenerate video predictions from robot action proposals using video models.\nOther prior work\n[\n279\n,\n120\n]\nperform robot safety filtering directly in the latent space of world models to predict failures and preempt their occurrence. Likewise, existing methods\n[\n121\n,\n280\n]\nquantify uncertainty in the latent space to guard against unseen out-of-distribution (OOD) hazards and other user-specified constraint violations. While these works make notable steps toward safe robot control, they have primarily been limited to Markovian state-based world models. Extending these ideas to the spatiotemporal latent spaces of video world models remains a challenge, constituting a important direction for future research.\nMoreover, generalization beyond the training distribution remains a core challenge in long-tail or safety-critical scenarios because world models are inherently limited by the distribution of their training data.\n5.7\nAction Estimation\nSOTA imitation-learned robot policies require high-quality data\n[\n281\n,\n209\n,\n282\n]\n, which is often expensive to collect in the real-world. Although video generation models can address this challenge, the video generated by these models typically do not contain action-labeled frames, which is essential in learning robot policies.\nSome methods have explored estimating robot actions from videos; however, these methods\n[\n122\n]\ntypically fail to achieve the high level of accuracy required in imitation learning in fine-grained tasks, hindering the effectiveness of current solutions that integrate video models in policy learning frameworks. We discuss a few limitations of latent action models and inverse-dynamics models, the two main approaches for action estimation from robot videos.\nLatent action models\n[\n122\n,\n123\n]\nestimate robot actions between a pair of video frames in a (discrete) latent space, defined by a fixed set of action codes (primitives). The expressiveness of the learned latent actions is strongly influenced by the size of the latent codebook. Scaling the size of the latent codebook is challenging in practice due to the significant training instabilities and higher compute cost associated with training latent action models with larger codebooks. Further, latent actions are generally difficult to interpret, which makes data curation and analysis more challenging. Additional real-world data is also required to fine-tune latent action models to predict actions that are compatible with physical robots.\nInverse-dynamics models\n[\n124\n,\n125\n]\nsuffer from similar challenges and require lots of training data to sufficiently cover the space of robot actions. Like other imitation-learned models, inverse-dynamics models exhibit limited generalization outside of the training distribution, hindering real-world applications.\nFuture Directions.\nFor better interpretability, recent work\n[\n8\n]\nutilizes small latent codebooks, which facilitate mapping each latent action to interpretable conditioning inputs. However, this approach fails to scale to more complex robotics tasks which require larger codebooks to effectively learn latent actions.\nExploring model architectures that induce interpretable latent actions, without compromising the expressiveness of the latent action space, will be critical to advancing the adoption of video models in robot policy learning. Likewise, the development of robust training procedures for latent action models will be essential to their generalization in robotics.\nAdditionally, semi-supervised training techniques could enable efficient training of generalizable inverse-dynamics models with only a few human annotations, constituting a promising area for future work.\n5.8\nLong Video Generation\nTo serve as effective world models in robotics tasks, video models must predict sufficiently long future horizons that match the duration of robotic tasks, which are often minutes long.\nHowever, SOTA video models are limited to generating videos of only a few seconds in duration. For example, Veo 3.1\n[\n9\n]\ngenerates 8-second long videos while Wan 2.5\n[\n10\n]\ngenerates 10-second long videos. These durations are not long enough for informed decision-making in many robotics problems, such as visual planning. Current video generation pipelines require extending multiple short clips to create longer-duration videos; however, this approach often introduces artifacts that degrade the temporal coherence and physical consistency of the resulting videos.\nWhile SOTA video models excel in short-duration video generation tasks, scaling these models to longer horizons for robotics tasks remains an open challenge.\nFuture Directions.\nSeveral architectures attempt to address video consistency over long horizons. Broadly, these methods use frame compression, sampling schedule optimizations, or hierarchical frameworks to enable long video generation. For example, MALT\n[\n49\n]\nencodes past segments into a compact latent memory vector to facilitate autoregressive generation; however, this approach remains susceptible to error accumulation\n[\n283\n]\n. FramePack\n[\n50\n]\nmitigates drift by compressing frame contexts based on importance and establishing early endpoints to anchor the generation process.\nTTTVideo\n[\n127\n]\nand LaCT\n[\n128\n]\nutilize test-time training (TTT) to dynamically encode history into model weights or neural hidden states during inference. However, the quality of the generated videos degrades as video length increases.\nTo improve video fidelity, Long-Context Tuning (LCT)\n[\n51\n]\nexpands the context window to maintain dense attention across multi-shot scenes but is limited by the quadratic cost of self-attention, which imposes a computational ceiling on the maximum generation length. In contrast to these approaches, Mixture of Contexts (MoC)\n[\n284\n]\ncircumvents compressing history entirely by recasting generation as an information retrieval task via a sparse attention routing mechanism.\nDiffusion Forcing\n[\n126\n]\noffers an alternative solution by training models to denoise tokens with independent noise levels, enabling variable-horizon generation that empirically improves stability in policy rollouts. On the other hand, NUWA-XL\n[\n285\n]\nutilizes a hierarchical “diffusion-over-diffusion” structure, where a global model generates sparse keyframes and local models recursively fill the intermediate gaps.\nDespite these improvements, existing methods still struggle to generate minutes-long videos, impeding the their effectiveness in real-world applications. A promising direction for future work will be to design efficient techniques for extending the memory (context window) of video models without a prohibitive increase in the computation cost to enable high-fidelity long-video generation.\n5.9\nData Curation Costs\nHigh-quality data is essential to training video models that are capable of synthesizing high-fidelity, physically-consistent videos across diverse tasks. Beyond video quality, diversity of the training data strongly influences the fidelity of generated videos\n[\n136\n,\n129\n]\n, especially for text-conditioned or action-conditioned video models, which require extensive data coverage for desirable results.\nAlthough large volumes of videos exist on the internet, many of these videos lack good visual quality and descriptive text annotations, posing a challenge.\nSpecifically, many existing datasets, such as WebVideo-10M\n[\n286\n]\nand Panda-70M\n[\n130\n]\n, have focused on scale rather than quality, aggregating tens of millions of videos along with their captions. As a result, these datasets suffer from inaccurate, non-descriptive video captions, blurry videos, and rapid shot changes between temporally-inconsistent clips, which negatively impact training.\nSOTA methods\n[\n136\n,\n11\n,\n129\n,\n10\n]\ntypically rely on expensive data preprocessing pipelines to identify good-quality video data for training. This pipeline consists of three broad stages: (i) video splitting, (ii) video filtering, and (iii) video annotation. At the video splitting stage, candidate video data is temporally segmented into short continuous clips using classical shot detection tools. Videos that are too short are removed at this stage. The resulting clips are then processed by video filters using metrics that assess the visual quality, text quality, motion smoothness and jitter, among others, often with learned models.\nSubsequently, many methods\n[\n136\n,\n11\n]\nutilize VLMs\n[\n287\n,\n288\n,\n130\n]\nfor annotating the processed videos, pairing text descriptions with the video data for supervising video models. The VLMs are typically fine-tuned for higher-quality video captioning.\nThese processes often require human supervision for evaluation, increasing the cost of data curation.\nFuture Directions.\nRecent video datasets, e.g., VidGen-1M\n[\n131\n]\nand OpenVid-1M\n[\n132\n]\n, have explored different pre-processing techniques to filter videos using well-defined quality scores before training. These quality scores evaluate the aesthetics, temporal consistency, motion fidelity, and caption descriptiveness, identifying video clips that are more likely to be natural without unrealistic motion. Although these datasets generally provide higher-quality training data, their relatively small size impedes strong zero-shot generalization.\nConsequently, many SOTA video models\n[\n10\n,\n11\n,\n9\n]\nutilize proprietary curated datasets with dense annotations by VLMs and humans to ensure high quality control.\nHowever, VLMs are prone to hallucinations, and human-annotated data collection is expensive, posing significant challenges in high-fidelity video data collection. Exploring strategies for grounding VLMs to minimize the risk of hallucinations is a promising area for future work. Likewise, developing novel-view synthesis techniques to efficiently scale data collection to new scenes from a small set of high-quality videos will be essential to reducing the costs of data curation. Further, more accurate methods for splitting and filtering videos will be critical to curating highly diverse datasets with good temporal and spatial consistency, e.g.,\n[\n133\n]\n.\nIn robotics, high-fidelity future prediction in both successful and unsuccessful task rollout or demonstrations is essential for video models to serve as good proxies for real-world environments. Notably, failure demonstrations are important to train video models that faithfully execute actions output by the policy. Recent studies suggest that incorporating failure data from autonomous policy rollouts is critical for training world models that exhibit action controllability\n[\n29\n,\n93\n,\n92\n]\n. In the absence of such data, generated videos can exhibit an optimistic bias toward success, with hallucinations that reposition objects for easier grasping, over-estimate the feasibility of a grasp, and insufficiently model obstructions, all of which would cause real executions to fail\n[\n29\n]\n.\n5.10\nTraining and Inference Costs\nSOTA video models require large amounts of compute resources for training and inference.\nAlthough the true cost of training video models is often confidential especially for closed-source models, the most cost-effective SOTA open-source video models require hundreds of thousands of dollars to train—e.g., $200k for Open-Sora 2.0\n[\n136\n]\n.\nVideo models typically have billions of parameters, which is a major contributing factor to their significant training costs.\nAlthough latent diffusion\n[\n135\n]\nreduces the number of parameters required by these models, the corresponding reduction in training costs is often not sufficient. As a result, research on training video models has broadly remained limited to large research groups with deep budgets. Moreover, recent developments such as classifier-free guidance\n[\n174\n,\n169\n]\nfor fine-grained input-conditioning introduce additional computational overhead. Reducing training and inference costs is critical to advancing broader applications of video models in robotics.\nAdditionally, high-fidelity video models\n[\n10\n,\n11\n,\n7\n,\n9\n]\nare often limited by significantly slow inference speeds.\nFor example, Veo 3\n[\n9\n]\ngenerates about\n12\n12\nvideo frames per second on an NVIDIA A100 GPU. Although sufficient in some use cases, the slow inference time presents an important challenge in many robotics applications, such as visual planning, where closed-loop execution requires real-time feedback to the planner for robustness.\nExisting video model planners often take a few seconds to generate feasible action trajectories for a single episode\n[\n134\n]\n, which is not fast enough for real-time operation.\nFuture Directions.\nFor faster training and inference, recent work\n[\n136\n,\n31\n]\nhas explored spatial and temporal compression techniques to reduce the number of costly attention operations during video generation.\nDreamer 4\n[\n31\n]\napplies temporal attention sparsely to every fourth video frame by decoupling spatial and temporal attention. Similarly, OpenSora uses deep compression autoencoders\n[\n289\n]\nto downsample input tokens at greater ratios to speed up inference by an order of magnitude. Likewise, Wan\n[\n10\n]\nemploys a feature cache mechanism to enable chunk-based video synthesis while preserving temporal continuity.\nSome other methods utilize shortcut models\n[\n137\n]\nfor finer control over the number of sampling steps required for video generation without any significant degradation in video quality.\nLike shortcut models, consistency models\n[\n138\n,\n290\n]\nenable efficient video diffusion using a single-step denoising process.\nOther video models utilize more classical speed optimization techniques for faster inference, e.g., quantization\n[\n291\n]\nand model distillation\n[\n292\n]\n.\nFurther research on these topics is required to improve inference speeds for real-time applications.\n6\nConclusion\nThis survey reviews video models and their applications as embodied world models in robotics, identifying prevailing model architectures, conditioning modalities, and key capabilities of video models. Specifically, we categorize existing robotics applications into four broad classes: robot data generation and action prediction in imitation learning, dynamics and rewards modeling in reinforcement learning, policy evaluation, and visual planning.\nWe emphasize that these applications are underpinned by the remarkable ability of video models to learn fine-grained spatiotemporal relationships that govern the evolution of the state of real-world environments, which is essential for physically consistent future predictions.\nFurthermore, we identify critical open research challenges and propose directions for future research, seeking to motivate broader applications of video models.\nAcknowledgments\nAsher J.

    "preview_text": "Video generation models have emerged as high-fidelity models of the physical world, capable of synthesizing high-quality videos capturing fine-grained interactions between agents and their environments conditioned on multi-modal user inputs. Their impressive capabilities address many of the long-standing challenges faced by physics-based simulators, driving broad adoption in many problem domains, e.g., robotics. For example, video models enable photorealistic, physically consistent deformable-body simulation without making prohibitive simplifying assumptions, which is a major bottleneck in physics-based simulation. Moreover, video models can serve as foundation world models that capture the dynamics of the world in a fine-grained and expressive way. They thus overcome the limited expressiveness of language-only abstractions in describing intricate physical interactions. In this survey, we provide a review of video models and their applications as embodied world models in robotics, encompassing cost-effective data generation and action prediction in imitation learning, dynamics and rewards modeling in reinforcement learning, visual planning, and policy evaluation. Further, we highlight important challenges hindering the trustworthy integration of video models in robotics, which include poor instruction following, hallucinations such as violations of physics, and unsafe content generation, in addition to fundamental limitations such as significant data curation, training, and inference costs. We present potential future directions to address these open research challenges to motivate research and ultimately facilitate broader applications, especially in safety-critical settings.\n\n1]Princeton University\n2]Temple University\n\\contribution\n[*]Equal contribution.\nVideo Generation Models in Robotics:\nApplications, Research Challenges, Future Directions\nZhiting Mei\nTenny Yin\nOla Shorinwa\nApurva Badithela\nZhonghe Zheng\nJoseph Bruno\nMadison Bland\nLihan Zha\nAsher Hancock\nJaime ",

            "answer": "好的，作为一名专业的学术论文分析助手，我将根据您提供的论文内容，对其中涉及的评价指标与数据集进行详细分析。\n\n## 论文评价指标与数据集分析\n\n这篇题为《Video Generation Models in Robotics: Applications, Research Challenges, Future Directions》的综述性论文，系统性地回顾了视频生成模型在机器人领域的应用、挑战与未来方向。论文本身并未提出新的指标或数据集，而是对现有研究中的**评价指标**和**基准测试（Benchmarks）** 进行了梳理和总结。其核心价值在于提供了一个全面的分类框架和批判性分析。\n\n以下是根据论文内容整理的指标与基准测试详情：\n\n### 一、 评价指标（Metrics）\n\n论文将评价指标分为两大类：**帧级指标**和**时空一致性指标**。此外，还强调了**面向应用的指标**的重要性。\n\n#### 1. 帧级指标（Frame-level Metrics）\n这些指标评估单个视频帧的视觉质量。\n\n| 指标名称 | 缩写 | 核心原理 | 优点 | 缺点/局限性 | 在机器人领域的适用性 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **峰值信噪比** | PSNR | 计算生成帧与真实帧像素值之间的均方误差（MSE），再转化为对数尺度。值越高，失真越小。 | 计算简单，有明确的物理意义（信号与噪声的功率比）。 | **与人类感知相关性弱**。对像素的微小偏移非常敏感，即使视觉上无差异，PSNR也可能很低。无法评估高级语义。 | **较低**。机器人任务更关注高级语义和物理一致性，而非像素级精确匹配。 |\n| **结构相似性指数** | SSIM | 从**亮度**、**对比度**、**结构**三个维度比较两幅图像，更符合人眼视觉系统。 | 比PSNR更贴近人类主观感受，能捕捉图像的结构信息。 | 仍然是**全参考**指标，需要真实帧作为对比。对某些类型的失真（如模糊）可能不敏感。 | **中等**。可用于评估生成画面的逼真度，但不足以衡量物理正确性或任务完成度。 |\n| **CLIP相似度得分** | CLIP Score | 使用CLIP模型将图像编码为特征向量，计算生成帧与目标描述（文本）或参考帧（图像）在特征空间的余弦相似度。 | **无需成对的真实帧**，可以评估语义对齐。与人类对语义一致性的判断相关性高。 | 依赖于CLIP模型本身的能力和偏见。可能无法捕捉细粒度的物理细节。 | **高**。非常适合评估生成内容是否与语言指令（如“将蓝色积木放在红色积木上”）在语义上对齐。 |\n| **Fréchet Inception距离** | FID | 计算真实图像集和生成图像集在Inception-v3网络中间层特征空间中的两个多元高斯分布之间的Fréchet距离（Wasserstein-2距离）。 | **无参考**，评估整体分布质量。同时衡量**生成质量**（逼真度）和**多样性**。 | 需要足够多的样本以稳定估计分布。对计算资源要求较高。Inception-v3的特征空间可能不适用于所有领域。 | **中等偏高**。可用于评估生成机器人演示数据的整体质量和多样性，但无法评估动态过程。 |\n| **学习感知图像块相似度** | LPIPS | 使用预训练的深度网络（如AlexNet、VGG）提取多层级特征，计算特征空间中的距离。距离越小，感知越相似。 | 被证明与人类感知判断高度相关，能有效评估纹理、风格等高级特征差异。 | 是**全参考**指标。依赖于所选网络架构。 | **中等**。可用于评估生成画面的感知质量，但非机器人任务的核心。 |\n\n#### 2. 时空一致性指标（Spatiotemporal Metrics）\n这些指标评估视频在时间维度上的连贯性和动态质量。\n\n| 指标名称 | 缩写 | 核心原理 | 优点 | 缺点/局限性 | 在机器人领域的适用性 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Fréchet 视频距离** | FVD | **FID在视频域的扩展**。使用专为视频分类设计的I3D网络提取**时空特征**，然后计算真实视频集与生成视频集特征分布之间的Fréchet距离。 | 专门为视频设计，能同时评估**视觉质量**和**时间动态**。是当前视频生成领域的**黄金标准**之一。 | 计算成本高。需要大量视频样本。I3D网络在非动作识别任务上的特征代表性可能有限。 | **高**。是评估作为世界模型的视频生成质量的关键指标，能反映动态预测的逼真度。 |\n| **核视频距离** | KVD | 与FVD目标相同，但使用**最大均值差异**（MMD）而非Fréchet距离来比较特征分布。MMD不假设特征服从高斯分布。 | 对特征分布的假设更弱，可能更鲁棒。 | 计算复杂度可能更高，且在实践中FVD更主流。 | **中等**。是FVD的一种替代方案，但应用和验证相对较少。 |\n| **Fréchet 视频运动距离** | FVMD | 专注于评估**运动质量**。首先从视频中提取可跟踪的关键点，计算其速度和加速度等运动特征，然后计算这些运动特征分布之间的Fréchet距离。 | 直接量化**运动**的逼真度和自然度，与视觉内容解耦。 | 依赖关键点检测与跟踪的准确性，在复杂场景或遮挡下可能失效。 | **高**。对于机器人任务至关重要，因为物理上合理的运动是规划和控制的基础。 |\n| **光流一致性** | Optical Flow Consistency | 比较连续生成帧之间预测的光流场与从生成帧中实际计算出的光流场之间的差异。 | 直接测量生成视频的**时间平滑性**和**运动一致性**。 | 只是一个中间指标，高光流一致性不一定代表物理正确。 | **中等**。是保证视频不出现闪烁、抖动等低级瑕疵的必要条件，但非充分条件。 |\n\n#### 3. 面向应用的指标（Application-focused Metrics）\n论文特别强调，在机器人学中，下游任务的表现才是最终检验标准。\n\n| 指标类型 | 具体示例 | 说明 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **策略评估指标** | **皮尔逊相关系数**、**平均最大秩违例** | 比较视频模型预测的策略成功率与真实世界实验成功率之间的相关性（皮尔逊系数）。MMRV则量化策略排名预测错误的严重程度。**这是衡量视频模型能否作为可靠仿真器的核心指标。** |\n| **策略学习指标** | **最终任务成功率**、**数据生成有效性** | 使用视频模型生成的数据训练出的机器人策略，在真实世界或标准测试环境中的表现。例如，DreamGen等工作通过对比使用生成数据与真实数据训练的策略性能来评估视频模型。 |\n| **物理常识指标** | **VLM判分**、**专用物理问答** | 使用大型视觉语言模型（如GPT-4V）作为“裁判”，判断生成视频是否违反物理定律（如物体穿透、违反重力）。或构建专门的物理常识问答对进行评估。 |\n\n### 二、 基准测试与数据集（Benchmarks & Datasets）\n\n论文区分了用于**训练**视频模型的大规模互联网数据集和用于**评估**其各方面能力的基准测试。\n\n#### 1. 训练数据集（Training Datasets）\n这些数据集规模巨大，但质量参差不齐，需要复杂的清洗流程。\n\n| 数据集名称 | 规模 | 特点与用途 | 局限性（论文指出） |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **WebVideo-10M** | 1000万视频-文本对 | 早期大规模网络视频数据集，用于训练文本-视频检索和生成模型。 | 侧重**规模**而非**质量**。字幕不准确、视频模糊、镜头切换频繁，导致训练信号嘈杂。 |\n| **Panda-70M** | 7000万视频-文本对 | 更大规模的网络视频数据集，使用多模态教师模型（VLMs）自动生成描述。 | 尽管使用了VLM标注，但**VLM本身会产生幻觉**，导致标注噪声。视频质量过滤仍是挑战。 |\n| **VidGen-1M / OpenVid-1M** | 约100万视频 | 较新的数据集，强调通过严格的预处理（美学评分、运动平滑度、字幕描述性）来保证**高质量**。 | **规模相对较小**，可能限制模型的零样本泛化能力。高质量标注依赖人工或更可靠的VLM，成本高。 |\n| **专有数据集** (如用于训练Veo, Wan, Cosmos) | 未公开，推测数亿至上亿 | SOTA闭源模型（如OpenAI的Veo、Google的Wan）使用的数据集。通常结合了**自动化过滤**和**人工标注**，具有极高的质量和密集的注释。 | **不公开**，阻碍了开源研究。构建成本极其高昂（数据清洗、VLM标注、人工审核）。 |\n\n**论文强调的核心挑战**：高质量数据集的构建需要昂贵的“**视频分割 -> 视频过滤 ->",
