Menzel\na.menzel@ovgu.de\nInstitut für Physik,\nOtto-von-Guericke-Universität Magdeburg, Universitätsplatz 2, 39106 Magdeburg, Germany\n(January 12, 2026)\nAbstract\nWhen swimming at low Reynolds numbers, inertial effects are negligible and reciprocal movements cannot induce net motion.\nInstead, symmetry breaking is necessary to achieve net propulsion. Directed swimming can be supported by magnetic fields, which simultaneously provide a versatile means of remote actuation.\nThus, we analyze the motion of a straight microswimmer composed of three magnetizable beads connected by two elastic links. The swimming mechanism is based on oriented external magnetic fields that oscillate in magnitude. Through induced reversible hysteretic collapse of the two segments of the swimmer, the two pairs of beads jump into contact and separate nonreciprocally.\nDue to higher-order hydrodynamic interactions, net displacement results after each cycle. Different microswimmers can be tuned to different driving amplitudes and frequencies, allowing for simultaneous independent control by just one external magnetic field.\nThe swimmer geometry and magnetic field shape are optimized for maximum swimming speed using an evolutionary optimization strategy.\nThanks to the simple working principle, an experimental realization of such a microrobot seems feasible and may open new approaches for microinvasive medical interventions such as targeted drug delivery.\nmicrorobot, microswimmer, soft robotics, magnetic remote actuation, Stokes flow, targeted drug delivery\nI\nIntroduction\nThe field of microrobotics promises significant advances in biomedicine, because it allows microinvasive interventions, such as targeted drug or cell delivery\n[\n23\n,\n31\n]\n. Such microscopic robots could further be used for micromanipulation and targeted removal of toxic substances in the environment\n[\n40\n]\n.\nDespite the benefits of the small length scales of microrobots on the order of micrometers, these scales also impose restrictions on design and mode of operation.\nHere, we mostly address the central challenges of actuation and swimming at low Reynolds numbers along a requested direction.\nAs it becomes very difficult to equip such small robots with on-board power devices, and since potential fuel usually cannot be distributed in their environment in medical applications, most microrobots resort to remote actuation. Besides visible light\n[\n32\n]\nand ultrasound\n[\n39\n]\n, magnetic fields are a popular choice\n[\n41\n]\n. They can induce magnetic moments in magnetizable materials and exert torques by aligning them with the direction of the magnetic field. Moreover, net forces can be achieved through magnetic field gradients.\nYet, this external actuation, at first glance, poses challenges on the construction of a microrobot. All magnetizable components of the microswimmer (in our case three magnetizable beads) are addressed simultaneously by the external field. So how can we achieve control over the different internal degrees of freedom to achieve required non-simultaneous patterns of motion, although they share the same actuation channel via the magnetic field?\nMoreover, it appears difficult to steer individual microswimmers separately when multiple of them are present in one external magnetic field.\nGenerally, swimming at low Reynolds numbers differs from our daily experience at macroscopic scales. In Stokes flow at small length scales, viscous forces dominate and fluid inertia is negligible, causing flows to be time-reversible.\nA sequence of shape changes that is identical when played forward and backward, known as reciprocal motion, therefore does not generate time asymmetry, even if performed at different speed. As a result, the net displacement after a full reciprocal cycle is zero\n[\n37\n]\n.\nEffective propulsion in such environments requires non-reciprocal deformation that breaks time-reversal symmetry. One single linear degree of freedom is insufficient, because any cyclical motion is reciprocal in that case.\nDesigning microswimmers is thus an act of balance between simplicity, to facilitate fabrication and operation, and complexity, to achieve nonreciprocal motion or otherwise break forward–backward symmetry.\nNature has evolved various strategies to achieve this, including rotating helical flagella, snake-like undulations, or shape morphing\n[\n13\n]\n. Some of them can be mimicked in artificial microswimmers\n[\n3\n,\n44\n]\n.\nA minimal model microswimmer that can achieve net propulsion at low Reynolds numbers is the three-sphere swimmer introduced by Najafi and Golestanian\n[\n30\n]\n. It consists of three collinearly arranged spheres connected by two arms of variable length.\nBy changing the lengths of the two arms in a non-reciprocal manner, net motion is achieved. This model has been studied extensively\n[\n30\n,\n16\n,\n29\n,\n1\n,\n33\n,\n5\n,\n10\n,\n9\n]\n.\nAlthough this linear arrangement lends itself to analytical treatment and is easy to visualize, its practical realization remains a challenge. Previous experimental attempts have involved optical tweezers to replicate the movement pattern\n[\n29\n]\n, which is however impractical for in vivo applications.\nThe implementation of a self-assembled microswimmer has been achieved relying on capillary forces at fluid interfaces combined with periodic magnetic actuation\n[\n17\n]\n. Yet, it seems that involving the role of fluid surfaces may limit applications inside biological systems. Symmetry breaking was achieved by using spheres of different sizes while tuning the actuation frequency accordingly, and the listed model equations involve inertial effects.\nIn the following, we propose a different approach, still based on magnetic actuation. In our analysis, we connect the three magnetizable spheres using two elastic springs. We entirely concentrate on the overdamped regime, which generally renders nonreciprocality a challenge.\nTo succeed, we focus on an effect investigated earlier in theory and experiments. It refers to the reversible collapse and reseparation of pairs of elastically linked beads, which can be induced magnetically\n[\n2\n,\n6\n,\n7\n,\n35\n,\n15\n]\n.\nThe hysteretic nature of this phenomenon allows the collapse and reseparation to occur at different field strengths, thus breaking time-reversal symmetry.\nFirst, we analytically analyze the hysteretic behavior of the collapse of two spheres linked by a finitely extensible spring in Sec.\nII\n.\nThen, we introduce the complete three-sphere swimmer and find conditions for nonreciprocal motion, see Sec.\nIII\n.\nWe proceed by analyzing hydrodynamic interactions in Sec.\nIV\nand provide a geometric illustration for how the loop in the configuration space leads to net propulsion.\nUsing an evolutionary strategy algorithm, we optimize the design of the microrobot and the driving magnetic field to achieve maximum speed in Sec.\nV\n.\nFinally, we conclude in Sec.\nVI\nwith brief ideas on potential implementations and improvements in design.\nII\nHysteretic reversible magnetically induced collapse\nWe start by an analytical consideration of the hysteretic collapse and reseparation of two magnetized spheres linked by a finitely extensible spring shown in\nFig.\n1\n.\nFigure 1:\nTwo magnetic spheres (red) linked by a finitely extensible spring (silver-blue). The top snapshot shows the nonmagnetized configuration with the spring in its undeformed state. In the bottom constellation, a magnetic field is applied along the axis connecting the centers of the two spheres. It induces the magnetic moments\n𝒎\n\\boldsymbol{m}\n(green arrows) in the spheres, leading to an attractive magnetic force, which contracts the spring. Due to the finite extensibility of the spring, the spheres cannot be brought arbitrarily close together.\nThe spheres of radius\na\na\nconsist of a superparamagnetic material with high magnetic susceptibility\nχ\n≫\n1\n\\chi\\gg 1\n.\nWhen applying a homogeneous external magnetic field\n𝑯\n=\nH\n​\n𝒙\n^\n\\boldsymbol{H}=H\\boldsymbol{\\hat{x}}\nin the\nx\nx\n-direction, each sphere develops a magnetic dipole moment\n𝒎\n=\nχ\na\n​\nV\n​\n𝑯\n\\boldsymbol{m}=\\chi_{a}V\\boldsymbol{H}\n, where\nV\n=\n4\n​\nπ\n​\na\n3\n/\n3\nV=4\\pi a^{3}/3\nis the volume of the sphere. We hereby neglect mutual magnetizing effects among the spheres. That is, we assume that their separations are sufficiently large, and/or the external magnetic field is sufficiently strong to magnetize the spheres towards saturation.\nThe apparent susceptibility\nχ\na\n=\nχ\n/\n(\n1\n+\nN\n​\nχ\n)\n\\chi_{a}=\\chi/(1+N\\chi)\nis reduced due to demagnetization, with a demagnetizing factor\nN\n=\n1\n/\n3\nN=1/3\nfor spheres. Thus, the attractive dipole–dipole interaction between the two spheres can be described by the potential\nU\nmag\n=\n−\n8\n​\nπ\n9\n​\nχ\na\n2\n​\nμ\n0\n​\na\n6\n​\nH\n2\nx\n3\n,\nU_{\\text{mag}}=-\\frac{8\\pi}{9}\\chi_{a}^{2}\\mu_{0}a^{6}\\frac{H^{2}}{x^{3}},\n(1)\nwhere\nx\nx\nis the center-to-center distance between the spheres and\nμ\n0\n\\mu_{0}\nis the vacuum permeability.\nTo counterbalance this attraction, the spheres are connected by a finitely extensible nonlinear elastic spring (FENE)\n[\n42\n]\nof rest length\nℓ\n\\ell\nin the undeformed state, maximum change in length\nℓ\nmax\n\\ell_{\\text{max}}\nunder extension or compression, and stiffness\nk\nk\n, with the spring potential\nU\nFENE\n=\n−\n1\n2\n​\nk\n​\nℓ\nmax\n2\n​\nln\n⁡\n[\n1\n−\n(\nx\n−\nℓ\n)\n2\nℓ\nmax\n2\n]\n.\nU_{\\text{FENE}}=-\\frac{1}{2}k\\ell_{\\text{max}}^{2}\\ln\\left[1-\\frac{(x-\\ell)^{2}}{\\ell_{\\text{max}}^{2}}\\right].\n(2)\nDimensional analysis shows that the relevant dimensionless parameters are the extensibility\nϵ\n=\nℓ\nmax\n/\nℓ\n\\epsilon={\\ell_{\\text{max}}}/{\\ell}\nof the spring and the rescaled magnetic field strength\nβ\n=\nH\n​\n8\n​\nπ\n​\nχ\na\n2\n​\nμ\n0\n​\na\n6\n/\n3\n​\nk\n​\nℓ\n5\n\\beta=H\\sqrt{{8\\pi\\chi_{a}^{2}\\mu_{0}a^{6}}/{3k\\ell^{5}}}\n.\nAll lengths can be scaled by\nℓ\n\\ell\nand energies by\nk\n​\nℓ\n2\nk\\ell^{2}\n. The total rescaled potential for two spheres as a function of the relative separation\nr\n=\nx\n/\nℓ\nr=x/\\ell\nthen reads\nU\n2\n=\n−\nϵ\n2\n2\n​\nln\n⁡\n(\n1\n−\n(\nr\n−\n1\n)\n2\nϵ\n2\n)\n−\n1\n3\n​\nβ\n2\nr\n3\n.\nU_{2}=-\\frac{\\epsilon^{2}}{2}\\ln\\left(1-\\frac{(r-1)^{2}}{\\epsilon^{2}}\\right)-\\frac{1}{3}\\frac{\\beta^{2}}{r^{3}}.\n(3)\nFor small values of\nβ\n\\beta\n, the spring potential dominates, and there is a single stable equilibrium position close to the rest length\nℓ\n\\ell\n.\nWhile increasing\nβ\n\\beta\n, a second local minimum appears in a saddle-node bifurcation at small separations due to magnetic attraction. When the field strength is increased further, the first minimum disappears in another saddle-node bifurcation, and only the collapsed state remains stable.\nThis behavior is illustrated in\nFig.\n2\n.\nFigure 2:\n(a) Two magnetizable spheres are subject to the dimensionless potential\nU\n2\nU_{2}\n, see\nEq.\n3\n, when linked by a FENE spring and exposed to an external magnetic field of rescaled strength\nβ\n\\beta\n.\nr\nr\ndenotes the rescaled center-to-center distance between the spheres.\nThe extensibility of the spring is set to\nϵ\n=\n0.75\n\\epsilon=0.75\n.\nWhen the magnetic field strength\nβ\n\\beta\nis varied, different local minima (circles) appear.\nFor\nβ\n=\n0.15\n\\beta=0.15\n(blue), there is only one stable configuration close to the rest length of the spring,\nr\n≈\n1\nr\\approx 1\n. When increasing\nβ\n\\beta\nto\n0.25\n0.25\n(green), the minimum moves slightly to the left and a second minimum appears in a compressed state of the spring,\nr\n≈\n0.25\nr\\approx 0.25\n,\ndue to the induced magnetic attraction.\nFor\nβ\n=\n0.3\n\\beta=0.3\n(orange), the magnetic attraction dominates, leading to the disappearance of the minimum on the right so that the compressed state is the only stable minimum.\n(b) Bifurcation diagram for this configuration in the plane spanned by the rescaled length of the spring\nr\nr\nand the rescaled magnitude of the external magnetic field\nβ\n\\beta\n, see\nEq.\n12\n.\n1. When the magnetic field is increased, the stable equilibrium position (solid purple line) moves to smaller lengths\nr\nr\nof the spring, until the solution vanishes in a saddle-node bifurcation (red triangle). 2. From there, the spheres collapse to a compressed state of the spring.\n3. When the field is decreased again, the spheres remain in the collapsed state for magnetic field amplitudes\nβ\n\\beta\nlower than those of the previous event of collapse, implying hysteresis. 4. Finally, another saddle-node bifurcation appears, and the spheres abruptly detach and reseparate.\nAt intermediate field strengths\nβ\n\\beta\n, between both saddle-node bifurcations, two stable equilibria coexist, separated by an unstable solution (dashed purple line).\nThe three different field strengths\nβ\n\\beta\nin (a) are marked by horizontal, dotted, colored lines. Corresponding minima in the potential in (a) are indicated by circled, colored dots.\nThe points of bifurcation depend only on the extensibility\nϵ\n\\epsilon\nof the spring and are given as the roots of a cubic polynomial, see Appendix\nA\n.\nBifurcations only appear above a critical extensibility\nϵ\n=\n1\n/\n3\n\\epsilon={1}/{\\sqrt{3}}\n. The magnitude of the collapse increases with increasing extensibility\nϵ\n\\epsilon\nand the two bifurcations move further apart from each other both in space\nr\nr\nand in field strength\nβ\n\\beta\n. The dependence of the bifurcation points on extensibility\nϵ\n\\epsilon\nis illustrated in\nFig.\n3\n.\nFigure 3:\n(a) Location of the bifurcations depending on the extensibility\nϵ\n=\nℓ\nmax\n/\nℓ\n\\epsilon=\\ell_{\\text{max}}/\\ell\n.\nWith increasing extensibility, the two bifurcation values of the distance\nr\nr\nbetween the centers of the spheres corresponding to collapse (blue dash-dotted line) and detaching (green dashed line) further separate.\nThe detaching position has the asymptotic behavior of\nr\n=\nx\n/\nℓ\n=\n4\n​\n(\n1\n−\nϵ\n)\n/\n3\nr=x/\\ell=4(1-\\epsilon)/3\n(gray dotted line) when the extensibility approaches unity.\nAt\nϵ\n=\n1\n/\n3\n≈\n0.6\n\\epsilon=1/\\sqrt{3}\\approx 0.6\n, both curves corresponding to saddle-node bifurcations merge into a cusp bifurcation. Below this critical value of the extensibility, no bifurcations occur.\nIn (b) the magnetic field strengths\nβ\n=\nh\n/\nk\n​\nℓ\n5\n\\beta=h/\\sqrt{k\\ell^{5}}\nat which the bifurcations occur are shown for different extensibilities.\nThe individual bifurcation diagrams for the marked points are shown in (c), together with the curve traced out by all points of bifurcation (green dashed line).\nIII\nNonreciprocal motion of the three-sphere microswimmer\nWe now introduce the full three-sphere microswimmer consisting of three magnetizable beads with radius\na\na\n, connected by FENE springs of rest lengths\nℓ\ni\n\\ell_{i}\n, maximum extensions\nℓ\ni\n,\nmax\n\\ell_{i,\\text{max}}\n, and stiffnesses\nk\ni\nk_{i}\n, where\ni\n∈\n{\n1\n,\n2\n}\ni\\in\\{1,2\\}\n.\nWe assume the springs to be resistant to bending and torsion so that the spheres remain collinearly aligned. The mutual dipolar interaction together with the aligning effect of the external magnetic field support this collinear alignment\n[\n20\n,\n38\n,\n26\n]\n. If the external magnetic field is applied along the\nx\nx\n-direction, the swimmer aligns itself with the field because its overall easy axis of magnetization is along its long axis.\nHence, we only consider motion along the\nx\nx\n-axis in the following.\nThe first spring connects the first two spheres at center locations\nx\n1\nx_{1}\nand\nx\n2\nx_{2}\n, while the second spring connects the second to the third sphere at center locations\nx\n2\nx_{2}\nand\nx\n3\nx_{3}\n. We denote the center-to-center distances as\nx\ni\n​\nj\n=\nx\nj\n−\nx\ni\nx_{ij}=x_{j}-x_{i}\n, where\ni\n=\n1\ni=1\nand\nj\n=\n2\nj=2\nor\ni\n=\n2\ni=2\nand\nj\n=\n3\nj=3\n.\nNext, we rescale all lengths by the radius\na\na\nand the magnetic field as\nh\n=\nH\n/\nH\nmax\nh=H/H_{\\text{max}}\n, where\nH\nmax\nH_{\\text{max}}\ndenotes the maximally attainable magnetic field strength.\nTo simplify the numeric prefactors, we rescale energies by\n8\n​\nπ\n​\nχ\na\n2\n​\nμ\n0\n​\na\n3\n​\nH\nmax\n2\n/\n3\n8\\pi\\chi_{a}^{2}\\mu_{0}a^{3}H_{\\text{max}}^{2}/3\nand the spring constants by\n8\n​\nπ\n​\nχ\na\n2\n​\nμ\n0\n​\na\n​\nH\nmax\n2\n/\n3\n8\\pi\\chi_{a}^{2}\\mu_{0}aH_{\\text{max}}^{2}/3\n.\nIn total, the potential of our three-sphere swimmer is then given by\nU\n3\n\\displaystyle U_{3}\n=\n\\displaystyle=\n−\n1\n2\n​\nk\n1\n​\nℓ\n1\n,\nmax\n2\n​\nln\n⁡\n(\n1\n−\n(\nx\n12\n−\nℓ\n1\n)\n2\nℓ\n1\n,\nmax\n2\n)\n\\displaystyle{}-\\frac{1}{2}{k_{1}\\ell_{1,\\text{max}}^{2}}\\ln\\left(1-\\frac{(x_{12}-\\ell_{1})^{2}}{\\ell_{1,\\text{max}}^{2}}\\right)\n(4)\n−\n1\n2\n​\nk\n2\n​\nℓ\n2\n,\nmax\n2\n​\nln\n⁡\n(\n1\n−\n(\nx\n23\n−\nℓ\n2\n)\n2\nℓ\n2\n,\nmax\n2\n)\n\\displaystyle{}-\\frac{1}{2}{k_{2}\\ell_{2,\\text{max}}^{2}}\\ln\\left(1-\\frac{(x_{23}-\\ell_{2})^{2}}{\\ell_{2,\\text{max}}^{2}}\\right)\n−\nh\n2\n3\n​\n(\n1\nx\n12\n3\n+\n1\nx\n23\n3\n+\n1\n(\nx\n12\n+\nx\n23\n)\n3\n)\n,\n\\displaystyle{}-\\frac{{h^{2}}}{3}\\left(\\frac{{1}}{x_{12}^{3}}+\\frac{1}{x_{23}^{3}}+\\frac{1}{(x_{12}+x_{23})^{3}}\\right),\nwhere all quantities are now dimensionless.\nThe dynamics of\nx\n12\nx_{12}\nand\nx\n23\nx_{23}\nare only loosely connected, because the magnetic coupling term\n−\nh\n2\n/\n[\n3\n​\n(\nx\n12\n+\nx\n23\n)\n3\n]\n-h^{2}/[3(x_{12}+x_{23})^{3}]\nis comparatively small due to the larger distance between the outer spheres. However, the presence of the additional sphere tends to reduce the equilibrium distance between each pair of spheres in a magnetized state and lowers the required field strengths for collapse and detaching. The effect is stronger when the other outer sphere is already in the collapsed state.\nWe now apply a slowly oscillating magnetic field\nh\n​\n(\nt\n)\nh(t)\nthat varies between a minimum magnitude\nh\nmin\nh_{\\text{min}}\nand a maximum magnitude\nh\nmax\n=\n1\nh_{\\text{max}}=1\n, without changing direction.\nDuring one cycle of the magnetic field, both pairs of spheres will undergo hysteretic collapse and detachment at different field strengths.\nThe desired order of those events to achieve nonreciprocal motion and thus net propulsion of our microrobot is as follows.\nStarting from high magnetic field strengths in the collapsed state, when gradually decreasing the magnetic field, one pair of spheres separates first. Then the other pair of spheres separates. This secondary event is supported by the now weaker magnetic attraction towards the already separated outer sphere from the first separation event. When the strength of the magnetic field is increased again, the sequence of reaction is the\nsame\nfor the two pairs. The pair that first separated will also be the first to collapse. Then the other pair follows.\nThe cycle is completed, and the swimmer is again in its initial state.\nWe denote the necessary rescaled magnetic fields for separation and collapse of the pair of spheres\ni\ni\nand\nj\nj\nas\nh\nseparate\n,\ni\n​\nj\nh_{\\text{separate},ij}\nand\nh\ncollapse\n,\ni\n​\nj\nh_{\\text{collapse},ij}\n, respectively.\nFor our purpose, we require\nh\nseparate\n,\n23\n<\nh\nseparate\n,\n12\n≤\nh\ncollapse\n,\n12\n<\nh\ncollapse\n,\n23\n≤\n1\nh_{\\text{separate},23}<h_{\\text{separate},12}\\leq h_{\\text{collapse},12}<h_{\\text{collapse},23}\\leq 1\n.\nIt appears from here that the extensibility of the spring length\nx\n23\nx_{23}\nshould be larger. This promotes a wider gap between the field strengths of separation and collapse.\nIn principle, it is not necessary for the spring length\nx\n12\nx_{12}\nto show any hysteretic behavior at all, as long as the major deformation of this spring occurs between\nh\nseparate\n,\n23\nh_{\\text{separate},23}\nand\nh\ncollapse\n,\n23\nh_{\\text{collapse},23}\n.\nFor the magnetic field to be able to induce the full collapse, we require\nh\ncollapse\n,\ni\n​\nj\n<\n1\nh_{\\text{collapse},{ij}}<1\nand thus\nk\ni\n​\nℓ\ni\n5\n⪅\n81\n/\n8\nk_{i}\\ell_{i}^{5}\\lessapprox 81/8\n, see Appendix\nA\n. We therefore choose to define the swimmer parameters\nc\ni\n=\nk\ni\n​\nℓ\ni\n5\nc_{i}=k_{i}\\ell_{i}^{5}\nfor\ni\n∈\n{\n1\n,\n2\n}\ni\\in\\{1,2\\}\n, which are generally of the order of\n10\n10\n.\nIV\nHydrodynamic interactions and net propulsion\nAt low Reynolds numbers, the motion of the microswimmer is overdamped and governed by Stokesian hydrodynamics. Since the flow equations are linear, they lead to equations of motion for the positions of the spheres of the form\nv\ni\n=\nd\n​\nx\ni\nd\n​\nt\n=\nM\n0\n​\n∑\nj\n=\n1\n3\nM\ni\n​\nj\n​\nF\nj\n,\ni\n=\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n.\nv_{i}=\\frac{dx_{i}}{dt}=M_{0}\\sum_{j=1}^{3}M_{ij}F_{j},\\qquad i=1,2,3.\n(5)\nHere,\nF\nj\n=\n−\n∂\nU\n3\n/\n∂\nx\nj\nF_{j}=-\\partial U_{3}/\\partial x_{j}\nare the forces that act on the spheres due to the potential in Eq. (\n4\n).\nM\ni\n​\nj\nM_{ij}\nare the components of the dimensionless mobility matrix\n𝐌\n\\mathbf{M}\n.

In these units, the mobility of a single sphere becomes\nM\n0\n=\n10\n6\nM_{0}=10^{6}\n.\nWith the help of Faxén’s relations, the mobility matrix can be expanded in terms of the inverse intersphere distances\n1\n/\nx\ni\n​\nj\n1/x_{ij}\nas given in the Appendix\nB\n.\nThe expansion breaks down when the spheres are very close to each other.\nTo avoid this regime, we impose a minimum separation of\n4\n​\na\n4a\nbetween the centers of the spheres. For this purpose, we restrict the maximum deviation from the rest length of the springs by setting\nℓ\ni\n,\nmax\n=\nℓ\ni\n−\n4\n\\ell_{i,\\text{max}}=\\ell_{i}-4\n, so that the FENE potential in\nEq.\n2\ndiverges before the distance between the spheres becomes too small.\nFurthermore, we consider the springs as frictionless.\nPurcell’s scallop theorem\n[\n37\n]\nin our case implies that the net propulsion of the swimmer after one cycle of the magnetic field only depends on the shape of the loop in configuration space\n(\nx\n12\n,\nx\n23\n)\n(x_{12},x_{23})\n.

The enclosed area in configuration space is much smaller, and the net displacement decreases significantly.\nIf, instead, the stiffness ratio\nc\n1\n/\nc\n2\nc_{1}/c_{2}\nis kept constant and the rest length ratio\nℓ\n1\n/\nℓ\n2\n\\ell_{1}/\\ell_{2}\nis decreased (pink triangle), the collapse of the second pair occurs earlier than that of the first pair. The consequence is again a much smaller loop in configuration space, together with a significantly lower, sometimes even negative, net displacement.\nBetween the circle and the diamond, there is a relatively sharp transition between the different dynamic states. The transition between these states apparently vanishes at a critical point when\nc\n1\n/\nc\n2\n≈\n0.75\nc_{1}/c_{2}\\approx 0.75\nand\nℓ\n1\n/\nℓ\n2\n≈\n0.4\n\\ell_{1}/\\ell_{2}\\approx 0.4\n.\nFor smaller length ratios, the length of the first spring\nl\n1\n<\n10\nl_{1}<10\nis too short, and the extensibility is below\nϵ\n1\n=\nℓ\n1\n,\nmax\n/\nℓ\n1\n<\n0.6\n\\epsilon_{1}=\\ell_{1,\\text{max}}/\\ell_{1}<0.6\n.\nAs shown in Sec.\nII\nfor two spheres, no bifurcations, and thus no hysteretic behavior occurs for such low extensibilities. Due to its absence, the transition is thus more continuous.\nFigure 4:\n(a) Color map of the net displacement\nΔ\n​\nx\n2\n\\Delta x_{2}\nafter one full cycle of the magnetic field for swimmers with different ratios of spring stiffness\nc\n1\n/\nc\n2\nc_{1}/c_{2}\nand rest lengths\nℓ\n1\n/\nℓ\n2\n\\ell_{1}/\\ell_{2}\n(phase space).\nFor all swimmers\nc\n2\n=\n10\nc_{2}=10\n,\nℓ\n2\n=\n25\n\\ell_{2}=25\n, and in the fully compressed state the center-to-center distance is still larger than\nℓ\ni\n,\nmax\n−\nℓ\ni\n=\n4\n\\ell_{i,\\text{max}}-\\ell_{i}=4\n.

The term\nh\n2\n​\n(\nt\n)\nh^{2}(t)\nenters affinely into the total force, resulting from the potential in Eq. (\n4\n). Consequently, by Pontryagin’s maximum principle\n[\n34\n]\nfrom optimal control theory, the magnetic field which leads to the extremal velocity must lie on the boundary of the manifold, that is, be a\nbang-bang control\n.

Performing the same evolutionary optimization strategy within this class gives rise to a swimmer whose cycles are shown in\nFig.\n6\n. The amplitude of the magnetic field in\nFig.\n6\n(b) remains similar to the one of the cosine-shaped field in\nFig.\n5\n(b). Yet, the frequency can be increased whilst keeping similar displacement per period and thus the swimmer is around\n18\n%\n18\\%\nfaster.\nFigure 6:\n(a) Three cycles of the trajectories of a three-sphere microswimmer with parameters\nc\n1\n=\n8.1\nc_{1}=8.1\n,\nc\n2\n=\n9.8\nc_{2}=9.8\n,\nℓ\n1\n=\n13.2\n\\ell_{1}=13.2\n,\nℓ\n2\n=\n17.0\n\\ell_{2}=17.0\nand\nℓ\ni\n,\nmax\n=\nℓ\ni\n−\n4\n\\ell_{i,\\text{max}}=\\ell_{i}-4\n.\nThe net displacement accrued over one cycle of the magnetic field is\nΔ\n​\nx\n2\n=\n0.769\n\\Delta x_{2}=0.769\n.

This dependence can be used to independently control multiple swimmers individually, as shown in\nFig.\n7\n.\nThere, appropriate adjustment of the maximum and minimum field magnitudes allows to either address one or the other of the two swimmers in a way to induce substantial net motion. In contrast to that, the second swimmer remains basically at rest during that time.\nFigure 7:\n(a) The trajectories of a three-sphere microswimmer with parameters\nc\n1\n=\n8.1\nc_{1}=8.1\n,\nc\n2\n=\n9.8\nc_{2}=9.8\n,\nℓ\n1\n=\n13.2\n\\ell_{1}=13.2\n,\nℓ\n2\n=\n17.0\n\\ell_{2}=17.0\nand\nℓ\ni\n,\nmax\n=\nℓ\ni\n−\n4\n\\ell_{i,\\text{max}}=\\ell_{i}-4\n, identically to\nFig.\n6\n. At first, when the driving magnetic field has the right magnitude, the swimmer completes full cycles leading to net displacement. When the driving field is decreased in magnitude, the swimmer does not reach the fully collapsed state and by lack of pronounced nonreciprocity it oscillates in place.\n(b) Setting the parameters of a second three-sphere microswimmer differently, here to\nc\n1\n=\n6.0\n,\nc_{1}=6.0,\nc\n2\n=\n6.9\nc_{2}=6.9\n,\nℓ\n1\n=\n13.0\n\\ell_{1}=13.0\n,\nℓ\n2\n=\n17.0\n\\ell_{2}=17.0\n, and\nℓ\ni\n,\nmax\n=\nℓ\ni\n−\n4\n\\ell_{i,\\text{max}}=\\ell_{i}-4\n, can facilitate targeted stimulation of one of the swimmers by adjusting the field magnitudes. First, when the driving magnetic field has a larger magnitude, since the springs are weaker, the swimmer never fully expands, and the cycles remain incomplete. The swimmer oscillates basically in place. When the driving field is decreased in magnitude, the swimmer completes full cycles and therefore achieves substantial net displacement.\n(c) Throughout, the driving magnetic field\nh\n​\n(\nt\n)\nh(t)\nof triangular shape is of fixed slew rate\nd\n​\nh\n/\nd\n​\nt\n=\n±\n0.59\n\\text{d}h/\\text{d}t=\\pm 0.59\n.

Newer designs using hard magnetic materials can reach speeds on the order of millimeters per second\n[\n43\n]\nusing higher frequencies of rotating fields.\nOur approach uses an order of magnitude stronger magnetic fields but of a simpler geometry, oscillating in magnitude with constant direction. This could make actuation and control more accessible. However, the fabrication of such a three-sphere swimmer may prove to be more challenging than that of artificial bacterial flagella because of the moving parts and the need for appropriate elastic springs.\nThe proposed design could be realized using superparamagnetic iron oxide\n[\n12\n]\n, DNA springs\n[\n22\n]\n, or 3D printed elastomers\n[\n14\n]\nas springs.\nEvolutions of this design, which go beyond the simple minimalist model presented here, could include a microrobot that is entirely printed from an elastomer with embedded magnetic particles that deform the robot body under the influence of an external magnetic field.\nMore complex motion patterns, such as beating cilia or undulating sperm tails, could be achievable. We hope that this theoretical and numerical study can inspire future experimental realizations and investigations of such microswimmers.\nAcknowledgements.\nT.L. thanks the Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes (German Academic Scholarship Foundation), Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (German Academic Exchange Service), and the Excellence Scholarship & Opportunity Programme (ESOP) from ETH Zürich for financial and academic support.\nA.M.M. acknowledges support by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation, DFG) through project no. 541972050, DFG reference no. ME 3571/12-1.\nData availability\nAll the code and data to reproduce the figures are available at\nhttps://github.com/TheoLequy/magspheres\n.\nAppendix A\nAnalytical expressions for bifurcation locations\nThe equilibrium positions of the two-sphere setup are found from\n∂\nU\n2\n/\n∂\nr\n=\n0\n\\partial U_{2}/\\partial r=0\n, see\nEq.\n3\n.\nFrom there, we obtain a quintic polynomial equation in\nr\nr\n,\n0\n=\nr\n5\n−\nr\n4\n+\nβ\n2\nϵ\n2\n​\n(\nϵ\n2\n−\n(\nr\n−\n1\n)\n2\n)\n.\n0=r^{5}-r^{4}+\\frac{\\beta^{2}}{\\epsilon^{2}}\\left(\\epsilon^{2}-(r-1)^{2}\\right).\n(12)\nHowever, among the resulting roots, at most three are physical with\nr\n∈\n(\n1\n−\nϵ\n,\n1\n+\nϵ\n)\nr\\in(1-\\epsilon,1+\\epsilon)\n.\nSaddle-node bifurcations occur at the local extrema of\nβ\n\\beta\n.

    "preview_text": "When swimming at low Reynolds numbers, inertial effects are negligible and reciprocal movements cannot induce net motion. Instead, symmetry breaking is necessary to achieve net propulsion. Directed swimming can be supported by magnetic fields, which simultaneously provide a versatile means of remote actuation. Thus, we analyze the motion of a straight microswimmer composed of three magnetizable beads connected by two elastic links. The swimming mechanism is based on oriented external magnetic fields that oscillate in magnitude. Through induced reversible hysteretic collapse of the two segments of the swimmer, the two pairs of beads jump into contact and separate nonreciprocally. Due to higher-order hydrodynamic interactions, net displacement results after each cycle. Different microswimmers can be tuned to different driving amplitudes and frequencies, allowing for simultaneous independent control by just one external magnetic field. The swimmer geometry and magnetic field shape are optimized for maximum swimming speed using an evolutionary optimization strategy. Thanks to the simple working principle, an experimental realization of such a microrobot seems feasible and may open new approaches for microinvasive medical interventions such as targeted drug delivery.\n\nOptimizing the Design of a Simple Three-Sphere Magnetic Microswimmer\nTheo Lequy\ntlequy@ethz.ch\nEidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich, Rämistrasse 101, 8092 Zürich, Switzerland\nAndreas M.
