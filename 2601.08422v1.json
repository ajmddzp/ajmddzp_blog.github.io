appropriate behaviors through physical human guidance.\nHowever, learning through physical engagement can place a heavy burden on users when the process requires large amounts of human-provided data.\nTo address this, we propose a human-in-the-loop framework that enables robots to acquire navigational behaviors in a data-efficient manner and to be controlled via multimodal natural human inputs, specifically gestural and verbal commands.\nWe reconstruct interaction scenes using a physics-based simulation and aggregate data to mitigate distributional shifts arising from limited demonstration data.\nOur\nprogressive goal cueing\nstrategy adaptively feeds appropriate commands and navigation goals during training, leading to more accurate navigation and stronger alignment between human input and robot behavior.\nWe evaluate our framework across six real-world agile navigation scenarios, including jumping over or avoiding obstacles.\nOur experimental results show that our proposed method succeeds in almost all trials across these scenarios, achieving a 97.15% task success rate with less than 1 hour of demonstration data in total.\nI\nIntroduction\nDogs have remarkable abilities to interpret human behavior through social cues and seamlessly perform given tasks.\nFor instance, they can follow a pointing gesture, track a handler’s gaze, or respond to brief verbal commands with precise actions.\nIn contrast, current robot operation still primarily relies on manual control interfaces such as joysticks or keyboards.\nThese methods require continuous attention and fine-grained control, limiting their practicality for everyday use by non-experts.\nMotivated by this, we aim to develop a system that maps natural human cues to corresponding robot behaviors.\nBuilding such a system involves two core challenges.\nFirst, single-modal commands, such as verbal or gestural instructions alone, introduce ambiguity.\nFor instance, verbal commands such as “go there” are inherently ambiguous unless the system correctly interprets the user’s pointing gesture that specifies the target location.\nSecond, collecting large-scale real-world human–robot interaction data to learn such multimodal associations is costly.\nTherefore, it is crucial that the system can learn new interaction patterns from only a few interactions.\nPrior work on natural robot interfaces has explored gesture-based control or language-conditioned navigation, but often relies on a single modality and substantial data collection.\nIn this paper, we introduce a human-in-the-loop framework for teaching and controlling quadruped robots through multimodal interactions, termed\nLURE\n(\nL\nuring-based\nU\nser–\nR\nobot\nE\nngagement), which enables data-efficient learning from few demonstrations.\nInspired by the\nluring\ntechnique used by professional dog trainers, users first physically guide the robot with a teaching rod while issuing gestures and verbal commands.\nWe then reconstruct the interaction scenes in a physics-based simulator, where the robot learns navigation skills that overcome distributional shifts arising from limited data, i.e., mismatches between the training and deployment distributions\n[\n14\n]\n.\nDuring training, we adaptively determine intermediate commands and navigation goals to improve context-aligned navigation, a process we refer to as\nprogressive goal cueing\n.\nAt run time, the learned policy enables intuitive control via human gestures and verbal commands, allowing the robot to perform agile movements in cluttered environments.\nFigure 1\n:\nThe proposed framework enables agile robot behaviors through verbal and gesture-based commands.\nWe demonstrate that the proposed framework enables users to control quadruped robots to overcome obstacles using verbal and gesture commands.\nFor instance, in the\nJump Over\nscenario shown in\nFigure\n1\n, the robot correctly interprets the user’s intention to jump over the box and executes the desired action.\nExtensive experiments show that our system enables navigation through cluttered environments in a data-efficient manner with less than 1 hour of data across six scenarios.\nTo summarize the key contributions of this work:\n1.\nWe present a system that enables users to teach and control quadruped robots in cluttered environments through real-time gestural and verbal commands.\n2.\nWe propose a data-aggregation technique that enables robots to learn new interaction patterns using only a few demonstrations.\n3.\nWe experimentally show that verbal and nonverbal cues complement each other in interpreting user intent.\nII\nRelated Work\nOur goal is to enable users to teach and control a legged robot through natural interactions.\nThis objective aligns with the human-in-the-loop control paradigm, as the robot is operated through human feedback.\nOur approach also relates to learning from demonstrations, as we leverage interactive human demonstrations to acquire navigation skills.\nIn the following sections, we discuss related work on both aspects.\nII-A\nHuman-in-the-Loop Robot Interfaces\nRecent efforts in robot control have increasingly focused on designing more intuitive interfaces that move beyond manual devices such as joysticks or keypads.\nIn particular, controlling robots through human gestures and verbal commands has been a long-standing objective in human-robot interaction\n[\n8\n]\n.\nWhile numerous studies have investigated the utility of these modalities, they have primarily focused on using either gestures or verbal commands in isolation.\nA number of studies proposed a straightforward gesture-based human-robot interaction by manually mapping a predefined set of human gestures to a discrete number of robot actions.\nFor instance,\nShin\net al.\n[\n15\n]\nand\nZafar\net al.\n[\n24\n]\nmap current body keypoints directly to discretized robot actions.\nWhile these approaches are simple, discrete actions lack expressiveness, motivating continuous gesture-to-action interfaces.\nIn this direction,\nXie\net al.\n[\n22\n]\ntransferred hand motions at the velocity level for continuous robot control, while\nCuan\net al.\n[\n7\n]\nmapped user gestures to robot actions using imitation learning.\nHowever, directly mapping hand motions to low-level robot actions requires continuous, exhaustive user attention, similar to joystick-based teleoperation.\nVerbal command-based control interfaces have been explored, particularly in the context of language-conditioned navigation.\nCheng\net al.\n[\n5\n]\nproposed a vision-language-action model for legged navigation, enabling text-driven goal specification.\nMore recently,\nXue\net al.\n[\n23\n]\nembedded latent vision-language representations into a humanoid whole-body controller, enabling visual navigation from language instructions.\nDespite these advances, many language-based systems still suffer from spatial ambiguities.\nFor instance, interpreting a vague command like “go there” can be challenging, as the destination is not explicitly specified in language but must be resolved through supplementary cues such as gaze or pointing.\nTo address these limitations, we complement the strength of verbal commands and gestures within a unified real-time interface.\nBy grounding language with accompanying user gestures, our system resolves spatial ambiguities and provides clearer intent signals for navigation.\nII-B\nLearning Navigation from Demonstrations\nLearning from Demonstration (LfD) enables users to teach behaviors through examples, providing an intuitive way to teach by direct demonstration rather than relying on handcrafted rules\n[\n18\n,\n2\n]\n.\nIn line with this, we adopt LfD as a natural framework for learning new behaviors from interactive and physically guided user demonstrations.\nEarly applications of LfD to navigation focused on single-goal imitation, with policies trained to follow expert-provided trajectories.\nA pivotal work by\nPomerleau [\n12\n]\ntrained neural networks to imitate human driving behavior for lane following, while more recent approaches\n[\n20\n]\nguide path imitation using environment feature maps.\nRecent work advances toward multi-skill navigation that interprets high-level commands and produces context-appropriate behaviors.\nFor example,\nWu\net al.\n[\n21\n]\nproposed a generative imitation learning framework for target-driven visual navigation in indoor scenes, enabling policies to generalize to novel goals based on demonstration data.\nSingh\net al.\n[\n17\n]\nproposed a goal-conditioned navigation framework that grounds implicit free-form language expressions into spatial targets, enabling mobile agents to interpret diverse instructions such as “go to the bed”.\nDespite these advances, LfD is prone to distributional shift due to limited demonstration coverage, which can degrade performance or lead to task failure.\nAs in prior work, we study demonstration-based navigation, where robots navigate using verbal instructions and gestures.\nIn particular, we focus on mitigating distributional shifts under limited demonstrations via data augmentation.\nFigure 2\n:\nThe problem is formulated as an MDP with observations\n(\n𝐱\n,\n𝝆\n,\n𝐜\n)\n(\\mathbf{x},\\bm{\\rho},\\mathbf{c})\nand actions representing the navigation goal\n𝐠\n\\mathbf{g}\n.\nThe transition dynamics include the pretrained locomotion controller\nπ\nu\n\\pi_{u}\n, the robot dynamics\nf\nf\n, and the human model\nh\nh\n, while the reward is defined as the alignment between the predicted and intended goals.\nIII\nProblem Formulation\nLet the robot state be\n𝐱\n\\mathbf{x}\n, and the control input be\n𝐮\n\\mathbf{u}\n, where\n𝐱\n\\mathbf{x}\nconsists of the robot’s base position and orientation, joint angles, and their corresponding velocities, and\n𝐮\n\\mathbf{u}\ndenotes the motor torque commands.\nWe assume that the robot dynamics are defined by a function\nf\nf\n, such that\n𝐱\n′\n=\nf\n​\n(\n𝐱\n,\n𝐮\n)\n\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime}=f(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{u})\n, where\n𝐱\n′\n\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime}\ndenotes the state at the next time step.\nThe robot operates in a cluttered environment, where the surrounding environment is represented by a heightmap\n𝝆\n\\bm{\\rho}\n.\nOur objective is to enable a human user to control the robot to perform a navigation task\n𝒯\n\\mathcal{T}\nvia interaction commands\n𝐜\n\\mathbf{c}\n, consisting of a gesture command\n𝐦\n\\mathbf{m}\nand a verbal command\n𝐯\n\\mathbf{v}\n.\nSpecifically, we model the human as a function\nh\nh\nthat produces an intended navigation goal\n𝐠\n∗\n\\mathbf{g}^{*}\ntogether with interaction commands\n𝐜\n\\mathbf{c}\n, expressed as\n(\n𝐜\n,\n𝐠\n∗\n)\n=\nh\n​\n(\n𝐱\n,\n𝝆\n,\n𝒯\n)\n(\\mathbf{c},\\mathbf{g}^{*})=h(\\mathbf{x},\\bm{\\rho},\\mathcal{T})\n.\nGiven the interaction commands\n𝐜\n\\mathbf{c}\n, the robot interprets the user’s intent and moves toward the intended goal\n𝐠\n∗\n\\mathbf{g}^{*}\n.\nFormally, we develop a policy\nπ\n\\pi\nthat generates control inputs\n𝐮\n=\nπ\n​\n(\n𝐱\n,\n𝐜\n,\n𝝆\n)\n\\mathbf{u}=\\pi(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{c},\\bm{\\rho})\n, enabling the robot to infer human intent and accomplish the navigation task\n𝒯\n\\mathcal{T}\nby reaching the intended goal\n𝐠\n∗\n\\mathbf{g}^{*}\n.\nAs shown in\nFigure\n2\n, we decompose the problem into two subsystems: a\nhigh-level navigation module\nand a\nlow-level locomotion controller\n.\nThe navigation module, denoted as\nπ\ng\n\\pi_{g}\n, serves as a high-level System 2 planner that interprets human intent and predicts navigation goals\n𝐠\n\\mathbf{g}\n, represented as\n𝐠\n=\nπ\ng\n​\n(\n𝐜\n,\n𝐱\n,\n𝝆\n)\n\\mathbf{g}=\\pi_{g}(\\mathbf{c},\\mathbf{x},\\bm{\\rho})\n.\nThe locomotion controller, represented as\n𝐮\n=\nπ\nu\n​\n(\n𝐠\n,\n𝐱\n,\n𝝆\n)\n\\mathbf{u}=\\pi_{u}(\\mathbf{g},\\mathbf{x},\\bm{\\rho})\n, functions as a fast and reactive System 1 module that executes agile behaviors to overcome obstacles.\nBy integrating these two modules, robot is controlled directly by high-level interaction commands.\nWe pretrain a locomotion controller\nπ\nu\n\\pi_{u}\ncapable of tracking arbitrary goals across diverse terrains and obstacles, and subsequently focus on the high-level navigation problem.\nWe formulate this problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem, where the observation is defined as\n(\n𝐱\n,\n𝝆\n,\n𝐜\n)\n(\\mathbf{x},\\bm{\\rho},\\mathbf{c})\nand the action corresponds to the navigation goal\n𝐠\n\\mathbf{g}\nexpressed in the robot frame.\nIn more detail, the navigation policy\nπ\ng\n\\pi_{g}\noutputs navigation goal\n𝐠\n\\mathbf{g}\nbased on the interaction signal\n𝐜\n\\mathbf{c}\n, where the reward function is defined by how closely\n𝐠\n\\mathbf{g}\nmatches the intended navigation goal\n𝐠\n∗\n\\mathbf{g}^{*}\n.\nThe locomotion controller\nπ\nu\n\\pi_{u}\nthen takes the navigation goal\n𝐠\n\\mathbf{g}\nto produce a control signal\n𝐮\n=\nπ\nu\n​\n(\n𝐠\n,\n𝐱\n,\n𝝆\n)\n\\mathbf{u}=\\pi_{u}(\\mathbf{g},\\mathbf{x},\\bm{\\rho})\n.\nSubsequently, the robot dynamics\nf\nf\nproduce the robot state\n𝐱\n′\n\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime}\nat the next time step, and the human model\nh\nh\ngenerates the corresponding gesture\n𝐦\n′\n\\mathbf{m}^{\\prime}\nand language command\n𝐯\n′\n\\mathbf{v}^{\\prime}\n, completing the state transition.\nWe address this MDP using data aggregation\n[\n14\n]\nto mitigate the distributional shift problem, which is augmenting expert actions based on the current policy’s state distribution, denoted as\n𝒟\nπ\ng\n\\mathcal{D}^{\\pi_{g}}\n.\nFormally, the problem is formulated as\narg\n⁡\nmin\nπ\ng\n∈\nΠ\n⁡\n𝔼\n(\n𝐜\n,\n𝐱\n,\n𝝆\n,\n𝐠\n∗\n)\n∼\n𝒟\nπ\ng\n​\n[\n‖\n𝐠\n∗\n−\nπ\ng\n​\n(\n𝐜\n,\n𝐱\n,\n𝝆\n)\n‖\n2\n]\n.\n\\arg\\min_{\\pi_{g}\\in\\Pi}\\,\\mathbb{E}_{(\\mathbf{c},\\mathbf{x},\\bm{\\rho},{\\mathbf{g}^{*}})\\sim\\mathcal{D}^{\\pi_{g}}}\\left[\\left\\|{{\\mathbf{g}^{*}}}-\\pi_{g}(\\mathbf{c},\\mathbf{x},\\bm{\\rho})\\right\\|^{2}\\right].\n(1)\nAddressing distributional shifts is particularly important, as the high cost of collecting interaction data leads to limited demonstrations, making the system especially prone to them.\nData aggregation requires two key components.\nFirst, it requires the transition dynamics, including the human model\nh\nh\n.\nSince manually encoding the intended navigation goal\n𝐠\n\\mathbf{g}\nand the corresponding interaction commands\n𝐜\n\\mathbf{c}\nis impractical, we use demonstration data to approximate the human model as\nh\n~\n\\tilde{h}\n, as discussed in\nSection\nIV-D\n.\nSecond, data aggregation requires an expert policy to provide actions at previously unseen states.\nWe construct a locally approximated expert\nπ\n~\ng\n\\tilde{\\pi}_{g}\nthat produces actions for novel states and enables efficient data aggregation, as described in\nSection\nIV-C\n.\nFigure 3\n:\nOverview of the proposed framework. We first establish a locomotion controller that follows the navigation goal\n𝐠\n\\mathbf{g}\n. In Stage 1, we collect interaction data\n𝒟\n=\n{\n𝐯\n,\n𝐦\n,\n𝝆\n,\n𝐱\n,\n𝐠\n∗\n}\n\\mathcal{D}=\\{\\mathbf{v},\\mathbf{m},\\bm{\\rho},\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{g}^{*}\\}\nthrough natural interactions between two participants. In Stage 2, we reconstruct the interaction scene from\n𝒟\n\\mathcal{D}\nand train the navigation module via data aggregation. The framework progressively provides the interaction and navigation goals only after the robot reaches its current goal, ensuring alignment between the command and behavior. Finally, in Stage 3, the user can control the robot through interaction.\nIV\nMethod\nOur goal is to develop a policy that can interpret the verbal command\n𝐯\n\\mathbf{v}\nand gesture command\n𝐦\n\\mathbf{m}\nto reach the navigation goal\n𝐠\n∗\n\\mathbf{g}^{*}\n.\nTo achieve this, our framework comprises several key components, as illustrated in\nFigure\n3\n.\nWe begin by introducing an agile locomotion controller that enables the robot to perform dynamic movements such as stepping over or around obstacles.\nNext, we collect interaction data using this locomotion controller.\nFinally, we reconstruct interaction scenes in which robots are trained via data augmentation, enabling control through natural gestural and verbal commands with limited demonstration data.\nIV-A\nLocomotion controller\nAs a preliminary stage, we develop a locomotion controller for low-level agility of the robot.\nAs shown in the Stage 0 from\nFigure\n3\n, the locomotion controller consists of a velocity planner and a velocity tracker.\nThe velocity planner converts the navigation goal\n𝐠\n\\mathbf{g}\ninto a velocity command guiding the robot toward its target.\nIn more detail, it outputs a heading velocity command\nv\ncom\n=\nK\n​\n‖\n𝐠\nx\n​\ny\n−\n𝐩\nx\n​\ny\n‖\n2\nv_{\\text{com}}=K\\|\\mathbf{g}^{xy}-\\mathbf{p}^{xy}\\|_{2}\nand an rotation command\nϕ\ncom\n=\nyaw\n​\n(\nR\n⊤\n​\n(\n𝐠\n−\n𝐩\n)\n)\n\\phi_{\\text{com}}=\\text{yaw}(R^{\\top}(\\mathbf{g}-\\mathbf{p}))\n, where\n𝐩\n∈\nℝ\n3\n\\mathbf{p}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}\nis the robot’s base position,\nR\n∈\nSO\n​\n(\n3\n)\nR\\in\\mathrm{SO}(3)\nis the robot’s rotation matrix and\n(\n⋅\n)\nx\n​\ny\n(\\cdot)^{xy}\nindicates ground-projected coordinates.\nThe other component is the velocity tracker, which enables the robot to track the commanded velocity.\nAlthough our framework is compatible with any velocity tracker, we trained a specialized tracker designed for dynamic locomotion to support agile behaviors, such as obstacle jumping.\nMore details on our velocity tracking policy are discussed in\nSection\nIV-F\n.\nIV-B\nHuman-in-the-loop data collection through luring\nWe collect human–robot interaction data by luring, as illustrated in Stage 1 of\nFigure\n3\n.\nThe process requires two participants: one issues both verbal and non-verbal commands, while the other guides the robot using a teaching rod.\nThis setup allows us to collect paired interaction and navigation data, which we refer to as the interaction data\n𝒟\n\\mathcal{D}\n.\nDetails on the representation of verbal commands and gestural cues are provided in\nSection\nIV-F\n.\nAs shown in\nFigure\n3\n, the interaction data\n𝒟\n\\mathcal{D}\nconsists of the robot state\n𝐱\n\\mathbf{x}\n, the target position\n𝐠\n∗\n\\mathbf{g}^{*}\n, the gesture command\n𝐦\n\\mathbf{m}\n, the verbal command\n𝐯\n\\mathbf{v}\n, and the obstacle representation\n𝝆\n\\bm{\\rho}\n.\nAll data is recorded in a global coordinate frame, providing sufficient information for full scene reconstruction.\nThis scene reconstruction is a crucial component of our framework, as it enables data aggregation that improves robustness to distributional shifts, as discussed in\nSection\nIV-C\n.\nIV-C\nData aggregation\nWe reconstruct the interaction scene in the simulation for data aggregation, as shown in Stage 2 of\nFigure\n3\n.\nSpecifically, we recreate the terrain using obstacle information\nρ\n\\rho\nand replay the gesture\n𝐦\n\\mathbf{m}\nand verbal commands\n𝐯\n\\mathbf{v}\n.\nThe robot is trained to follow the intended goal location\n𝐠\n∗\n\\mathbf{g}^{*}\n, defined by the teaching rod position in the interaction data.\nOverall, our training procedure resembles the data aggregation method introduced in DAgger\n[\n14\n]\n, where the agent explores using its current policy while the expert’s actions are augmented to guide learning.\nIn more detail, we define the local expert policy\nπ\n~\ng\n\\tilde{\\pi}_{g}\nthat outputs the expert navigation goal\n𝐠\n~\n\\tilde{\\mathbf{g}}\nin the robot frame, directing the robot towards the global target position\n𝐠\n∗\n\\mathbf{g}^{*}\n.\nBy aggregating these actions, the system can efficiently generate corrective actions in the local frame that steer the robot toward the global target\n𝐠\n∗\n\\mathbf{g}^{*}\n, even when the current policy drifts away from the expert trajectory.\nAs a result, the robot learns to recover from deviations and reach the intended target, effectively mitigating the distributional shift.\nThis approach is justified by our data-collection setup, where the velocity planner drives the robot toward the goal in the robot frame, producing demonstrations consistent with the behavior encoded in the local expert policy\nπ\n~\ng\n\\tilde{\\pi}_{g}\n.\nWe apply domain randomization to deliberately force the agent to deviate from the expert trajectory, exposing it to a broader range of states and enabling it to learn recovery behaviors\n[\n10\n]\n.\nFor example, we vary the robot’s mass and inertia, and apply external pushes to the base.\nTo further improve robustness, we introduce the following techniques, with detailed parameter settings provided in the appendix.\n•\nTerrain scaling\nWe divide the terrain into a uniform grid of\nS\nS\ntiles and scale each tile by a random factor to randomize the spacing between obstacles and goals.\n•\nBinary obstacle map\nWe threshold the height map at\nh\nthres\nh_{\\text{thres}}\nand feed the resulting binary obstacle map to the navigation module, thereby promoting consistent navigation across varying obstacle heights.\n•\nDistractor objects.\nWe introduce square and circular distractor objects to mitigate overfitting to specific obstacle arrangements.\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n(e)\n(f)\nFigure 4\n:\nIllustration of data collection procedures for six interactive navigation scenarios.\n(a)\nGo there\n, (b)\nCome here\n, and (c)\nFollow me\nrepresent human-robot interactions in open space.\n(d)\nCome around\nand (e)\nJump over\nillustrate interactions involving a box obstacle.\n(f)\nZigzag\ndemonstrates interaction with multiple tire obstacles.\nIV-D\nProgressive goal cueing\nIt is crucial to provide interaction commands and navigation goals that align with the robot’s current state during training, as misalignment can lead to inconsistent supervision.\nOne naive approach is to feed gesture and verbal commands to the policy according to their original timestamps.\nHowever, during early training, the policy often progresses more slowly through tasks, leading to new commands being issued before the robot has completed the preceding behavior.\nSince the interaction data were collected by issuing new commands in response to the robot’s task progress, this navie replay strategy can introduce state–command misalignment.\nTo address this, we propose a\nprogressive goal cueing\nthat dynamically presents the interaction command based on the robot’s state.\nAs illustrated in Stage 2 of\nFigure\n3\n, each interaction command is held constant while the robot moves toward the current goal and is updated once the target is reached.\nThis allows the human model\nh\nh\nto wait for the robot rather than rushing through the episode when the robot struggles to navigate correctly in the early stages.\nOverall, it results in more context-aware control and enables finer movements during execution, as demonstrated later in\nSection\nV-C\n.\nAt each timestep, we apply progressive goal cueing with a 50% probability; otherwise, it advances to the next interaction according to the simulation clock.\nThis design choice prevents excessive waiting and improves responsiveness during real-world deployment.\nAdditionally, the waiting behavior naturally fades out as the robot begins producing correct movements in the latter stage of training.\nIV-E\nInteraction Data Augmentation\nSince our model is trained from limited interaction data, preventing overfitting and promoting generalization across both gesture and verbal modalities are essential.\nTherefore, we apply modality-specific input augmentation for both gestures and verbal commands.\nFor gestures, we perturb the extracted keypoints with noise\nϵ\n𝐦\n\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{m}}\nfor every simulation time step.\nThis models the natural variability in repeated human motions as well as noise introduced during pose estimation.\nFor verbal commands, we leverage a Large Language Model (LLM)\n[\n1\n]\nto generate semantically equivalent expressions.\nSpecifically, for each verbal command collected in\nSection\nV-A\n, we prompt the LLM to produce\nN\nv\nN_{v}\nalternative phrasings, from which one is randomly sampled during training.\nIV-F\nImplementation details\nThis section provides additional implementation details regarding the perception and command representations, as well as the velocity tracker policy for low-level locomotion control.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 5\n:\nAnalysis of collected data in terms of\n(a) total wall clock time and\n(b) number of episodes for each scenario\nIV-F\n1\nRepresentation\nWe describe how each input modality is represented and captured in real time.\nThe verbal command is segmented using Silero

We consider six upper-body keypoints—the shoulders, elbows, and wrists on both the left and right sides—and express their 3D positions in the robot frame as\n𝐩\nsh.r\n,\n𝐩\nel.r\n,\n𝐩\nwr.r\n,\n𝐩\nsh.l\n,\n𝐩\nel.l\n,\n𝐩\nwr.l\n\\mathbf{p}_{\\text{sh.r}},\\mathbf{p}_{\\text{el.r}},\\mathbf{p}_{\\text{wr.r}},\\mathbf{p}_{\\text{sh.l}},\\mathbf{p}_{\\text{el.l}},\\mathbf{p}_{\\text{wr.l}}\n. Using these keypoints, we define the gesture command as\n𝐦\n=\n[\n𝐝\nsh.r,el.r\n,\n𝐝\nel.r,wr.r\n,\n𝐝\nsh.l,el.l\n,\n𝐝\nel.l,wr.l\n,\n𝐝\nsh.l,sh.r\n,\n(\n𝐩\nsh.l\n+\n𝐩\nsh.r\n)\nx\n​\ny\n/\n2\n,\nϕ\nh\n]\n\\mathbf{m}=\\big[\\mathbf{d}_{\\text{sh.r,el.r}},\\ \\mathbf{d}_{\\text{el.r,wr.r}},\\ \\mathbf{d}_{\\text{sh.l,el.l}},\\ \\mathbf{d}_{\\text{el.l,wr.l}},\\ \\mathbf{d}_{\\text{sh.l,sh.r}},\\ (\\mathbf{p}_{\\text{sh.l}}+\\mathbf{p}_{\\text{sh.r}})^{xy}/2,\\ \\phi_{h}\\big]\n,\nwhere\n𝐝\n\\mathbf{d}\ndenotes the unit vector between two points, and\nϕ\nh\n\\phi_{h}\nrepresents the human yaw.\nRegarding the obstacles, we measure their dimensions in advance and estimate their poses using motion capture cameras.\nUsing this information, we obtain a heightmap in the robot frame for the locomotion controller\nπ\nu\n\\pi_{u}\nand a thresholded binary mask for the navigation module\nπ\ng\n\\pi_{g}\n.\nIV-F\n2\nVelocity tracker\nWe train a velocity tracker operating at 50 Hz to overcome the obstacles.\nThe training scheme is similar to the work of\nCheng\net al.\n[\n6\n]\nand is trained in Isaac Gym\n[\n11\n]\nto track velocity commands\nv\ncom\n∈\n[\n0.0\n,\n1.0\n]\n​\nm\n/\ns\nv_{\\text{com}}\\in[0.0,1.0]~\\mathrm{m/s}\nand angular velocity commands\nw\ncom\n∈\n[\n−\nπ\n/\n3\n,\nπ\n/\n3\n]\n​\nrad\n/\ns\nw_{\\text{com}}\\in[-\\pi/3,\\pi/3]~\\mathrm{rad/s}\n.\nTo improve robustness, we introduce a stand boolean in the state representation by thresholding velocity commands\nv\ncom\nv_{\\text{com}}\n, which enhances walk–stand transitions.\nFor real-world deployment, we use a Kalman filter–based state estimator\n[\n3\n]\nthat fuses joint encoder, foot contact, and motion capture data for stable feedback.\nAlthough the robot can be trained to move faster, we limit its speed for safety.\nV\nResults\nWe conduct a series of experiments to assess the effectiveness and generality of our framework.\nWe begin by describing the interaction scenarios considered in this study and then compare our method with imitation learning baselines to evaluate our proposed data aggregation and progressive goal cueing strategy.\nWe then show that our system can quickly learn new interaction patterns from novel users with less than five minutes of interaction.\nNext, we conduct an ablation study to demonstrate how verbal and gestural cues complement each other.\nFinally, we demonstrate multi-obstacle navigation in a real-world environment, showing that our system can robustly execute complex task sequences using a single unified policy.\nV-A\nData Collection\nWe collect interaction data, denoted as\n𝒟\n\\mathcal{D}\n, comprising human interaction\n𝐜\n\\mathbf{\\mathbf{c}}\n, robot states\n𝐱\n\\mathbf{x}\n, obstacle representations\n𝝆\n\\bm{\\rho}\n, and target goals\n𝐠\n∗\n\\mathbf{g}^{*}\n, recorded at a frequency of 10Hz.\nWe define six interaction scenarios, as shown in\nFigure\n4\n, and a stop scenario.\n•\nStop:\nA person raises both arms and says “stop,” prompting the robot to halt at its current position.\n•\nGo there:\nA person points with one hand and says “go there,” and the robot moves toward the indicated location.\n•\nCome here:\nA person calls the robot by saying “come here” with the arms dropped, and the robot moves directly toward the person.\n•\nFollow me:\nA person raises either their left or right hand and says “follow me,” and the robot follows on the corresponding side of the raised hand.\n•\nCome around:\nA person stands in front of a box and says “come around,” prompting the robot to move toward the human while avoiding the obstacle. Both hands move towards the direction intended for coming around the obstacle (left or right).\n•\nJump over:\nA person waves one hand over their head while saying “jump over,” causing the robot to jump over the obstacle.\n•\nZigzag:\nA person gestures with one hand to indicate the movement direction while saying “zigzag,” and the robot navigates between the tires in a zigzag pattern when viewed from above.\nThe summary of total data collection time and the number of episodes per scenario is detailed in\nFigure\n5\n.\nWhile we introduce these scenarios as representative cases, the proposed framework can support a much broader range of interactions\nwithout relying on predefined cases\n.\nV-B\nBaselines\nWe compare our proposed method to three imitation learning algorithms.\nV-B\n1\nBC\n[\n12\n]\nAs a most basic baseline, we train the navigation policy using standard Behavior Cloning (BC).\nThe policy is learned purely from expert demonstrations.\nV-B\n2\nGAIL\n[\n9\n]\nWe use Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) as a baseline to compare against inverse reinforcement learning methods that are known for their generalization capabilities.\nThe policy is learned via adversarial training to match the expert behavior distribution.\nThis baseline allows us to compare our approach against an imitation framework that focuses on generalization.\nV-B\n3\nDAgger\n[\n14\n]\nWe train the policy using data aggregation with a local expert\nπ\n~\ng\n\\tilde{\\pi}_{g}\nconsistent with our proposed framework.\nHowever, we do not apply progressive goal cueing.\nInstead, interaction commands are issued according to the simulation time clock.\nWe reconstruct the scene and apply domain randomization to induce a distributional shift, from which the policy learns robust recovery, as described in\nIV-C\n.\nV-B\n4\nLURE (Ours)\nOur proposed method, LURE, utilizes data aggregation and domain randomization as in DAgger. In addition, we apply progressive goal cueing.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 6\n:\nComparison of baseline methods across six interactive navigation scenarios.\n(a) Navigation error (m) of BC, GAIL, DAgger, and our proposed method.\n(b) Success rate (%) for the same scenarios.\nTABLE I:\nSuccess Rate and Navigation Error per Scenario, Subject, and Adaptation\nScenario\nSubject #1\nSubject #2\nSubject #3\nSuccuess Rate\n↑\n\\uparrow\nNavigation Error\n↓\n\\downarrow\nSuccuess Rate\n↑\n\\uparrow\nNavigation Error\n↓\n\\downarrow\nSuccuess Rate\n↑\n\\uparrow\nNavigation Error\n↓\n\\downarrow\nw/o Adpt.\nAdpt.\nw/o Adpt.\nAdpt.\nw/o Adpt.\nAdpt.\nw/o Adpt.\nAdpt.\nw/o Adpt.\nAdpt.\nw/o Adpt.\nAdpt.\nGo there\n0.66\n0.87\n0.71\n0.53\n0.86\n0.99\n0.57\n0.51\n0.68\n1.00\n0.72\n0.54\nCome here\n0.90\n1.00\n0.39\n0.28\n1.00\n1.00\n0.38\n0.18\n1.00\n1.00\n0.26\n0.22\nFollow me\n0.88\n1.00\n0.68\n0.36\n0.81\n0.90\n0.50\n0.30\n1.00\n1.00\n0.39\n0.23\nCome around\n0.37\n0.95\n1.13\n0.41\n0.95\n0.95\n0.65\n0.43\n0.10\n1.00\n2.20\n0.89\nJump over\n0.87\n0.95\n1.08\n0.53\n0.73\n0.95\n0.70\n0.55\n0.48\n0.92\n1.11\n0.45\nZigzag\n0.76\n0.95\n0.99\n0.36\n0.50\n0.70\n1.45\n0.73\n0.60\n1.00\n1.04\n0.36\nV-C\nEvaluating Success Rate and Navigation Error\nWe measure both the robot’s success rate and navigation error, as shown in\nFigure\n6\n.\nWe first segment each interaction scene based on the issued verbal command “Stop,” treating each segment as an independent episode.\nFor example, the period between saying “Go There” and issuing “Stop” is regarded as one episode.\nAt the beginning of each episode, we reset the robot’s position to the ground-truth position from data to ensure consistent evaluation.\nDuring evaluation, we disable progressive goal cueing to avoid underestimating the performance of other baselines.\nFor each interaction episode, we evaluate performance on five terrain instances with different scale factors and 20 robots per terrain, resulting in 100 evaluation runs.\nThe reported success rates and navigation errors are then averaged over each scenario.\nTask Success\nWe define task-specific success criteria as follows:\n•\nGo there, Come here, Follow me:\nThe final position of the robot must be within 1 meter of the ground-truth base position.\n•\nCome around:\nThe robot must pass through the correct lateral corridor beside the box, following the direction indicated by the user.\n•\nJump over:\nThe robot must pass through three reference points located along the forward direction of the box, centered at\n−\n0.5\n-0.5\nm,\n0\nm, and\n+\n0.5\n+0.5\nm relative to the box. A pass is counted as successful if the robot comes within 0.2 m of each point.\n•\nZigzag:\nThe robot must pass through all midpoints between the tires while avoiding stepping on any of them. A pass is counted as successful if the robot comes within 0.2 m of each point.\nNavigation Error\nWe compute the navigation error as the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the robot’s base position and a ground-truth trajectory, measured at each timestep during the interaction.\nThe ground-truth trajectory corresponds to the robot motion recorded in the interaction data under the same interaction commands.\nThe final error is obtained by averaging the per-frame MSE over the entire interaction duration.\nThis metric reflects how accurately the policy follows the intended trajectory specified by the interaction commands.\nThe results summarized in\nFigure\n6\nshow that LURE achieves the best performance, with a clear margin, attaining an average success rate of 97.15%.\nBy comparing DAgger with BC, we observe that incorporating data aggregation reduces navigation error by 24.6%.\nIntroducing progressive goal cueing, on top of this, yields an additional 15.2% reduction in navigation error over the DAgger baseline.\nIn terms of success rate, data aggregation improves performance by 18.6%, and progressive goal cueing provides a further 13.7% gain.\nNotably, GAIL outperforms BC on the most challenging Zigzag task, but its overall performance degrades when all skills are considered together.\nOn average, GAIL achieves a 29.32% lower success rate than BC, which may be explained by training instability and mode collapse often observed in adversarial imitation learning.\nTABLE II:\nSuccess Rate (%) and Navigation Error (m) per Scenario and Modality\nScenario\nSucc.

However, this is still lower than the multimodal setting, which achieves 83%.\nV-F\nMulti-Obstacle Navigation\nTo demonstrate that our framework can robustly handle diverse obstacles while seamlessly switching between multiple locomotion skills based on user intent, we conducted an obstacle course experiment, as illustrated in\nFigure\n7\n.\nThe course contains both boxes and tires: the robot first navigates through the tire corridor, avoiding each tire according to the user’s interaction commands.\nAfter clearing the tires, the user issues a “stop” command, upon which the robot halts and then performs the “Jump over” command to overcome the box.\nFinally, in response to the “Go there” command, the robot returns to the starting point.\nAs shown in\nFigure\n7\n, our framework completes this entire sequence five times in a row, demonstrating strong real-world robustness and smooth task transitions under a single unified policy.\nThe robot’s trajectory is obtained using a motion capture system, while the obstacle geometries are reconstructed using a consumer-grade mobile 3D scanning software.\nVI\nLimitations\nWhile our framework enables effective interaction-based learning and control, it currently lacks zero-shot generalization across different users due to substantial inter-subject variability in gesture styles.\nUnlike verbal commands, which benefit from semantic augmentation via Large Language Models (LLMs), our gesture representation is augmented only through noise injection and therefore lacks semantic diversity.\nA promising direction is to develop gesture representations that are semantically structured and jointly grounded in the robot state and surrounding objects, building upon pretrained motion representations such as\nZhang\net al.\n[\n25\n]\n.\nMoreover, our progressive goal cueing provides a simple and efficient way to approximate human behavior in novel states.\nHowever, it only adjusts the timing of replaying human interaction data based on the robot’s state.\nIdeally, human behavior should be generated more dynamically in response to novel states, rather than being constrained to temporally re-aligned demonstrations.\nFinally, our current vision system is restricted to controlled environments, as the objects are modeled as circular or square primitives with pre-measured dimensions, and the human wears a motion capture suit for pose estimation.\nCamera-based human pose estimation and scene reconstruction\n[\n16\n,\nmihajlovic2025volumetricsmpl\n]\ncould potentially remove these assumptions and enable operation in unstructured, real-world scenarios.\nVII\nConclusion and Future Work\nWe presented a framework that enables robots to learn and execute navigation skills in real time through natural human interaction.\nBy reconstructing interaction scenes and augmenting data within these environments, our approach enables policies to robustly recover from distributional shifts across diverse interaction conditions.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively integrates verbal and gestural cues, enabling robust control across a range of tasks and environments.\nMoreover, our findings highlight the complementary nature of speech and gesture, showing that their combination provides a powerful interface for teaching and controlling robots to execute context-appropriate behaviors, including agile maneuvers such as jumping over obstacles.\nOverall, this work advances an intuitive and practical system that directly maps high-level human intent to executable robot actions.\nIn future work, we will explore extending our framework beyond navigation to more general whole-body behaviors, such as locomotion manipulation, by grounding multimodal commands using a similar data augmentation strategy.\nReferences\n[1]\nJ.

    "preview_text": "In this work, we aim to enable legged robots to learn how to interpret human social cues and produce appropriate behaviors through physical human guidance. However, learning through physical engagement can place a heavy burden on users when the process requires large amounts of human-provided data. To address this, we propose a human-in-the-loop framework that enables robots to acquire navigational behaviors in a data-efficient manner and to be controlled via multimodal natural human inputs, specifically gestural and verbal commands. We reconstruct interaction scenes using a physics-based simulation and aggregate data to mitigate distributional shifts arising from limited demonstration data. Our progressive goal cueing strategy adaptively feeds appropriate commands and navigation goals during training, leading to more accurate navigation and stronger alignment between human input and robot behavior. We evaluate our framework across six real-world agile navigation scenarios, including jumping over or avoiding obstacles. Our experimental results show that our proposed method succeeds in almost all trials across these scenarios, achieving a 97.15% task success rate with less than 1 hour of demonstration data in total.\n\nTeaching Robots Like Dogs: Learning Agile Navigation from Luring, Gesture, and Speech\nTaerim Yoon\n1\n,\nDongho Kang\n2\n,\nJin Cheng\n2\n,\nFatemeh Zargarbashi\n2\n,\nYijiang Huang\n2\n,\nMinsung Ahn\n3\n,\nStelian Coros\n2\n, and\nSungjoon Choi\n1\nCorresponding authors: Sungjoon Choi.\n1\nTaerim Yoon, and Sungjoon Choi are with the Department of Artificial Intelligence, Korea University, 145 Anam-ro, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, Korea (email: taerimyoon@korea.ac.kr; sungjoon-choi@korea.ac.kr).\n2\nDongho Kang, Jin Cheng, Fatemeh Zargarbashi, Yijiang Huang, and Stelian Coros are with the Department of Computer Science, ETH Zurich, Wasserwerkstrasse 12, 8092 Zurich, Switzerland (email: kangd@ethz.ch, jicheng@ethz.ch, fatemeh.zargarbashi@ethz.ch, huang@hey.com, scoros@ethz.ch).\n3\nMinsung A",

            "answer": "## 论文核心分析\n\n### **一、 研究目标与拟解决的核心问题**\n\n这篇论文旨在解决**如何让四足机器人像狗一样，通过自然的人类社交线索（如手势和语音）进行高效学习和敏捷导航**。具体而言，它针对以下两个核心挑战：\n\n1.  **交互的模糊性**：单一模态指令（如仅说“去那里”或仅做手势）存在歧义，难以精确传达用户意图。\n2.  **数据收集的高成本**：为学习复杂的多模态人机交互，收集大规模真实世界数据成本高昂，系统必须能够从**少量演示**中高效学习。\n\n### **二、 核心技术创新点**\n\n论文提出了一个名为 **LURE** 的整体框架，其创新点主要体现在以下三个方面：\n\n#### **1. 基于“诱导”的多模态人机交互教学与控制系统**\n- **灵感来源**：借鉴专业训犬师使用的“诱导”技术。\n- **方法**：用户使用一根教学杆**物理引导**机器人，同时配合发出**手势和语音命令**。这种方式能自然地产生多模态对齐的演示数据（`{手势， 语音， 目标位置}`）。\n- **价值**：将高层的用户意图（通过自然交互传达）直接映射到低层的机器人动作，实现了比遥杆或单一模态更直观、负担更轻的控制。\n\n#### **2. 基于仿真的数据聚合与增强技术**\n- **核心问题**：有限的演示数据会导致**分布偏移**，即训练数据分布与部署时遇到的状态分布不匹配，导致策略失败。\n- **解决方案**：\n    - **场景重建**：将真实世界收集的交互数据（地形、机器人状态、人类命令）在物理仿真器（如Isaac Gym）中精确重建。\n    - **数据聚合**：采用类似 **DAgger** 的算法，让当前策略在仿真中探索，并用一个**局部专家策略**（基于演示数据构建）来提供“纠正动作”，从而生成覆盖更广状态分布的新数据。\n    - **领域随机化**：在仿真中随机化机器人参数（质量、惯性）、施加外部扰动、随机缩放地形、添加干扰物体等，强制策略学习鲁棒的恢复能力。\n- **价值**：用**总计不到1小时**的演示数据，成功训练出在6种复杂导航场景中平均成功率高达 **97.15%** 的策略，实现了极高的**数据效率**。\n\n#### **3. 渐进式目标提示策略**\n- **问题**：在训练初期，策略执行慢，如果按原始时间戳回放人类命令，会导致命令与机器人当前状态**错位**（例如，新命令发出时，机器人还未完成上一个动作）。\n- **解决方案**：**Progressive Goal Cueing**。训练时，系统会等待机器人到达当前目标后，才提供下一个交互命令和导航目标。\n- **价值**：确保了训练过程中命令与行为的对齐，提供了更一致的监督信号，从而提升了导航精度和命令-行为的一致性。实验表明，该策略在DAgger基础上进一步将导航误差降低了15.2%。\n\n### **三、 解决方案架构总结**\n\n论文的解决方案是一个分层、数据驱动的管道：\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[**阶段0: 预备**] --> B[训练一个通用的低层**敏捷运动控制器**<br/>π_u: 跟踪任意速度指令];\n    B --> C[**阶段1: 数据收集**<br/>两人协作: 一人发令， 一人用杆“诱导”];\n    C --> D[获得多模态交互数据集 𝒟];\n    D --> E[**阶段2: 仿真训练**];\n    E --> F[在仿真中**重建交互场景**];\n    F --> G[应用**数据聚合** + **领域随机化**];\n    G --> H[应用**渐进式目标提示**];\n    H --> I[训练**高层导航策略** π_g<br/>输入: 手势+语音+状态+地图， 输出: 导航目标];\n    I --> J[**阶段3: 实时控制**<br/>用户通过自然手势和语音直接控制机器人];\n    J --> K[**结果**: 敏捷、鲁棒、意图对齐的导航];\n```\n\n### **四、 实际价值与意义**\n\n- **实用性**：为非专家用户提供了极其直观的机器人教学与控制接口，降低了使用门槛。\n- **高效性**：通过仿真数据聚合，极大减少了对昂贵、耗时的真实世界数据收集的依赖。\n- **鲁棒性**：策略能处理动态环境、用户差异（通过少量数据快速适应新用户），并能流畅组合多种技能（如绕行、跳跃、之字形行走）。\n- **学术贡献**：为**多模态人机交互**、**数据高效的模仿学习**以及**仿真到真实的迁移**提供了系统性的框架和实证验证，强调了**手势与语音的互补性**对于消除歧义、精准传达空间意图的关键作用。",

(2024)、Zafar et al. (2024) 等。\n*   **核心思想**：将一组**预定义的人类手势**直接映射到**离散的机器人动作**（如前进、左转、停止）。\n*   **改进与局限**：\n    *   **改进**：相比传统摇杆，提供了更直观的交互方式。\n    *   **局限**：\n        *   **表达能力有限**：离散动作无法实现精细、连续的控制。\n        *   **缺乏泛化能力**：无法处理预定义集合之外的命令或复杂环境。\n        *   **模态单一**：通常只使用手势**或**语音，未能融合多模态信息。\n\n#### 2. **发展阶段：连续控制与模仿学习**\n*   **代表性工作**：\n    *   **连续手势映射**：Xie et al. (2025) 将手部运动速度级联映射到机器人连续控制。\n    *   **模仿学习 (LfD) 应用**：Cuan et al. (2024) 使用模仿学习将用户手势映射为机器人动作。\n*   **核心思想**：追求更自然、更精细的**连续控制**，并利用**演示数据**学习行为策略，而非硬编码。\n*   **改进与局限**：\n    *   **改进**：\n        *   实现了更平滑、更拟人的机器人运动。\n        *   模仿学习降低了为复杂任务手工设计策略的难度。\n    *   **局限**：\n        *   **用户负担重**：连续映射仍需用户高度专注，进行“微操”，类似于高级摇杆控制，并未完全解放用户。\n        *   **数据效率与分布偏移**：纯模仿学习（如BC）严重依赖大量、高质量的演示数据，且容易因训练与部署状态分布不同（分布偏移）而性能骤降。\n        *   **语义模糊性**：例如，语音命令“去那里”缺乏空间 grounding。\n\n#### 3. **深化阶段：语言驱动导航与目标条件策略**\n*   **代表性工作**：\n    *   **语言-视觉-动作模型**：Cheng et al. (2025) 的NaVILA，通过文本指定导航目标。\n    *   **语言 grounding 导航**：Singh et al. (2022) 将自由形式语言指令（如“去床边”）转化为空间目标。\n    *   **潜空间语言控制**：Xue et al. (2025) 将视觉-语言表征嵌入人形机器人全身控制器。\n*   **核心思想**：利用**高级、抽象的语言指令**来驱动机器人，实现**目标导向**和**语义理解**的导航。\n*   **改进与局限**：\n    *   **改进**：\n        *   交互更符合人类习惯，无需学习特定控制信号。\n        *   能够处理更复杂、更抽象的指令。\n    *   **局限**：\n        *   **空间模糊性**：语言本身常缺乏精确的空间信息（如“那里”指代不明）。\n        *   **多技能与敏捷性**：早期工作多关注于平面移动导航，对四足机器人的**动态、敏捷行为**（如跳跃、绕行）支持有限。\n        *   **数据与泛化**：仍需大量交互数据，且对未见过的指令或用户泛化能力有限。\n\n#### 4. **融合与高效学习阶段：多模态交互与数据高效算法（本论文工作）**\n*   **代表性工作**：本文提出的 **LURE** 框架。\n*   **核心思想**：**融合语音与手势**以互补优势，并采用**数据高效**的学习框架，利用**少量演示**就能实现鲁棒的敏捷导航。\n*   **相对于前作的系统性改进**：\n\n| 对比维度 | 前作典型局限 | 本论文 (LURE) 的改进 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **交互模态** | **单模态为主**（仅手势或仅语言），存在模糊性或表达限制。 | **多模态融合**：语音提供任务语义（“做什么”），手势提供空间 grounding（“在哪里”），**互补解决模糊性**（见表II实验）。 |\n| **数据效率** | 需要**大量**真人演示数据，收集成本高。 | **数据高效**：提出 **“引诱-重建-聚合”** 流程。物理引导（引诱）收集少量数据 → 在物理仿真中**重建场景** → 利用 **DAgger式数据聚合** 和**领域随机化** 对抗分布偏移，用 **<1小时总数据** 学习6种技能。 |\n| **学习鲁棒性** | 模仿学习易受**分布偏移**影响，在偏离演示轨迹时失败。 | **仿真内数据聚合与增强**：在重建的仿真环境中，让策略在随机扰动下探索，并用**局部专家策略**提供纠正动作，**主动学习恢复能力**，大幅提升鲁棒性（图6，DAgger vs BC）。 |\n| **指令-行为对齐** | 训练时指令按固定时间戳播放，与学习中的机器人状态可能**错位**，导致监督信号混乱。 | **渐进式目标提示**：根据机器人当前状态（是否到达当前目标）动态推进指令，确保训练时**指令与机器人进度对齐**，从而学到更精确的行为（图6，LURE vs DAgger）。 |\n| **技能范围** | 多集中于**基础移动**或**室内导航**。 | **敏捷导航**：专注于四足机器人在杂乱环境中的**动态技能**，如“跳过去”、“绕过来”、“之字形”通过（图4），并与预训练的**低层敏捷运动控制器**解耦集成。 |\n| **用户适应性** | 通常假设用户风格一致，零样本泛化到新用户难。 | **快速用户适应**：基础模型在新用户上已有一定表现，仅需**平均4.5分钟**新数据微调，成功率平均提升 **22.11%**（表I），实现了**快速个性化**。 |\n\n### 着重发展的几个不同方向\n\n从脉络看，该领域主要沿三个核心方向深化：\n\n1.  **交互自然性与多模态融合方向**\n    *   **目标**：使人机交互无限接近人人交互。\n    *   **演进**：离散命令 → 连续控制 → 自然语言 → **多模态（语音+手势+视线等）融合**。本论文是此方向的典型代表，通过多模态解决了单一模态的固有缺陷。\n\n2.  **学习算法数据效率与鲁棒性方向**\n    *   **目标**：用尽可能少、成本低的真实数据，学到能应对现实世界变化的鲁棒策略。\n    *   **演进**：行为克隆（BC，数据饥渴） → 逆强化学习/对抗模仿学习（GAIL，不稳定） → **在线数据聚合（DAgger）** → **仿真重建 + 数据聚合 + 领域随机化**（本论文）。本论文将DAgger与**物理仿真场景重建**结合，创造了高效、安全的“数据制造厂”。\n\n3.  **任务复杂性与系统层级化方向**\n    *   **目标**：从简单任务扩展到复杂、动态的全身行为控制。\n    *   **演进**：平面导航 → 避障 → **动态敏捷运动（跑、跳）** → **分层架构（高层导航规划+低层运动执行）**。本论文采用了明确的分层架构（`π_g` 和 `π_u`），将**意图理解**与**敏捷执行**分离，使得高层交互策略可以专注于理解，而无需学习底层的复杂动力学。\n\n**总结**：本论文（LURE）站在了该发展脉络的当前前沿，它**系统性地整合了多模态交互、数据高效学习和分层敏捷控制**这三个关键方向上的先进思想，并通过**渐进式目标提示**等创新细节进行了优化，最终实现了一个**仅需少量演示、能通过自然方式控制四足机器人完成动态导航任务**的实用系统。其未来方向（如基于学习的动态人类模型、更通用的视觉感知、语义化手势表征）也清晰地指出了该领域下一步的突破点。",

DAgger** <br> Ross et al. (2011) [14] | **数据聚合算法**：一种模仿学习算法，通过迭代地让当前策略与环境交互，并查询专家提供这些新状态下的动作，来聚合数据，以解决分布偏移。 | - **目标提示机制**：在本文的DAgger基线中，交互命令（手势、语音）按照仿真时钟原样回放，**未考虑机器人当前状态**。<br>- **训练对齐**：当策略早期训练缓慢时，新的命令可能在机器人未完成上一个动作时就发出，导致**状态-命令错位**，产生不一致的监督信号。 | - **提出渐进式目标提示 (Progressive Goal Cuing)**：动态地根据机器人状态（是否到达当前目标）来提供下一个交互命令和导航目标。这确保了命令与机器人行为在训练过程中的强对齐。<br>- **结果**：在DAgger基础上，导航误差进一步降低15.2%，成功率提升13.7%。 |\n| **3. GAIL** <br> Ho & Ermon (2016) [9] | **生成对抗式模仿学习**：通过对抗训练，使策略生成的行为分布与专家演示分布匹配，旨在获得更好的泛化能力。 | - **训练稳定性**：GAIL因其对抗训练性质，常面临训练不稳定和模式坍塌的问题。<br>- **多技能性能**：在本文需要同时学习多种导航技能的场景下，GAIL的整体表现可能下降。 | - **采用更稳定、数据高效的学习框架**：结合了DAgger的数据聚合思想和精心设计的渐进式目标提示，避免了GAIL的不稳定性。<br>- **结果**：GAIL在最具挑战性的“之字形”任务上表现优于BC，但在所有技能上的平均成功率比BC低29.32%，而LURE取得了最佳性能。 |\n| **4. 单模态交互研究** <br> e.g., Xie et al. [22] (手势), <br> Cheng et al. [5] (语言) | **孤立使用手势或语言**：分别探索基于手势的连续控制或基于语言的导航，但未将两者在**实时**控制中深度融合。 | - **模态孤立**：仅使用单一模态，存在固有缺陷。<br>  - **仅手势**：需要用户持续关注和精细控制，类似摇杆。<br>  - **仅语言**：存在空间模糊性（如“去那里”需要额外线索）。<br>- **接口直观性**：未能像人类交流一样自然结合多种线索。 | - **提出统一的多模态实时交互接口**：**同时**利用手势和语音命令，让它们**互补**。<br>  - **手势**：提供空间 grounding（指向哪里）。<br>  - **语音**：提供语义意图（做什么，如“跳过去”）。<br>- **结果**：消融实验表明，双模态比仅用手势成功率平均高70.67%，比仅用语言导航误差低1.25米。 |\n| **5. 传统示教学习 (LfD) for Navigation** <br> e.g., Wu et al. [21], Singh et al. [17] | **从演示中学习导航**：从专家轨迹学习单目标或多技能导航，常使用环境特征图或 grounding 语言指令到空间目标。 | - **数据效率与分布偏移**：这些方法通常需要大量演示数据，且对由有限数据引起的分布偏移问题关注不足或解决方法不同。<br>- **物理交互与仿真利用**：较少涉及通过**物理引导（引诱）**收集数据，并在**物理仿真中重建场景**进行高效数据增强和训练。 | - **端到端的“引诱-仿真重建-训练”流程**：<br>  1. **引诱收集**：受训犬技术启发，用教学杆物理引导机器人，同时记录多模态命令，数据效率高（总数据<1小时）。<br>  2. **仿真重建与聚合**：在物理仿真中精确重建交互场景进行训练，结合**领域随机化**（质量、外力、地形缩放、干扰物）和**数据增强**（手势噪声、LLM生成同义语音），极大提升了策略的鲁棒性和泛化能力。 |\n\n### 总结：本文相对于前作的核心改进\n\n1.  **方法论创新**：创造了 **LURE** 框架，将 **“引诱式”物理人机交互数据收集**、**物理仿真场景重建**、**针对多模态交互的数据聚合与增强**，以及**渐进式目标提示**有机结合，形成了一个**数据高效**（<1小时数据）且**性能强大**（97.15%成功率）的闭环学习系统。\n\n2.  **技术点深化**：\n    *   **相对于BC/DAgger**：引入了**渐进式目标提示**，解决了交互训练中的时序对齐问题，这是对经典数据聚合算法在交互式场景下的重要改进。\n    *   **相对于单模态研究**：实证了**手势与语音在多模态接口中的互补性**，并构建了统一的实时处理管道。\n    *   **相对于传统LfD**：强调并系统化地解决了**小规模演示数据下的分布偏移问题**，通过仿真重建和一系列增强技术实现了强鲁棒性。\n\n3.  **实际价值提升**：使得非专业用户能够通过最自然的“手势+语音”方式，在**杂乱环境**中实时教导和控制四足机器人完成**敏捷导航**（如绕行、跳跃），大大降低了机器人操作的门槛，提高了人机交互的直观性和实用性。",

            "answer": "## 论文关键技术方法分析\n\n本文提出了一种名为 **LURE** 的人机交互框架，旨在通过少量演示数据，让四足机器人学习理解人类的多模态（手势和语音）社交线索，并执行敏捷导航任务。其核心技术创新在于**数据高效学习**和**多模态意图对齐**。\n\n以下是论文提出的关键技术方法及其详细技术细节：\n\n| 方法名称 | 核心目标 | 技术细节与数学原理 | 具体参数/实现 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **1. 基于“引诱”的数据收集** | 低成本获取多模态交互数据对 `(c, g*)`，其中 `c` 为交互指令（手势 `m` + 语音 `v`），`g*` 为期望导航目标。 | **原理**：模仿专业训犬师的“引诱”技术。由两名参与者协作：一人发出语音和手势指令，另一人使用教学杆物理引导机器人到达目标位置 `g*`。系统同步记录所有数据。 <br> **数学表示**：数据集合 `𝒟 = {v, m, ρ, x, g*}`。其中 `ρ` 为环境高度图，`x` 为机器人状态（位置、姿态、关节角及速度）。 | - 数据记录频率：**10 Hz**。 <br> - 总演示数据量：**< 1小时**（覆盖6个场景）。 <br> - 手势捕捉：使用 **OptiTrack Prime X22** 动作捕捉系统。 |\n| **2. 基于物理仿真的数据聚合** | 在仿真中重建交互场景，通过数据聚合（DAgger）缓解因演示数据有限导致的**分布偏移**问题，使策略能学习从错误中恢复。 | **原理**：在仿真中回放记录的场景（地形 `ρ`、指令 `c`）。定义**局部专家策略** `π̃_g`，它在机器人坐标系中生成指向全局目标 `g*` 的导航子目标 `g̃`。当当前策略 `π_g` 导致状态偏离演示分布时，`π̃_g` 提供纠正动作并加入聚合数据集。 <br> **数学优化目标**（简化）： <br> `arg min_π_g 𝔼_(c,x,ρ,g*)∼𝒟^π_g [ ‖ g* - π_g(c, x, ρ) ‖² ]` <br> 其中 `𝒟^π_g` 是当前策略访问的状态分布与专家动作的聚合数据集。 | **领域随机化参数**： <br> - 外力扰动：大小 `f ∈ [0, 0.5] m/s`，平均间隔 **3秒**。 <br> - 地形缩放：将地形分为 `3×3` 网格，每个网格缩放因子 `s ∈ [0.75, 1.25]`。 <br> - 二进制高度图阈值：`h_thres = 0.05 m`。 <br> - 添加干扰物：随机生成方形和圆形干扰物体。 |\n| **3. 渐进式目标提示** | 解决训练早期策略执行慢导致的**状态-指令错位**问题，确保在训练中提供的指令与机器人当前状态上下文对齐。 | **原理**：在仿真训练中，不严格按原始时间戳回放指令，而是根据机器人状态动态推进指令序列。当前导航目标达成后，才提供下一组交互指令 `c` 和导航目标 `g*`。这模拟了人类等待机器人完成动作后再发出新指令的合理交互模式。 <br> **算法逻辑**： <br> ``` if robot_reached_current_goal(): update_to_next_command_and_goal() else: hold_current_command() ``` | - 训练中，每个时间步以 **50% 概率** 应用渐进式提示，否则按仿真时钟推进。这平衡了对齐性与响应速度。 <br> - 随着策略性能提升，等待行为自然减少。 |\n| **4. 多模态输入增强** | 防止模型对有限的演示数据过拟合，提升对**语音指令多样性**和**手势噪声**的鲁棒性。 | **原理**： <br> **1. 手势增强**：对提取的人体关键点坐标添加高斯噪声，模拟姿态估计误差和人体运动自然波动。 <br> `m_augmented = m + ϵ_m, where ϵ_m ∼ 𝒩(0, 0.01)` <br> **2. 语音增强**：利用大语言模型（LLM）生成语义相同的多样化表达，替代原始语音指令文本。 | - 手势噪声方差：**0.01**。 <br> - 每条语音指令由LLM生成 **N_v = 20** 种替代表达，训练时随机采样。 <br> - 使用 **GPT-4** 作为LLM进行文本改写。 |\n| **5. 分层控制架构** | 解耦高层意图理解与底层敏捷运动执行，使系统模块化且易于训练。 | **原理**：将完整策略 `π` 分解为： <br> **高层导航模块 `π_g`**：作为“系统2”规划器，根据多模态指令 `c`、状态 `x` 和环境 `ρ`，预测机器人坐标系下的局部导航目标 `g`。 <br> `g = π_g(c, x, ρ)` <br> **底层运动控制器 `π_u`**：作为“系统1”反应式执行器，接收目标 `g`，输出电机扭矩 `u`，控制机器人完成跨越障碍等敏捷动作。 <br> `u = π_u(g, x, ρ)` <br> `π_u` 是预先训练好的，本文重点训练 `π_g`。 | - `π_u` 控制频率：**50 Hz**。 <br> - `π_u` 速度命令范围：线速度 `v_com ∈ [0.0, 1.0] m/s`，角速度 `w_com ∈ [-π/3, π/3] rad/s`。 <br> - 状态估计：融合编码器、足端接触和动捕数据的**卡尔曼滤波器**。 |\n| **6. 多模态表征与感知** | 将连续的语音和手势信号转化为可供神经网络处理的固定维度向量。 | **原理**： <br> **语音 `v`**：音频经 **Silero VAD** 分段，**Whisper** 转录为文本，再用预训练文本编码器（如 **Text Embeddings**）转换为向量。 <br> **手势 `m`**：基于6个上身关键点（双肩、双肘、双腕）的3D坐标，计算几何特征： <br> `m = [d_sh.r,el.r, d_el.r,wr.r, d_sh.l,el.l, d_el.l,wr.l, d_sh.l,sh.r, (p_sh.l + p_sh.r)^xy / 2, ϕ_h]` <br> 其中 `d` 是单位方向向量，最后一项 `ϕ_h` 是人体偏航角。 <br> **环境 `ρ`**：为导航模块 `π_g` 提供二值化障碍物掩码（阈值化高度图）。 | - 关键点坐标在**机器人坐标系**中表示。 <br> 高度图二值化阈值：`0.05 m`。 |\n\n**总结**：本文的核心技术贡献在于构建了一个**数据高效**的闭环学习框架。它通过**基于物理仿真的数据聚合**解决了小样本学习的分布偏移难题，并通过**渐进式目标提示**确保了训练信号的一致性。**多模态增强**提升了泛化能力，而**分层架构**则分离了复杂的意图理解与运动生成问题。这些方法共同使得机器人能够从不足一小时的真人演示中，学习理解并执行结合了手势和语音的复杂导航任务，最终在真实世界测试中达到了 **97.15%** 的成功率。",
