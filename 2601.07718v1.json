However, integrating exteroception remains a significant challenge: mapping-based methods suffer from state estimation drift; for instance, LiDAR-based methods do not handle torso jitter well. Existing end-to-end approaches often struggle with scalability and training complexity; specifically, some previous works using virtual obstacles are implemented case-by-case. In this work, we present\nHiking in the Wild\n, a scalable, end-to-end parkour perceptive framework designed for robust humanoid hiking. To ensure safety and training stability, we introduce two key mechanisms: a foothold safety mechanism combining scalable\nTerrain Edge Detection\nwith\nFoot Volume Points\nto prevent catastrophic slippage on edges, and a\nFlat Patch Sampling\nstrategy that mitigates reward hacking by generating feasible navigation targets. Our approach utilizes a single-stage reinforcement learning scheme, mapping raw depth inputs and proprioception directly to joint actions, without relying on external state estimation. Extensive field experiments on a full-size humanoid demonstrate that our policy enables robust traversal of complex terrains at speeds up to 2.5 m/s. The training and deployment code is open-sourced to facilitate reproducible research and deployment on real robots with minimal hardware modifications.\nI\nIntroduction\nHumanoid robots hold immense promise for traversing complex real-world environments and executing difficult tasks. Unlike their wheeled counterparts, humanoids can step over obstacles and navigate discontinuous terrain. Recently, the field has witnessed significant strides in humanoid control, enabling robots to perform dynamic maneuvers such as dancing, backflips, and mimicking human motions\n[\n22\n,\n24\n,\n27\n]\n. However, there is a fundamental distinction between tracking a predefined motion and hiking in the wild. While tracking resembles memorizing a routine, hiking requires the robot to actively perceive the terrain, adapt to irregularities, and handle the unknown.\nOver the past few years, blind locomotion has established a robust baseline\n[\n13\n,\n34\n,\n33\n,\n38\n]\n. Relying solely on proprioception, these methods are remarkably robust, capable of handling grass or gravel by reacting to contact forces. Yet, the reactive nature of blind locomotion imposes intrinsic limits. Since the robot only responds after a collision, it is vulnerable to significant hazards. Failure to perceive a deep gap or a high step can lead to catastrophic falls. To hike safely, a robot must transition from reactive stability to proactive planning by ”looking ahead.”\nIntegrating exteroceptive perception into locomotion remains a challenge. Existing approaches largely fall into two categories, each with critical bottlenecks. The first category relies on LiDAR to construct elevation maps (2.5D maps)\n[\n23\n,\n15\n]\nor voxel grids\n[\n3\n]\n, which depend heavily on precise state estimation. In the wild, however, position sensors are prone to drift. Additionally, LiDAR typically has low frequency and suffers from motion distortion, limiting performance in highly dynamic tasks and environments. Other works utilize depth images to reconstruct heightmap\n[\n7\n,\n40\n,\n39\n]\n, which are not scalable on unseen wild environments. They are limited to low-speed movements on simple structures like planes and stairs. Lastly, due to highly customized configurations (e.g. camera position), the code is often not open-sourced, making these methods difficult to scale and reproduce by the community.\nTo address these challenges, we present\nHiking in the Wild\n, a scalable, end-to-end perceptive parkour framework designed for robust humanoid locomotion in unstructured environments. Unlike complex modular pipelines, our approach leverages a single-stage reinforcement learning scheme that maps raw depth inputs and proprioception directly to joint actions. To handle the high dimensionality of visual data and the complexity of diverse terrain skills, we incorporate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture\n[\n17\n,\n16\n]\n. Our design allows the policy to process depth inputs at high frequencies (up to 60 Hz). This high-bandwidth perception loop enables the robot to perform dynamic obstacle traversal and high-speed running (up to 2.5 m/s). Crucially, our system incorporates a realistic depth synthesis module that models sensor noise and artifacts during training, enabling zero-shot Sim-to-Real transfer without external localization systems.\nA critical yet often overlooked issue in humanoid RL is the precision of foothold placement. Unlike quadrupeds, humanoids are less stable, and stepping partially on an edge (e.g., the lip of a stair) often leads to catastrophic slippage. Previous model-based planners can generate precise footholds but are fragile to map errors\n[\n18\n]\n. We propose a robust soft-constraint mechanism: a geometric\nTerrain Edge Detector\ncoupled with\nVolume Points\nattached to the robot’s feet. Some previous works using virtual obstacles are not scalable\n[\n50\n,\n4\n]\n. By penalizing the penetration of these volume points with terrain edges during training, the policy implicitly learns to center its feet on safe, flat surfaces, significantly enhancing safety on stairs and gaps without requiring explicit trajectory planning.\nFurthermore, training robust policies for the wild is complicated by the ”reward hacking” phenomenon, where agents tasked with random velocity commands often learn to spin in place rather than traverse difficult terrain\n[\n4\n]\n. Some methods using a goal-based command alleviate this problem, but they lack control over speed of the robot\n[\n47\n,\n48\n]\n. To enforce meaningful exploration, we introduce a\nFlat Patch Sampling\nstrategy. Instead of arbitrary commands, we identify reachable flat regions in the terrain mesh to serve as feasible navigation targets. Velocity commands are then generated based on the relative position of these patches, with randomized speed limits. This curriculum ensures that the agent is always challenged with physically solvable tasks, accelerating convergence and improving directional compliance.\nWe validate our framework on a humanoid robot through extensive field experiments. The robot successfully completed hiking tasks in the wild, robustly traversing stairs, slopes, uneven grassy ground, and discrete gaps. Our system not only demonstrates the ability to navigate previously unseen environments but also achieves high-speed locomotion agility. The contributions of this work are summarized as follows:\n1.\nA scalable, single-stage end-to-end perceptive training and deployment framework, enabling zero-shot Sim-to-Real transfer without external state estimation.\n2.\nA novel safety mechanism using Terrain Edge Detection and Foot Volume Points, alleviating the precise foothold problem in learning-based control.\n3.\nA position-based velocity command generation method leveraging Flat Patch Sampling, eliminating reward hacking and ensuring robust navigation behaviors.\n4.\nDemonstration of robust wild hiking capabilities in a humanoid. The training and deployment code is open-sourced to the community, enabling deployment on real robots with minimal hardware modifications.\nII\nRelated Works\nFigure 1:\nSystem overview. Our framework trains an end-to-end policy using simulated depth and proprioception. To ensure safety and agility on complex terrains, we incorporate Scalable Edge Penalization to avoid risky footholds and Position-based Command generation for precise tracking. The trained policy is directly deployed to the real robot (Zero-shot) using only a 60 Hz onboard depth camera as exteroception, achieving extremely high-dynamic locomotion without explicit localization or map reconstruction.\nII-A\nLearning-based Legged Locomotion\nLegged locomotion control has shifted from model-based approaches, such as Model Predictive Control (MPC)\n[\n10\n,\n37\n,\n20\n]\n, to data-driven Reinforcement Learning (RL) to better handle unmodeled dynamics. Early blind RL policies achieved impressive robustness on irregular terrains using only proprioception\n[\n34\n,\n38\n,\n13\n,\n46\n]\n. However, these methods lack the exteroception required to navigate large obstacles fast and safely.\nTo enable more agile ability, recent works have integrated exteroceptive perception into the control loop\n[\n4\n,\n35\n]\n. One category of methods relies on LidAR to build elevation maps (2.5D)\n[\n15\n,\n23\n,\n41\n]\nor voxel grids\n[\n3\n]\n. Nevertheless, these approaches depend heavily on precise localization, which limits their update frequency and overall robustness. Furthermore, LiDAR often suffers from motion distortion during fast movement, restricting these methods to low-speed scenarios. Alternatively, depth-image-based methods have been proposed. Some of these operate at low frequency\n[\n50\n]\n, while others employ intermediate modules to predict height maps\n[\n7\n,\n40\n,\n39\n]\n, potentially compromising performance in high-speed or unseen wild environments. In contrast, our method directly utilizes high-frequency depth images as input to train an end-to-end policy, achieving exceptionally high-dynamic behaviors across complex, unstructured terrains in the wild.\nII-B\nPerceptive Foothold Control\nExplicit foothold control typically decouples perception and planning, utilizing terrain representations like elevation maps to solve for optimal placements. Approaches range from heuristic search\n[\n44\n,\n8\n,\n19\n,\n21\n,\n6\n,\n30\n,\n1\n]\nand learned feasibility costs\n[\n26\n,\n45\n,\n28\n,\n43\n]\nto rigorous nonlinear optimization\n[\n12\n,\n29\n]\n. While hybrid frameworks utilizing probabilistic map uncertainty\n[\n19\n,\n9\n]\nor combining pre-planned references with online tracking\n[\n18\n,\n11\n]\nhave achieved impressive agility, they remain brittle to state estimation drift and reconstruction artifacts. Recently, end-to-end policies\n[\n4\n]\nuses edge penalization to implicitly learn safe foothold. However, it’s not scalable to arbitary meshes. Our method takes a trimesh as input and automatically detects the edges, retains the robustness of the implicit paradigm while enforcing safety.\nIII\nMethod\nFigure 2:\nDepth processing: Top row shows\nℱ\ns\n​\ni\n​\nm\n\\mathcal{F}_{sim}\non synthetic data, and bottom row shows\nℱ\nr\n​\ne\n​\na\n​\nl\n\\mathcal{F}_{real}\non real-world data.\nIII-A\nProblem Formulation\nThe problem of perceptive humanoid locomotion is formulated as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). We leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize the locomotion policy. Specifically, the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)\n[\n36\n]\nalgorithm—a robust actor-critic framework—is employed for policy training. The key components of our MDP formulation, including the observation space, action space, termination criteria, and reward functions, are defined as follows:\nIII-A\n1\nObservation Space\nThe observation space is formulated to provide the policy with sufficient state information for stable locomotion. Specifically, the actor’s observation comprises both proprioceptive and perceptive signals, including base angular velocity\n𝝎\nt\n∈\nℝ\n3\n\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}\n, projected gravity vector\n𝐠\nt\n∈\nℝ\n3\n\\mathbf{g}_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}\n, velocity commands\n𝐜\nt\n∈\nℝ\n3\n\\mathbf{c}_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}\n, joint positions\n𝐪\nt\n∈\nℝ\n29\n\\mathbf{q}_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{29}\n, joint velocities\n𝐪\n˙\nt\n∈\nℝ\n29\n\\dot{\\mathbf{q}}_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{29}\n, last action\n𝐚\nt\n−\n1\n∈\nℝ\n29\n\\mathbf{a}_{t-1}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{29}\n, and depth images\n𝐈\nt\n∈\nℝ\nW\n×\nH\n\\mathbf{I}_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{W\\times H}\n. To capture temporal dependencies, we employ a sliding window of history consisting of\nh\nh\nsteps. During training, the actor’s input is subject to stochastic noise to improve robustness and bridge the sim-to-real gap. The comprehensive actor observation\n𝐨\nt\na\n\\mathbf{o}_{t}^{a}\nis defined as:\n𝐨\nt\na\n=\n{\n(\n𝝎\ni\n,\n𝐠\ni\n,\n𝐜\ni\n,\n𝐪\ni\n,\n𝐪\n˙\ni\n,\n𝐚\ni\n−\n1\n)\n}\ni\n=\nt\n−\nh\n+\n1\nt\n+\nℋ\nt\n\\mathbf{o}_{t}^{a}=\\left\\{\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_{i},\\mathbf{g}_{i},\\mathbf{c}_{i},\\mathbf{q}_{i},\\dot{\\mathbf{q}}_{i},\\mathbf{a}_{i-1}\\right)\\right\\}_{i=t-h+1}^{t}+\\mathcal{H}_{t}\n(1)\nwhere\nℋ\nt\n\\mathcal{H}_{t}\nis the historical input sequence of depth images. We adopt an asymmetric actor-critic architecture to facilitate training in simulation. The critic’s observation\n𝐨\nt\nc\n\\mathbf{o}_{t}^{c}\nincludes all noise-free actor observations, combined with base linear velocity\n𝐯\nt\n∈\nℝ\n3\n\\mathbf{v}_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}\n.\nIII-A\n2\nAction Space\nThe policy outputs the target joint positions\n𝐚\nt\n∈\nℝ\n29\n\\mathbf{a}_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{29}\n. Then, the joint torques\n𝝉\nt\n\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{t}\nare computed via PD control:\n𝝉\nt\n=\nk\np\n​\n(\n𝐚\nt\n−\n𝐪\nt\n)\n−\nk\nd\n​\n𝐪\n˙\nt\n\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{t}=k_{p}(\\mathbf{a}_{t}-\\mathbf{q}_{t})-k_{d}\\dot{\\mathbf{q}}_{t}\n(2)\nThe specific PD gain values are adopted from\nBeyondMimic\n[\n22\n]\n. These computed torques are then applied to the robot’s actuators to execute the desired motion.\nIII-A\n3\nTermination Criteria\nAn episode is terminated upon (i) time-out, (ii) exceeding terrain boundaries, (iii) illegal torso contact, (iv) unstable orientation, or (v) insufficient root height. These constraints prevent the exploration of physically unfeasible states and accelerate training convergence.\nIII-A\n4\nReward Functions\nThe total reward\nR\nR\nis defined as the sum of four primary components: task, regularization, safety, and AMP-style rewards. Formally,\nR\n=\nr\ntask\n+\nr\nreg\n+\nr\nsafe\n+\nr\namp\nR=r_{\\text{task}}+r_{\\text{reg}}+r_{\\text{safe}}+r_{\\text{amp}}\n. These terms respectively facilitate command tracking, energy efficiency, constraint satisfaction, and natural locomotion styles.\nIII-B\nEgo-centric Depth Simulation\nIII-B\n1\nEfficient Depth Synthesis via Parallelized Ray-casting\nTo synthesize high-fidelity depth observations, we leverage the NVIDIA Warp framework\n[\n25\n]\nto implement a GPU-accelerated ray-caster. Given the camera’s extrinsic parameters—comprising the optical center position\n𝐩\nc\n∈\nℝ\n3\n\\mathbf{p}_{c}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}\nand orientation matrix\n𝐑\nc\n∈\nS\n​\nO\n​\n(\n3\n)\n\\mathbf{R}_{c}\\in SO(3)\n—we cast a set of rays corresponding to the camera’s intrinsic manifold.\nFor each pixel\n(\ni\n,\nj\n)\n(i,j)\nin the image plane, a ray is emitted in the direction\n𝐯\ni\n,\nj\n\\mathbf{v}_{i,j}\n. The ray-caster computes the radial distance\nd\ni\n,\nj\nd_{i,j}\nby identifying the first intersection point between the ray and the scene geometry\n𝒢\n\\mathcal{G}\n, which includes both the terrain environment and the robot’s visual meshes:\nd\ni\n,\nj\n=\nmin\n⁡\n{\nτ\n∣\n𝐩\nc\n+\nτ\n​\n𝐯\ni\n,\nj\n∩\n𝒢\n≠\n∅\n}\nd_{i,j}=\\min\\{\\tau\\mid\\mathbf{p}_{c}+\\tau\\mathbf{v}_{i,j}\\cap\\mathcal{G}\\neq\\emptyset\\}\nTo accurately emulate the output of physical RGB-D sensors, we transform the radial distance\nd\ni\n,\nj\nd_{i,j}\ninto the orthogonal depth\nz\ni\n,\nj\nz_{i,j}\n. This is achieved by projecting the distance onto the camera’s principal axis\n𝐧\nc\n\\mathbf{n}_{c}\n:\nz\ni\n,\nj\n=\nd\ni\n,\nj\n⋅\n(\n𝐯\ni\n,\nj\n⋅\n𝐧\nc\n)\nz_{i,j}=d_{i,j}\\cdot(\\mathbf{v}_{i,j}\\cdot\\mathbf{n}_{c})\nwhere\n𝐯\ni\n,\nj\n\\mathbf{v}_{i,j}\nis the unit ray direction and\n𝐧\nc\n\\mathbf{n}_{c}\nis the camera’s forward-facing unit vector. This parallelized approach ensures real-time synthesis of dense depth maps within the simulation loop.\nIII-B\n2\nBidirectional Depth Alignment and Noise Modeling\nTo minimize the sim-to-real gap, we define two transformation pipelines,\nℱ\ns\n​\ni\n​\nm\n\\mathcal{F}_{sim}\nand\nℱ\nr\n​\ne\n​\na\n​\nl\n\\mathcal{F}_{real}\n, which map raw depth observations from their respective domains into a unified perception space\n𝒪\n\\mathcal{O}\n. Our objective is to ensure that the processed distributions are harmonized, such that\nP\n​\n(\nℱ\ns\n​\ni\n​\nm\n​\n(\nd\ns\n​\ni\n​\nm\n)\n)\n≈\nP\n​\n(\nℱ\nr\n​\ne\n​\na\n​\nl\n​\n(\nd\nr\n​\ne\n​\na\n​\nl\n)\n)\nP(\\mathcal{F}_{sim}(d_{sim}))\\approx P(\\mathcal{F}_{real}(d_{real}))\n, where\nd\n∈\nℝ\nH\n×\nW\nd\\in\\mathbb{R}^{H\\times W}\ndenotes the raw depth map.\nSimulation Pipeline\nℱ\ns\n​\ni\n​\nm\n\\mathcal{F}_{sim}\nThe simulation pipeline degrades ideal depth to emulate physical sensor limitations through the following sequential stochastic operations:\n1.\nCrop and Resize\n: The raw depth map is cropped and rescaled to the target resolution to focus on the key features at the center of the image.\n2.\nRange-dependent Gaussian Noise\n: To account for precision decay, additive Gaussian noise\nϵ\n∼\n𝒩\n​\n(\n0\n,\nσ\n2\n)\n\\epsilon\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^{2})\nis injected into pixels within a valid sensing range\n[\nd\nm\n​\ni\n​\nn\n,\nd\nm\n​\na\n​\nx\n]\n[d_{min},d_{max}]\n. The perturbed depth\nz\ni\n,\nj\n′\nz^{\\prime}_{i,j}\nis defined as:\nz\ni\n,\nj\n′\n=\n{\nz\ni\n,\nj\n+\nϵ\n,\nif\n​\nz\ni\n,\nj\n∈\n[\nd\nm\n​\ni\n​\nn\n,\nd\nm\n​\na\n​\nx\n]\nz\ni\n,\nj\n,\notherwise\nz^{\\prime}_{i,j}=\\begin{cases}z_{i,j}+\\epsilon,&\\text{if }z_{i,j}\\in[d_{min},d_{max}]\\\\\nz_{i,j},&\\text{otherwise}\\end{cases}\n3.\nDisparity Artifact Synthesis\n: To simulate binocular matching failures (e.g., in over-exposed or textureless regions), we mask contiguous pixels as invalid ”white regions” using structural masks.\n4.\nGaussian Blur\n: A Gaussian blur kernel\n𝐊\n\\mathbf{K}\nis convolved with the image to simulate optical motion blur.\n5.\nClip and Normalization\nValues are clipped and normalized to\n[\n0\n,\n1\n]\n[0,1]\n.\n6.\nOut-of-Distribution (OOD) Perturbation\n: To enhance robustness against brief obstructions or temporary sensor glitches, we introduce a Bernoulli-distributed dropout. With a probability\nP\no\n​\no\n​\nd\nP_{ood}\n, the entire observation is replaced by random gaussian noise, forcing the policy to handle transient perceptual failures.\nReal-world Pipeline\nℱ\nr\n​\ne\n​\na\n​\nl\n\\mathcal{F}_{real}\nDuring deployment, the physical depth stream is refined to match the characteristics of the trained policy’s input space:\n1.\nCrop and Resize\n: The raw stream is cropped and resized to ensure the input manifold is consistent with the simulation geometry.\n2.\nDepth Inpainting\n: Physical sensors often exhibit ”black regions” (zero-valued pixels) due to occlusion or disparity shadows. We apply a spatial inpainting operator to recover these missing depth values.\n3.\nGaussian Blur\n: A Gaussian blur is applied to suppress high-frequency sensor jitter and electronic noise.\nIII-B\n3\nTemporal Depth Aggregation via Strided Sampling\nTo enhance policy robustness, particularly during high-speed locomotion where rapid terrain changes necessitate a broader temporal context, we incorporate a long-term history of depth observations. Unlike proprioceptive states that typically utilize a dense history of the last\nn\nn\nconsecutive steps, the depth input employs a strided temporal sampling strategy to balance the look-back window with computational efficiency.\nSpecifically, we define a history buffer consisting of\nm\nm\nframes sampled with a temporal stride\nℓ\n\\ell\n. Furthermore, a single-frame delay is introduced during training to emulate physical sensor latency. Let\nI\nt\nI_{t}\ndenote the depth image at current time step\nt\nt\n. The historical input sequence\nℋ\nt\n\\mathcal{H}_{t}\nis formulated as:\nℋ\nt\n=\n{\nI\nt\n−\nk\n⋅\nℓ\n∣\nk\n=\n0\n,\n1\n,\n…\n,\nm\n−\n1\n}\n\\mathcal{H}_{t}=\\{I_{t-k\\cdot\\ell}\\mid k=0,1,\\dots,m-1\\}\nwhere\nk\nk\nis the frame index. This configuration allows the policy to perceive a total temporal horizon of\n(\nm\n−\n1\n)\n⋅\nℓ\n(m-1)\\cdot\\ell\nsteps while only processing\nm\nm\ndiscrete frames.\nBy utilizing this sparse yet extended temporal representation, the agent can effectively capture the trend of the terrain profile and the robot’s relative velocity without the redundant information overlap inherent in consecutive high-frequency frames. This strided history proves critical for anticipating obstacles and adjusting gait during high-speed maneuvers.\nIII-C\nTerrain Edge Contact Penalization\nDuring training, the robot tends to step close to the edge to minimize energy usage\n[\n4\n]\n. However, Stepping only partially on terrain edges, such as the edge of a stair, can make the robot unstable and lead to falls. To improve safety, we penalize the robot’s feet contacts near terrain edges. First, we use an edge detector to find the boundaries of the terrain mesh. Second, we attach a set of ”volume points” to the robot’s feet. By penalizing these points when they penetrate the edge, the policy learns to select more stable, centered foot positions rather than risky ones.\nIII-C\n1\nTerrain Edge Detector\nFirst, we identify sharp terrain edges by comparing the dihedral angle between adjacent faces to a predefined threshold\nτ\n\\tau\n. To enhance computational efficiency, the resulting raw edges are further processed to filter noise and concatenate short segments.

We leverage NVIDIA Warp\n[\n25\n]\nto perform massively parallel distance queries, computing the penetration depth of each point relative to the previously constructed spatial collision grid\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\n.\nTo discourage unstable foot-ground interactions near terrain edges, we define a penalty term that considers both the geometric penetration and the dynamic state of the foot following\n[\n49\n]\n.

This formulation ensures that the policy is penalized more heavily for high-velocity impacts or scraping motions near terrain edges, thereby encouraging the robot to seek stable footholds.\nIII-D\nPosition-based Velocity Command\nDuring training, conventional velocity commands that are sampled uniformly often lead to ”reward hacking,” where the robot turns in circles to collect rewards instead of actually crossing obstacles\n[\n4\n]\n. Previous research has attempted to solve this by modifying velocity tracking rewards\n[\n4\n,\n5\n]\nor using goal-based commands\n[\n47\n,\n48\n]\n. However, relying only on reward tuning with randomly sampled commands makes it difficult to reach maximum performance. Furthermore, pure goal commands often lack control over the robot’s speed, and randomly sampled goals may not provide suitable targets. To address these issues, we introduce a new method that generates targets using ”flat patches” and creates specific velocity commands to improve training performance.\nIII-D\n1\nTarget Generation via Flat Patch\nFollowing the approach in IsaacLab\n[\n31\n]\n, we identify ”flat patches” on the terrain mesh to serve as reachable navigation targets. A location is considered a valid target if the terrain within a radius\nr\nr\nis sufficiently level. Specifically, we sample potential locations and use ray-casting to check the height difference of the surrounding terrain. A patch is accepted only if the maximum height difference is below a threshold\nδ\n\\delta\n. This ensures that targets are placed on stable ground rather than steep slopes or unreachable areas. An example can be found in\nFigure 5\n.\nInput :\nMesh\nℳ\n\\mathcal{M}\n, Patch radius\nr\nr\n, Max height difference\nδ\n\\delta\nOutput :\nSet of valid targets\n𝒫\n\\mathcal{P}\n1\n2\n1ex\nwhile\n|\n𝒫\n|\n<\nN\nt\n​\na\n​\nr\n​\ng\n​\ne\n​\nt\n​\ns\n|\\mathcal{P}|<N_{targets}\ndo\n3\n1.

The robot’s velocity commands are then generated based on the relative position of this target. Let\n𝐩\nt\n​\na\n​\nr\n​\ng\n​\ne\n​\nt\nB\n=\n[\nx\ng\n,\ny\ng\n]\nT\n\\mathbf{p}_{target}^{B}=[x_{g},y_{g}]^{T}\nrepresent the target position in the robot’s base frame. The desired linear velocity\nv\nx\nv_{x}\nand angular velocity\nω\nz\n\\omega_{z}\nare calculated as follows:\nv\nx\n\\displaystyle v_{x}\n=\nclip\n​\n(\nk\nv\n⋅\nx\ng\n,\n0\n,\nv\nm\n​\na\n​\nx\n)\n\\displaystyle=\\text{clip}(k_{v}\\cdot x_{g},0,v_{max})\n(4)\nω\nz\n\\displaystyle\\omega_{z}\n=\nclip\n​\n(\nk\nω\n⋅\natan2\n​\n(\ny\ng\n,\nx\ng\n)\n,\n−\nω\nm\n​\na\n​\nx\n,\nω\nm\n​\na\n​\nx\n)\n\\displaystyle=\\text{clip}(k_{\\omega}\\cdot\\text{atan2}(y_{g},x_{g}),-\\omega_{max},\\omega_{max})\n(5)\nwhere\nk\nv\nk_{v}\nand\nk\nω\nk_{\\omega}\nare the linear and angular stiffness (gain) coefficients. Because we use the forward camera on robot’s head link, we only focus on forward locomotion and heading alignment; therefore, the lateral velocity command\nv\ny\nv_{y}\nis set to zero. The velocity limits\n(\nv\nm\n​\na\n​\nx\n,\nω\nm\n​\na\n​\nx\n)\n(v_{max},\\omega_{max})\nare adaptively adjusted based on the category of the terrain.\nHowever, relying solely on these position-based commands can limit the robot’s ability to learn in-place turning, as the target is usually far away. To address this, we assign a small subset of agents on flat terrain to receive pure turning commands. For these agents, we set\nv\nx\n=\n0\nv_{x}=0\nand provide a random\nω\nz\n\\omega_{z}\n, forcing the policy to learn effective in-place rotation maneuvers. This combination improves the overall maneuverability of the robot across different environments.\nIII-E\nPolicy Training with Adversarial Motion Priors\nFollowing previous works\n[\n42\n,\n40\n]\n, we use the Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP) framework\n[\n32\n]\nto improve the robot’s gait style and overall locomotion ability. Our reference dataset\n𝒟\n\\mathcal{D}\nis collected at a frequency of\nf\n=\n50\n​\nHz\nf=50\\,\\text{Hz}\nfrom three primary sources:\n1.\nSynthetic Data\n: Walking patterns generated by a Model Predictive Control (MPC) controller\n[\n10\n]\nto provide stable movement.\n2.\nHuman Motion\n: High-quality human data captured via the NOKOV motion capture system.\n3.\nRunning Motion\n: High-speed running motions selected from the LAFAN dataset\n[\n14\n]\n.\nThe human motions specifically include challenging tasks such as climbing onto/off high platforms and ascending/descending stairs. We use GMR\n[\n2\n]\nto retarget these human trajectories into robot motions.\nTo avoid the “mode collapse” problem, we train the walking and running policies separately using different datasets. The walking dataset\n𝒟\nwalk\n\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{walk}}\ncombines sources 1 and 2, totaling\nT\n=\n379.62\n​\ns\nT=379.62\\,\\text{s}\nof motion data. The running dataset\n𝒟\nrun\n\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{run}}\nconsists of source 3, with a total duration of\nT\n=\n1.54\n​\ns\nT=1.54\\,\\text{s}\n. This multi-source approach allows the policy to learn both the stability of MPC and the natural agility of human-like movement.\nUnlike previous works that only use a single state pair\n(\n𝐬\nt\n,\n𝐬\nt\n+\n1\n)\n(\\mathbf{s}_{t},\\mathbf{s}_{t+1})\nas the transition for the discriminator, we use a short sequence of past states to better capture the motion’s temporal features. The transition is defined as\n(\n𝐒\nt\n,\n𝐒\nt\n+\n1\n)\n(\\mathbf{S}_{t},\\mathbf{S}_{t+1})\n, where\n𝐒\nt\n=\n[\n𝐬\nt\n−\nn\n,\n…\n,\n𝐬\nt\n]\n\\mathbf{S}_{t}=[\\mathbf{s}_{t-n},\\dots,\\mathbf{s}_{t}]\nrepresents a history of\nn\nn\nframes.\n𝐬\nt\n=\n{\n(\n𝐯\nt\n,\n𝝎\nt\n,\n𝐠\nt\n,\n𝐪\nt\n,\n𝐪\n˙\nt\n)\n}\n\\mathbf{s}_{t}=\\left\\{\\left(\\mathbf{v}_{t},\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_{t},\\mathbf{g}_{t},\\mathbf{q}_{t},\\dot{\\mathbf{q}}_{t}\\right)\\right\\}\n(6)\nTo increase the diversity of the motion data, we also apply symmetric augmentation to the dataset. Following the AMP framework, the discriminator\nD\n​\n(\n𝐒\n)\nD(\\mathbf{S})\nis trained using a least-squares (MSE) loss:\nL\nD\n=\n𝔼\nℳ\n​\n[\n(\nD\n​\n(\n𝐒\n)\n−\n1\n)\n2\n]\n+\n𝔼\n𝒫\n​\n[\n(\nD\n​\n(\n𝐒\n)\n+\n1\n)\n2\n]\nL_{D}=\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathcal{M}}[(D(\\mathbf{S})-1)^{2}]+\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathcal{P}}[(D(\\mathbf{S})+1)^{2}]\n(7)\nwhere\nℳ\n\\mathcal{M}\nrepresents the reference motion dataset and\n𝒫\n\\mathcal{P}\nrepresents the motions produced by the current policy. To ensure training stability, we incorporate gradient penalty and weight decay. The style-reward\nr\nt\nr_{t}\nprovided by the discriminator to the policy is calculated as:\nr\nt\n=\nmax\n⁡\n[\n0\n,\n1\n−\n0.25\n​\n(\nD\n​\n(\n𝐒\nt\n)\n−\n1\n)\n2\n]\nr_{t}=\\max\\left[0,1-0.25(D(\\mathbf{S}_{t})-1)^{2}\\right]\n(8)\nCompared to the binary cross-entropy loss and log-based rewards, the combination of MSE loss and quadratic rewards provides smoother, non-saturating gradients that prevent the vanishing gradient problem and ensure more stable convergence toward the reference motion manifold.\nIV\nExperiments\nIn this section, we evaluate the robustness and performance of our framework through extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world environments. We test the policy across various challenging terrains, including stairs, high platforms, grassy ramps, and discrete gaps, using both walking and running gaits. Our evaluation aims to answer the following three questions:\n•\nQ1\n: Does our framework enable efficient training and reliable zero-shot deployment on physical hardware?\n•\nQ2\n: Does the edge-aware penalization mechanism improve foothold safety and stability when traversing discrete terrain features? Is it scalable to new terrains without any extra design?\n•\nQ3\n: What are the individual contributions of the key design components (e.g., perception, AMP, or command generation) to the robot’s performance?\nIV-A\nExperiment Configurations\nTraining Environment:\nWe train our policies using NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab\n[\n31\n]\n. All training sessions are conducted on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU. We utilize the 29-DoF Unitree G1 humanoid robot for both simulation training and physical deployment. The history length for prioception and depth image is 8 frames.\nHardware and Perception:\nFor real-world deployment, we utilize the factory-integrated Intel RealSense D435i depth camera that comes standard with the Unitree G1 without any hardware modification. Depth images are captured at 60 Hz with a raw resolution of\n480\n×\n270\n480\\times 270\n, which are then downsampled to\n64\n×\n36\n64\\times 36\nand cropped to a final input size of\n36\n×\n18\n36\\times 18\nfor the policy.\nOnboard Deployment:\nThe policy operates at a frequency of 50 Hz on the robot’s onboard NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX. We utilize\nonnxruntime\nfor efficient policy inference. To ensure low-latency performance, depth acquisition and image processing are handled in a dedicated asynchronous process at 60 Hz. The base policy is post-trained for high-speed running and some specific terrains.\nIV-B\nReal-world Deployment\nFigure 6:\nSnapshots of the humanoid robot traversing diverse indoor and outdoor environments via zero-shot transfer: (a) running ascent onto a high platform; (b) running descent from a high platform; (c) running on a grassy slope; (d) stair ascent; (e) stair descent; (f) traversing a deep gap.\nWe highly recommend watching videos in the supplementary materials for better demonstration.\nWe evaluate our framework by deploying the trained policies directly onto the humanoid robot via zero-shot sim-to-real transfer. As illustrated in\nFigure 6\n, the robot successfully performs various locomotion primitives across challenging terrains. Notably, the robot achieves a maximum running speed of\n2.5\n​\nm/s\n2.5~\\text{m/s}\nand successfully traversed difficult obstacles, including high platforms up to\n32\n​\ncm\n32~\\text{cm}\nand discrete gaps with a width of\n50\n​\ncm\n50~\\text{cm}\n.\nCrucially, the high-frequency depth perception (60 Hz) is the key enabler for these high-dynamic tasks, such as running onto a high platform. The low-latency environmental feedback allows the policy to make rapid adjustments to the robot’s posture and terrain changes in real-time.\nTo quantify the system’s reliability, we conduct 10 trials for each combination of terrain and gait. The resulting success rates are summarized in\nFigure 7\n. Our policy maintains a high success rate across nearly all tested scenarios, demonstrating remarkable robustness to real-world sensory noise and physical discrepancies.\nFigure 7:\nSuccess rates across different terrains and modes.\nFurthermore, we conduct a long duration test to evaluate the stability of the system over a prolonged period. The robot is tasked with continuous locomotion across multiple staircases and flat surfaces. The robot successfully maintains its balance and walks for 4 minutes without any falls or human intervention. This sustained performance highlights the effectiveness of our control framework and its potential for deployment in complex, long-range real-world tasks.\nIV-C\nEdge-aware Penalization Mechanism\nAs introduced in\nsubsection\nIII-C\n, we utilize the\nTerrain Edge Detector\nand\nVolumetric Point Penetration Penalization\nto ensure foothold safety. As illustrated in\nFigure 8\n, with edge-aware penalization enabled, the robot tends to seek higher safety margins, effectively placing its feet away from terrain edges to maintain stable contact.\nFigure 8:\nVisualization of foothold placement.\nTo quantitatively evaluate this effect, we measure the\nSuccess Rate\nand\nMean Feet Landing Area Percentage\nin simulation across various challenging terrains. Landing Area quantifies the portion of the foot manifold that is on the terrain surface. We test each policy for 10,000 time-steps with 1,000 robots.\nTABLE I:\nQuantitative comparison Results.\nSuccess Rate (SR)\n↑\n\\uparrow\nLanding Area %\n↑\n\\uparrow\nTerrain Type\nOurs\nNo Edge\nOurs\nNo Edge\nStair Ascent\n100.00%\n100.00%\n0.99\n0.98\nStair Descent\n99.95%\n99.82%\n0.94\n0.87\nDeep Gap\n100.0%\n99.94%\n0.96\n0.94\nSmall Box\n99.09%\n93.17%\n0.96\n0.95\nAs shown in\nTable I\n, our method outperforms\nNo Edge\nin both success rate and landing area. It should be noted that the mean landing area values are generally high because the robot spends a considerable portion of each episode on flat ground; thus, the observed gap indicates a substantial improvement specifically in edge-dense areas.\nFigure 9:\nThe robot slips and falls after stepping on a stair edge.\nIn the real world, stepping on edges sometimes causes slippage or unpredictable contact dynamics, driving the robot into Out-of-Distribution (OOD) states that lead to immediate falls, as shown in\nFigure 9\n. By incentivizing the policy to maximize the landing area and avoid edges, our method significantly reduces these real-world risks, ensuring greater robustness during physical deployment. As shown in\nFigure 6\n, our policy exhibits redundant safety margins and maintains stable footholds throughout the traverse.\nTo further demonstrate the scalability of our framework, we evaluate the edge detector on two new terrain types:\nStones\nand\nStakes\n. As illustrated in\nFigure 10\n, the detector precisely identifies terrain edges without any manual feature engineering or parameter tuning. This robust zero-shot performance confirms that our edge-aware mechanism can scale to arbitrary terrain topologies.\nFigure 10:\nGeneralization of edge detector to new terrains.\nTABLE II:\nComprehensive ablation results across all terrain types and configurations.\nSuccess Rate (%)\n↑\n\\uparrow\nMean Reaching Time (s)\n↓\n\\downarrow\nMethod\nLarge Box\nRamp\nSmall Box\nRough\nStair down\nPlatform down\nStair up\nPlatform up\nGap\nLarge Box\nRamp\nSmall Box\nRough\nStair down\nPlatform down\nStair up\nPlatform up\nGap\nOurs\n100.0\n100.0\n99.09\n100.0\n99.95\n100.0\n100.0\n100.0\n100.0\n5.50\n5.84\n8.03\n5.40\n4.45\n5.48\n5.35\n5.45\n5.43\nw/o depth history\n100.0\n100.0\n1.66\n100.0\n99.49\n99.70\n99.93\n100.0\n100.0\n5.90\n6.72\n11.68\n5.78\n5.54\n5.82\n6.98\n5.91\n5.79\nw/o pose-based\n100.0\n100.0\n90.68\n100.0\n100.0\n100.0\n99.74\n100.0\n100.0\n5.90\n5.74\n11.32\n5.72\n6.02\n5.82\n6.39\n6.34\n5.70\nw/o MoE\n100.0\n100.0\n84.51\n100.0\n99.68\n100.0\n100.0\n100.0\n100.0\n6.06\n6.22\n10.98\n5.49\n5.23\n5.65\n6.12\n5.51\n5.59\nw/o Amp\n99.56\n99.94\n0.00\n100.0\n99.94\n100.0\n100.0\n99.94\n99.94\n7.27\n5.68\n–\n6.50\n5.80\n6.31\n6.17\n6.25\n6.07\nIV-D\nAblation Study on Training Recipe\nTo investigate the individual contributions of our proposed components, we conduct a series of ablation studies by comparing our full framework against the following versions:\n•\nSingle-frame Depth (w/o depth history)\n: The policy receives only the current depth image instead of the strided temporal history.\n•\nUniform Command (w/o pose-based)\n: The policy is trained using standard uniform velocity sampling with heading commands.\n•\nVanilla MLP (w/o MoE)\n: The policy network is replaced by a standard Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with an equivalent number of parameters.\n•\nNo Motion Prior (w/o AMP)\n: The Adversarial Motion Prior is removed, training the policy solely through task-related rewards.\nWe test each policy for 10,000 time-steps with 1,000 robots in simulation. We evaluate the Success Rate and Mean Reaching Time across different terrain types.\nAs shown in\nTable II\n, our full method achieves the highest success rate, demonstrating that the integration of all proposed components is essential for traversing complex geometries.\nV\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we present a scalable end-to-end perceptive locomotion framework for humanoid robots. By integrating a novel volumetric edge-aware penalization mechanism with position-based velocity command generation, our approach achieves high-dynamic behaviors on complex terrains. We conduct extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world deployment. It demonstrates that our framework enables humanoid robots to perform agile running and stable walking across a variety of challenging environments.\nDespite these advancements, our current system has two primary limitations. First, the perception system relies solely on a single onboard forward-facing depth camera, which leads to a lack of backward or lateral movement capability. Future work may attach multiple cameras to the robot to enable omnidirectional perception and agility. Second, we observe that training a variety of terrains and gait modes simultaneously can lead to mode collapse and performance degradation compared to specialized policies. Advanced multi-task reinforcement learning techniques can be investigated to enhance the capacity of a single unified policy.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work is accomplished with the help of Xiangting Meng, Baijun Ye, Siqiao Huang, and Yizhuo Gao.\nReferences\n[1]\nA.

    "preview_text": "Achieving robust humanoid hiking in complex, unstructured environments requires transitioning from reactive proprioception to proactive perception. However, integrating exteroception remains a significant challenge: mapping-based methods suffer from state estimation drift; for instance, LiDAR-based methods do not handle torso jitter well. Existing end-to-end approaches often struggle with scalability and training complexity; specifically, some previous works using virtual obstacles are implemented case-by-case. In this work, we present \\textit{Hiking in the Wild}, a scalable, end-to-end parkour perceptive framework designed for robust humanoid hiking. To ensure safety and training stability, we introduce two key mechanisms: a foothold safety mechanism combining scalable \\textit{Terrain Edge Detection} with \\textit{Foot Volume Points} to prevent catastrophic slippage on edges, and a \\textit{Flat Patch Sampling} strategy that mitigates reward hacking by generating feasible navigation targets. Our approach utilizes a single-stage reinforcement learning scheme, mapping raw depth inputs and proprioception directly to joint actions, without relying on external state estimation. Extensive field experiments on a full-size humanoid demonstrate that our policy enables robust traversal of complex terrains at speeds up to 2.5 m/s. The training and deployment code is open-sourced to facilitate reproducible research and deployment on real robots with minimal hardware modifications.\n\nHiking in the Wild: A Scalable Perceptive Parkour Framework for Humanoids\nShaoting Zhu\n12\n1, Ziwen Zhuang\n12\n1, Mengjie Zhao\n1\n, Kun-Ying Lee\n3\n, Hang Zhao\n12\n2\n1\nIIIS, Tsinghua University,\n2\nShanghai Qi Zhi Institute,\n3\nDepartment of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University\n1Equal contribution 2Corresponding author\nAbstract\nAchieving robust humanoid hiking in complex, unstructured environments requires transitioning from reactive proprioception to proactive perception.

(2024) *Real-world humanoid locomotion with reinforcement learning*; Siekmann et al. (2021) *Blind bipedal stair traversal*; Gu et al. (2024) *Humanoid-gym*。\n*   **核心思想**：仅依赖**本体感知**（关节位置、速度、IMU等），通过强化学习训练出鲁棒的运动策略。\n*   **改进与价值**：证明了数据驱动方法在复杂地形（草地、碎石、楼梯）上的**反应式**鲁棒性。它建立了无需外部感知的稳定运动基线。\n*   **根本局限**：**被动反应**。机器人只能在发生碰撞或失稳后进行调整，无法预见前方的大障碍（如深沟、高台），存在**安全性天花板**。\n\n#### 阶段二：引入外感知，模块化与地图重建\n*   **发展方向A：基于LiDAR与高程图**\n    *   **代表工作**：He et al. (2025) *Attention-based map encoding*; Long et al. (2025) *Learning humanoid locomotion with perceptive internal model*。\n    *   **核心思想**：使用LiDAR扫描构建环境的2.5D高程图或体素网格，基于此进行运动规划。\n    *   **改进**：引入了**前瞻性**，能够规划绕过大型障碍物的路径。\n    *   **瓶颈**：\n        1.  **严重依赖精确的状态估计（定位）**，在野外易产生漂移。\n        2.  LiDAR频率低，存在运动畸变，难以支持**高速动态运动**。\n        3.  系统复杂，通常不开源，**可复现性和可扩展性差**。\n\n*   **发展方向B：基于深度图像与高度图重建**\n    *   **代表工作**：Duan et al. (2024) *Learning vision-based bipedal locomotion*; Sun et al. (2025) *DPL*。\n    *   **核心思想**：使用深度相机，通过中间网络模块从深度图像中**重建出地形高度图**，再基于高度图进行规划或控制。\n    *   **改进**：相比LiDAR，深度相机更轻便、高频，成本更低。\n    *   **瓶颈**：\n        1.  高度图重建模块可能引入误差，且在**未见过的野外复杂地形上泛化能力有限**。\n        2.  整个感知-规划-控制**流水线长**，延迟高，通常仍限于**低速**场景。\n        3.  方法高度定制化（如相机位姿），**难以迁移和复现**。\n\n#### 阶段三：端到端感知运动控制的兴起\n*   **代表工作**：Cheng et al. (2024) *Extreme parkour with legged robots* (用于四足); Zhuang et al. (2024) *Humanoid parkour learning*。\n*   **核心思想**：摒弃复杂的中间表示（如地图重建）和模块化流水线，使用**强化学习直接训练一个策略**，将**原始深度图像和本体感知映射到关节动作**。\n*   **重大改进**：\n    1.  **简化系统**：去除了对外部定位和地图重建的依赖，降低了系统复杂度和故障点。\n    2.  **高带宽控制**：能够处理高频原始感知数据，为实现**高速动态行为**（如跑酷）提供了可能。\n    3.  **隐式学习**：策略隐式地学习地形特征与动作的关联，而非显式规划。\n*   **遗留问题**：\n    1.  **训练稳定性与安全性**：如何确保端到端训练中，双足机器人能学会安全、精确的落脚点？\n    2.  **奖励黑客问题**：在复杂地形训练中，智能体容易学会“欺骗”奖励函数（如原地转圈），而非真正穿越障碍。\n    3.  **可扩展性**：早期工作（如Cheng et al.）使用虚拟障碍进行边缘惩罚，需要为每种地形手工设计，**无法扩展到任意的、未知的网格地形**。\n\n#### 阶段四（本文）：可扩展、安全、高效的端到端框架\n*   **工作**：Zhu et al. *Hiking in the Wild*。\n*   **核心思想**：在端到端范式基础上，系统性地解决了**安全性**、**训练效率**和**可扩展性**三大核心挑战。\n*   **关键改进与贡献**：\n\n| 发展方向 | 前作的瓶颈 | 本文的改进 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **1. 安全性与精确落脚点** | 模型化方法对地图误差脆弱；早期端到端方法（如边缘惩罚）需要为每种地形手工设计，不可扩展。 | 提出 **可扩展地形边缘检测 + 足部体积点惩罚** 机制。**自动**从任意三角网格地形中检测边缘，并通过体积点穿透惩罚，**隐式地**引导策略将脚放置在平坦区域中心，无需手工设计或显式轨迹规划。 |\n| **2. 训练效率与指令跟踪** | 随机速度指令易导致“奖励黑客”；纯目标点指令无法控制速度，且随机目标可能不可达。 | 提出 **基于平坦区域采样的位置速度指令生成**。在可到达的**平坦区域**上采样目标点，根据机器人相对目标的位置和预设速度限值生成速度指令。这确保了训练任务始终是物理上可解的，**消除了奖励黑客，加速了收敛**。 |\n| **3. 感知仿真与零样本迁移** | 仿真与真实的深度数据存在差异，影响Sim-to-Real迁移。 | 设计了**双向深度对齐管道** (`ℱ_sim`, `ℱ_real`)，在仿真中注入传感器噪声、运动模糊、异常值等，在真实中进行修复，**最小化仿真与现实差距**，实现了**零样本**迁移，无需外部定位系统。 |\n| **4. 策略容量与运动风格** | 单一策略难以同时掌握行走、奔跑等多种技能和应对多样地形。 | 采用**混合专家模型** 处理高维视觉数据和复杂技能；使用**对抗运动先验** 融合MPC的稳定性与人类动作的自然性，提升了运动质量和多样性。 |\n| **5. 系统性能与验证** | 多数方法限于低速或简单结构化环境。 | 实现了**高达2.5 m/s的奔跑速度**，并能穿越高台（32cm）、宽沟（50cm）等复杂野外地形，通过了**长时间的实地测试**，证明了其**高动态性**和**鲁棒性**。 |\n\n### 总结\n该方向的发展呈现出清晰的演进路径：从**盲运动**（反应式鲁棒）到**感知运动**（前瞻式规划），再从**复杂的模块化地图重建**走向**简洁的端到端控制**。本文站在端到端范式的前沿，通过一系列**可扩展的、自动化的机制**（边缘检测、平坦区域采样、深度对齐），系统性地攻克了该范式在落地应用中的核心难题——**安全、高效训练与零样本部署**，将人形机器人的野外运动能力推向了新的高度（高速、高动态、高复杂度地形）。其**开源代码**也极大地促进了该方向的可复现研究和实际部署。",

Conclusion）的讨论，当前提出的框架存在两个主要局限性：\n\n- **感知系统视野受限**：系统仅依赖**单个前向深度相机**。这导致机器人缺乏**向后或侧向移动**的能力，限制了其在需要全方位机动（如后退避障、横向跨越）场景中的应用。\n\n- **多任务训练中的性能权衡**：当尝试在**单一策略**中同时训练多种地形适应和步态模式（如行走与奔跑）时，观察到**模式崩溃**和**性能下降**的现象。与针对特定任务训练的专用策略相比，统一策略的能力可能有所妥协。\n\n## 未来可能的改进方向\n\n基于上述局限性，论文提出了相应的未来研究方向：\n\n- **扩展感知系统**：在机器人上**安装多个摄像头**（如前、后、侧向），构建**全向感知系统**。这将使机器人获得360度的环境感知能力，从而支持更复杂的敏捷运动，如侧移、倒车和原地旋转。\n\n- **探索先进的多任务学习技术**：研究更先进的**多任务强化学习技术**，以增强单一统一策略的容量和鲁棒性。目标是让一个策略能够高效地掌握多种技能（如不同速度的行走、奔跑、跨越），同时避免模式崩溃，保持甚至超越专用策略的性能。\n\n## 总结\n该论文的核心局限性在于**传感器的物理配置**和**多技能学习的算法挑战**。对应的改进方向非常明确：通过**硬件升级**实现全向感知，以及通过**算法创新**来突破当前多任务强化学习的瓶颈。这些改进将使仿人机器人具备更接近人类的、在复杂非结构化环境中全方位自主移动的能力。",
