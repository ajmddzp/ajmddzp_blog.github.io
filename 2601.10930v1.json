    "html_content": "Where to Touch, How to Contact: Hierarchical RL–MPC Framework for Geometry-Aware Long-Horizon Dexterous Manipulation\nZhixian Xie\nYu Xiang\nMichael Posa\nWanxin Jin\nAbstract\nA key challenge in contact-rich dexterous manipulation is the need to jointly reason over geometry, kinematic constraints, and intricate, nonsmooth contact dynamics. End-to-end visuomotor policies bypass this structure, but often require large amounts of data, transfer poorly from simulation to reality, and generalize weakly across tasks/embodiments. We address those limitations by leveraging a simple insight: dexterous manipulation is inherently hierarchical—at a high level, a robot decides where to touch (geometry) and move the object (kinematics); at a low level it determines how to realize that plan through contact dynamics. Building on this insight, we propose a hierarchical RL–MPC framework in which a high-level reinforcement learning (RL) policy predicts a contact intention, a novel object-centric interface that specifies (i) an object-surface contact location and (ii) a post-contact object-level subgoal pose. Conditioned on this contact intention, a low-level contact-implicit model predictive control (MPC) optimizes local contact modes and replans with contact dynamics to generate robot actions that robustly drive the object toward each subgoal. We evaluate the framework on non-prehensile tasks, including geometry-generalized pushing and object 3D reorientation. It achieves near-100% success with substantially reduced data (10\n×\n\\times\nless than end-to-end baselines), highly robust performance, and zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.\nI\nIntroduction\nDexterous manipulation is a hallmark skill of intelligent robots. Recent research has made significant progress by training robot policies either from demonstrations, e.g., imitation learning\n[\n65\n,\n8\n]\nand vision language action model\n[\n4\n,\n26\n,\n15\n]\n, or from robot experience, e.g., reinforcement learning\n[\n42\n,\n63\n]\n. These approaches typically learn a end-to-end policy from robot observations to low-level motor commands. While\nend-to-end methods can achieve impressive performance, such as emergent generalization\n[\n51\n]\nand robustness\n[\n30\n]\n, they often face practical challenges, such as data scarcity, sim-to-real gap, and lack of task or embodiment generalizability.\nYet, human manipulation does not necessarily use a monolithic end-to-end motor policy\n[\n37\n,\n17\n]\n. For instance, when picking up a hammer to strike a nail,we do not directly infer low-level finger–joint commands from raw perception. Instead, we reason hierarchically: at a higher level, we decide\nwhere\nto contact (e.g., grasping the handle) and\nwhat\nobject-level outcome to achieve (e.g., aligning the head with the nail); at lower level, we determine\nhow\nto realize this plan guided by our intuitive physics, leveraging interaction strategies such as rolling, sliding, sticking, and disengagement. This hierarchical decomposition enables humans to combine semantic and geometric understanding and physics intuition, yielding efficient and robust manipulation control.\nIn this work, we propose an analogous hierarchical reasoning framework for robotic contact-rich manipulation. The hierarchical framework includes\n•\nHigher level: geometric-kinematic reasoning.\nGiven a scene observation, the higher-level learning-based policy determines where on the object surface the robot should establish contact (geometry) and where the object should move as a result (kinematics). To formalize this decision, we introduce a novel representation, termed\nContact Intention\n, which specifies (i) contact locations on the object surface and (ii) a post-contact object subgoal for the desired object-level motion progress. We train this higher-level policy using reinforcement learning\n•\nLower level: contact dynamics reasoning.\nConditioned on the generated contact intention, the dynamic\ncontact planner generates joint-level commands by optimizing with contact dynamics. Leveraging recent advances\nin real-time contact-implicit model predictive control,\nthis level synthesizes local contact modes, including\nrolling, sticking, sliding, and purposeful disengagement, at\nthe suggested contact location, robustly moving\nthe object to the planned subgoal.\nThe two levels forms a hierarchical RL–MPC framework that offers the following benefits:\n(I) Significant data efficiency for geometry-aware long-horizon manipulation.\nBy delegating contact dynamics reasoning to MPC optimization, the framework avoids inefficient learning over non-smooth contact dynamics. This allows the learning policy to focus on geometry and kinematics, enabling more efficient learning of long-horizon contact behaviors.\n(II) Robust performance enabled by contact implicit MPC.\nThe low-level MPC replans at high frequency (\n∼\n\\sim\n100 Hz) with contact dynamics, continuously correcting for disturbances and modeling errors. This reduces sensitivity to simulation imperfections and improves robustness in sim-to-real deployment.\n(III) Contact intention interface facilitating sim-to-real transfer.\nThe contact-intention interface decouples the geometric-kinematic reasoning from low-level contact dynamics. This allows training a policy in simulator where geometry/kinematics transfer more reliably than contact dynamics. It makes the learned higher-level RL policy inherently more robust for sim-to-real deployment than an end-to-end policy that must account for hard-to-model contact dynamics.\nIn sum, we highlight our following contributions:\n(1) We introduce\ncontact intention\n, a hierarchical policy interface that decomposes dexterous manipulation into geometric–kinematic reasoning (where to touch) and contact dynamics reasoning (how to contact). It enables data-efficient, geometry-aware manipulation with robust sim-to-real transfer.\n(2) We develop a hierarchical RL–MPC framework built on the contact intention interface. The higher-level RL policy predicts the contact intention, which then parameterizes a lower-level MPC for contact dynamics reasoning. This framework demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in data efficiency, success rate, robustness for geometry-aware long-horizon non-prehensile manipulation.\n(3) We introduce multiple design novelties for higher-level RL policy training, including (i) a\ntri-component\nobject-centric representation space that jointly encodes object geometry, task progress, and collision feasibility, and (ii) a\ndual-branch\npolicy network architecture that captures both local geometry and global kinematic context. These designs enable a\nunified\npolicy to learn non-prehensile manipulation across diverse objects and to generalize to unseen geometries.\nII\nRelated Works\nII-A\nRL-MPC Hierarchy in Robot Manipulation\nThe use of RL–MPC architectures is extensive in robotic locomotion\n[\n61\n,\n64\n,\n6\n,\n23\n,\n19\n]\n, where the primary objective is to achieve agile, adaptive, and diverse motor behaviors by combining learned high-level decision making with model-based control. This paradigm has more recently been transferred to robotic manipulation, where adaptability and generalization are crucial. For instance, in\n[\n47\n,\n33\n]\n, reinforcement learning is employed to infer the latent dynamics of deformable objects, which are subsequently incorporated into MPC or adaptive control for accurate manipulation. Other works\n[\n40\n,\n34\n]\nleverage RL to assist with learning contact-rich dynamics models and to provide a policy warm-start for sampling-based MPC solvers. In another line of research\n[\n3\n,\n68\n]\n, RL predicts intermediate end-effector goals that are tracked by a low-level MPC controller, thereby ensuring feasibility and safety during contact-rich tasks. Unlike prior uses of RL as auxiliary guidance or trajectory prediction, we introduce a tightly coupled RL–MPC hierarchy enabled by a novel\ncontact intention\ninterface for contact-rich manipulation. This design allows RL to reason over object geometry and kinematics while MPC handles high-frequency dynamic contact strategies, together enabling robust and dexterous manipulation.\nII-B\nNon-Prehensile Manipulation\nSince the proposed method is primarily applied to non-prehensile manipulation, we review the relevant prior work below.\nNon-prehensile manipulation\n[\n36\n]\nis defined as manipulating objects without explicitly grasping them. Classic work in non-prehensile manipulation studied the mechanics and control of the manipulator-object motion primitives\n[\n35\n,\n1\n]\n. However, motion primitives\nface scalability issue in the open-ended world. Recent effort attacks the problem through contact-implicit planning\n[\n38\n,\n39\n,\n62\n,\n55\n,\n41\n,\n7\n,\n27\n,\n2\n,\n60\n,\n5\n]\n, which allows a robot to automatically discover contact modes through optimization with contact dynamics. Learning methods have also been used in non-prehensile manipulation, such as the work based on reinforcement learning\n[\n66\n,\n9\n,\n10\n,\n29\n,\n32\n]\n, imitation learning\n[\n8\n,\n45\n,\n67\n,\n44\n,\n53\n,\n54\n]\nor both\n[\n49\n]\n. From method structure perspective, our work is most relevant to the recent work of PushAnything\n[\n5\n]\n, HiDex\n[\n7\n]\n, HACMan\n[\n66\n]\nand HDP\n[\n54\n]\n. PushAnything samples contact locations and evaluates them via MPC; HiDex uses MCTS for contact selection followed by path planning; HACMan jointly learns contact selection and motion in a single RL policy; and HDP employs a diffusion-based hierarchy for contact prediction and trajectory generation. In contrast, our method introduces a tightly coupled RL–MPC hierarchy in which the learned decision goes beyond contact point selection to include an object-level subgoal, and the predicted contact intention directly parameterizes the low-level MPC controller.\nII-C\nRobot Manipulation Based on Affordance\nOur work is also related to affordance-based manipulation, where affordance describes which object-surface regions are suitable for interaction with the robot. Substantial research has focused on predicting and leveraging affordance maps for grasping tasks\n[\n18\n,\n16\n,\n57\n,\n11\n,\n12\n,\n24\n,\n28\n]\n. Recently, foundation models with strong semantic reasoning have further been used to infer affordance for robotic tasks\n[\n21\n,\n22\n,\n50\n,\n31\n,\n48\n,\n52\n]\n.\nAffordance prediction alone only indicates\nwhere\nto make contact and lacks guidance on\nhow\nto act after contact, while remaining static during manipulation. Our method addresses this by dynamically predicting contact intentions online and coupling them with a physics-based planner to generate adaptive, physically grounded non-prehensile motions.\nFigure 2\n:\nIllustration of the RL-MPC hierarchical framework\nIII\nContact Intention and Hierarchical RL-MPC Framework\nIII-A\nContact Intention for Contact-Rich Manipulation\nConsider\nn\nn\nactive\ncontact points (general end effectors) on a robot that can be intentionally actuated to interact with an object. For example,\nn\n=\n1\nn=1\nfor a robot arm with a stick-like end-effector, and\nn\n=\n4\nn=4\nfor the fingertips of a four-fingered robotic hand. We distinguish these active contact points from passive ones that many arise without deliberate interaction, e.g., object–environment (or other robot links) contacts.\nThe goal of manipulation is for the robot to purposefully engage its\nn\nn\nactive contact points to interact with an object through contact and drive the object to a target pose\n𝒒\n¯\ntarget\n\\boldsymbol{\\bar{q}}^{\\text{target}}\n. For this,\nwe define\nContact Intention\nas a higher-level action:\n𝐈\n=\n(\n𝒄\n¯\n1\n,\n𝒄\n¯\n2\n,\n…\n,\n𝒄\n¯\nn\n,\n𝒒\n¯\nobj\n)\n∈\n𝒢\nn\n×\nSE\n​\n(\n3\n)\n,\n\\mathbf{I}=(\\boldsymbol{\\bar{c}}^{1},\\boldsymbol{\\bar{c}}^{2},\\ldots,\\boldsymbol{\\bar{c}}^{n},\\,\\boldsymbol{\\bar{q}}^{\\text{obj}})\\in\\mathcal{G}^{n}\\times\\mathrm{SE}(3),\n(1)\nHere,\n(\n𝒄\n¯\n1\n,\n𝒄\n¯\n2\n,\n…\n,\n𝒄\n¯\nn\n)\n(\\boldsymbol{\\bar{c}}^{1},\\boldsymbol{\\bar{c}}^{2},\\ldots,\\boldsymbol{\\bar{c}}^{n})\nare the corresponding contact locations on the object surface. Each location\n𝒄\n¯\ni\n∈\n𝒢\n\\boldsymbol{\\bar{c}}^{i}\\in\\mathcal{G}\n,\ni\n=\n1\n,\n.\n.\n,\nn\ni=1,..,n\n, specifies an\ninteraction anchor\non the object surface\n𝒢\n\\mathcal{G}\nfor an active contact point\ni\ni\nto engage with.\n𝒒\n¯\nobj\n∈\nSE\n​\n(\n3\n)\n\\boldsymbol{\\bar{q}}^{\\text{obj}}\\in\\mathrm{SE}(3)\nis the post-contact subgoal pose of the object. It specifies the desired object-level outcome for the robot-object interaction at the suggested contact locations.

In this paper, we only consider non-prehensile manipulation using a stick-like end-effector attached to a robot arm. Thus,\nn\n=\n1\nn=1\n.\nIII-B\nOverview of RL-MPC Hierarchical Framework\nOur proposed RL-MPC hierarchical framework is shown in Fig.\n2\n. It consists of a higher-level policy for object-centric geometry and kinematics reasoning and a lower-level policy for contact dynamics reasoning.\nThe higher-level policy, trained using RL, predicts contact intention, which parameterizes the lower-level policy. The lower-level policy online optimize the robot action through local contact-implicit MPC.\nHigher-level RL policy for object-centric geometric-kinematic reasoning\nWe formulate contact-intention prediction as a POMDP, where the action space\n𝒜\n\\mathcal{A}\nis the proposed contact intention space\n𝒜\n=\n𝒢\nn\n×\nSE\n​\n(\n3\n)\n\\mathcal{A}=\\mathcal{G}^{n}\\times\\mathrm{SE}(3)\n. A higher-level policy\nπ\n\\pi\nmaps observations to contact intentions, which are executed by the lower-level MPC. At each decision step\nk\nk\n, the policy gets an observation\n𝒐\nk\n\\boldsymbol{o}_{k}\nand predicts contact intention\n𝐈\nk\n=\nπ\n​\n(\n𝒐\nk\n)\n∈\n𝒜\n\\mathbf{I}_{k}=\\pi(\\boldsymbol{o}_{k})\\in\\mathcal{A}\n. The predicted\n𝐈\nk\n\\mathbf{I}_{k}\nwill parameterize the lower-level MPC for local contact dynamics reasoning. We train\nπ\n\\pi\nin simulation, which will be detailed in Section\nVI\n.\nLower-level contact-implicit MPC for contact dynamics reasoning\nFor contact dynamics reasoning, we use the complementarity-free model predictive control (ComFree-MPC) for its robustness and high speed\n[\n25\n]\n. Given a contact intention\n𝐈\nk\n=\n(\n𝒄\n¯\nk\n1\n,\n𝒄\n¯\nk\n2\n,\n…\n,\n𝒄\n¯\nk\nn\n,\n𝒒\n¯\nk\nobj\n)\n\\mathbf{I}_{k}=(\\boldsymbol{\\bar{c}}^{1}_{k},\\boldsymbol{\\bar{c}}^{2}_{k},...,\\boldsymbol{\\bar{c}}^{n}_{k},\\boldsymbol{\\bar{q}}^{\\text{obj}}_{k})\nfrom the higher level, ComFree-MPC reasons about the rich local contact strategies at the suggested contact location\n(\n𝒄\n¯\nk\n1\n,\n𝒄\n¯\nk\n2\n,\n…\n,\n𝒄\n¯\nk\nn\n)\n(\\boldsymbol{\\bar{c}}^{1}_{k},\\boldsymbol{\\bar{c}}^{2}_{k},...,\\boldsymbol{\\bar{c}}^{n}_{k})\nto move the object towards the subgoal\n𝒒\n¯\nk\nobj\n\\boldsymbol{\\bar{q}}^{\\text{obj}}_{k}\n.

More details will be given in Section\nV\n.\nMulti-Rate RL-MPC Coupling\nThe ComFree-MPC executes for\nT\nT\nenvironment steps while the contact intention from the higher-level policy remains fixed. Below, we use\nk\nk\nto denote the higher-level decision step for updating contact intentions and\nt\nt\nto denote the lower-level MPC control step.\nIV\nRL for Geometric-Kinematic Reasoning\nWe use RL to train the higher-level policy for geometric-kinematic reasoning. At each decision step, the policy receives an observation and outputs a contact intention. To enable effective policy learning, we design the observation and action spaces, reward, and policy architecture in this section.\nIV-A\nRL Observation Space Design\nFigure 3\n:\nIllustration of the geometric, target and collision components in RL observation space. The green mesh stands for current object pose, and the red mesh stands for the manipulation target.\nAs in Fig.\n3\n, we design the higher-level observation space as a\ntri-component, object-centric\nrepresentation that jointly encodes object geometry, task progress, and collision. This design enables the RL policy to reason about\nobject shape\n,\ntask progress\n, and\ncontact feasibility\nin a unified manner.\nGeometry component\nWe downsample a set of\nN\nN\nkeypoints\n𝒫\n=\n{\n𝒑\ni\n}\ni\n=\n0\nN\n−\n1\n\\mathcal{P}=\\{\\boldsymbol{p}_{i}\\}_{i=0}^{N-1}\nfrom object point cloud, defined in the\nobject frame\n. These keypoints serve dual purposes: (i) as an approximation for the object geometry\n𝒢\n\\mathcal{G}\n, and (ii) as discrete candidates for selecting contact location in contact intention, i.e.,\n(\n𝒄\n¯\nk\n1\n,\n𝒄\n¯\nk\n2\n,\n…\n,\n𝒄\n¯\nk\nn\n)\n⊆\n𝒫\n(\\boldsymbol{\\bar{c}}^{1}_{k},\\boldsymbol{\\bar{c}}^{2}_{k},...,\\boldsymbol{\\bar{c}}^{n}_{k})\\subseteq\\mathcal{P}\n.\nTarget component\nTo encode the target-aware observation, we define the\nkeypoint goal flow\nin the object frame,\nΔ\n​\n𝒫\nk\n=\n{\n𝜹\ni\n,\nk\n|\n𝜹\ni\n,\nk\n=\n𝒑\ni\n,\nk\ntarget\n−\n𝒑\ni\n}\ni\n=\n0\nN\n−\n1\n\\Delta\\mathcal{P}_{k}=\\{\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_{i,k}|\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_{i,k}=\\boldsymbol{p}_{i,k}^{\\text{target}}-\\boldsymbol{p}_{i}\\}_{i=0}^{N-1}\n,\nwhere\n𝒑\ni\n,\nk\ntarget\n\\boldsymbol{p}_{i,k}^{\\text{target}}\ndenotes the position of the same keypoint\n𝒑\ni\n\\boldsymbol{p}_{i}\nwhen the object is at the target, expressed in the current object frame at decision step\nk\nk\n. The keypoint goal flow\nΔ\n​\n𝒫\nk\n\\Delta\\mathcal{P}_{k}\nrepresents the object-frame displacement of all keypoints from the current object pose to the target. Encoding keypoint goals in the object frame is crucial for stable and geometry-consistent policy learning. Otherwise, the discrepency between body and world frames would force the policy to implicitly learn object translations and rotations, significantly increasing the learning burden.\nCollision component\nTo inform contact feasibility, we include\nper-keypoint clearance distances\nas part of the observation.\nFor each keypoint\n𝒑\ni\n\\boldsymbol{p}_{i}\nat decision step\nk\nk\n, we compute its minimum Euclidean distance\nd\ni\n,\nk\nd_{i,k}\nto the environment (e.g., ground and walls). We collect these distances as\n𝒟\nk\n=\n{\nd\ni\n,\nk\n}\ni\n=\n0\nN\n−\n1\n\\mathcal{D}_{k}=\\{d_{i,k}\\}_{i=0}^{N-1}\n.\n𝒟\nk\n\\mathcal{D}_{k}\nencode the\ncontact feasibility\nof each keypoint: keypoints with small clearance (\nd\ni\n,\nk\n≈\n0\nd_{i,k}\\approx 0\n) indicate it is in contact with their surrounding environment, thus are treated as invalid candidates to be a contact location. Including\n𝒟\nk\n\\mathcal{D}_{k}\nenables RL policy to avoid selecting contact locations that are physically blocked by the environment. For example, for a cube resting on a table, keypoints on the bottom face are infeasible contact locations for the end-effectors.\nIn sum, the tri-component, object-centric observation at the higher-level decision step\nk\nk\nis the tuple\n𝒐\nk\n=\n(\n𝒫\n,\nΔ\n​\n𝒫\nk\n,\n𝒟\nk\n)\n.\n\\boldsymbol{o}_{k}=\\big(\\mathcal{P},\\,\\Delta\\mathcal{P}_{k},\\,\\mathcal{D}_{k}\\big).\n(3)\nWe provide the ablation and comparison study for our above design in Section\nVII\n.\nFigure 4\n:\nThe dual-branch architecture design for the higher-level RL policy that predicts contact intention.\nIV-B\nRL Action Space Design\nThe higher-level RL policy receives the observation\n𝒐\n\\boldsymbol{o}\nand selects a contact intention\n𝐈\n=\n(\n𝒄\n¯\n1\n,\n𝒄\n¯\n2\n,\n…\n,\n𝒄\n¯\nn\n,\n𝒒\n¯\nobj\n)\n\\mathbf{I}=(\\boldsymbol{\\bar{c}}^{1},\\boldsymbol{\\bar{c}}^{2},...,\\boldsymbol{\\bar{c}}^{n},\\boldsymbol{\\bar{q}}^{\\text{obj}})\n.

At decision step\nk\nk\n, the policy network takes as input per-keypoint observations\n𝒐\nk\n=\n{\n𝒑\ni\n,\n𝜹\ni\n,\nk\n,\nd\ni\n,\nk\n}\ni\n=\n0\nN\n−\n1\n\\boldsymbol{o}_{k}=\\{\\boldsymbol{p}_{i},\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_{i,k},d_{i,k}\\}_{i=0}^{N-1}\n,\nwhich encode each keypoint’s body-frame location, goal displacement, and contact feasibility.\nThe input first goes through\ngeometric branch\n: it processes per-keypoint features using a segmentation-style PointNet++ encoder to produce latent features\n𝒛\ni\n\\boldsymbol{z}_{i}\n, which are mapped to logits for contact location selection. Meantime, the input also goes through\nglobal kinematic branch\n, which aggregates all keypoint inputs into a single object-centric embedding\n𝒈\n\\boldsymbol{g}\nvia a classification-style PointNet++ encoder. Linear heads then predict categorical logits over MPC cost weights\n(\n𝒲\npos\n,\n𝒲\nori\n)\n(\\mathcal{W}_{\\text{pos}},\\mathcal{W}_{\\text{ori}})\nand a scalar value estimate for critic learning. This architecture efficiently combines local geometric reasoning with global object-level context, enabling the policy to select feasible contact locations and implicitly specify object subgoals.\nV\nMPC for Local Dynamic Contact Planning\nWe use ComFree-MPC for lower-level contact dynamics reasoning, conditioned on RL-predicted contact intentions. By leveraging an efficient closed-form contact physics model, ComFree-MPC performs high-speed receding-horizon optimization, enabling the system to reason over contact strategies (rolling, sliding, sticking, and making/breaking) and drive the object toward the subgoal. We detail the formulation below.\nV-A\nComplementarity-Free Contact Dynamics\nWe adopt the quasi-dynamic complementarity-free contact model from\n[\n25\n]\nfor our relatively slow non-prehensile manipulation task, given by\nM\n​\n𝒗\n+\n=\nh\n​\n𝝉\n​\n(\n𝒖\n)\n+\nh\n​\nJ\n~\n⊤\n​\n𝝀\n,\n\\displaystyle M\\boldsymbol{v}^{+}=h\\boldsymbol{\\tau}(\\boldsymbol{u})\\;+\\;h\\tilde{J}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\lambda},\n(7)\n𝝀\n:=\nmax\n​\n(\n−\nK\n​\n(\nh\n2\n​\nJ\n~\n​\nM\n−\n1\n​\n𝝉\n​\n(\n𝒖\n)\n+\nϕ\n~\n)\n,\n0\n)\n,\n\\displaystyle\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}=\\mathrm{max}\\Big(-K\\bigl(h^{2}\\tilde{J}M^{-1}\\boldsymbol{\\tau}(\\boldsymbol{u})+\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}}\\bigr),0\\Big),\nwhere\nh\nh\nis the time step and\n𝒗\n+\n\\boldsymbol{v}^{+}\nis the next-step system velocity.\nM\n=\ndiag\n​\n(\nM\no\n,\nM\nr\n)\nM=\\text{diag}(M_{o},M_{r})\nis the mass matrix, with object inertia\nM\no\nM_{o}\nand robot stiffness\nM\nr\n=\nh\n2\n​\ndiag\n​\n(\nK\nr\n,\n…\n,\nK\nr\n)\nM_{r}=h^{2}\\text{diag}(K_{r},\\dots,K_{r})\nfor\nn\nn\nactive contact points.

Both tasks are performed with a 7-DOF Franka robot arm with a stick end-effector (Fig.\n5\n).\nFigure 5\n:\nTwo non-prehensile manipulation tasks. Left: Geometry-generalized pushing. Right: object 3D reorientation.\nVI-A\nTask Setup\nGeometry-generalized pushing\nThe goal is to learn a\nunified policy\nthat pushes diverse letter-shaped objects from arbitrary initial poses to planar targets. We use 12 English letters (Fig.\nLABEL:fig:intro\n): (E, H, L, N, T, X) for training and (F, I, K, V, Y, Z) held out for generalization test. The task requires long-horizon contact reasoning: sequentially switching contact facets and selecting appropriate contact strategies. Letters vary geometrically, from elongated (I) to branched shapes (K, Y), providing a challenging benchmark for geometry-aware contact-rich manipulation. For each letter, 256 keypoints are uniformly sampled on vertical side surfaces (Fig.\nLABEL:fig:intro\n).\nObject 3D reorientation\nThe goal is to reorient a cube from a random initial pose to a random 3D target. We uniformly sample 256 keypoints on its six faces. This task evaluates the method’s ability to generate richer contact strategies for precise 3D reorientation beyond planar pushing.\nThe detailed task settings for both the simulation and real world system can be found in Appendix\nIX-A\n.\nVI-B\nTraining Higher-Level Robot-Abstract Policy in Simulation\nFigure 6\n:\nIn the higher-level RL policy training, an abstract end-effector (red dot) replaces full robot arm. The target is half-transparent.\nThe higher-level contact-intention policy predicts object-centric contact locations and kinematic subgoals, so we train it in a simulation environment where the robot end-effector is abstracted a mass–spring–damper point (Fig.\n6\n). This reduces lower-level MPC complexity, speeding up learning. Despite the notable model gaps, we will later show that our decoupled hierarchical framework enables the trained policy to direct transfer to full robot embodiments in simulation (Section\nVII\n) and real experiments (Section\nVIII\n) with lower-level MPC.\nWe train the higher-level policy using PPO\n[\n46\n]\n. At each episode, object and target poses are randomized (Appendix\nIX-A\n), with one training object sampled per episode for the geometry-generalized pushing task. Episodes end on success or after 64 steps. Details on rewards, hyperparameters, and implementation are in Appendix\nIX-B\n.\nVI-C\nZero-Shot Transfer to Full Robotic Systems\nDeploying the trained higher-level contact-intention policy on a full robot requires adding the robot-specific ComFree-MPC. For one decision step of the RL policy, the lower-level ComFree-MPC moves the robot end effector near the desired contact location and executes dynamic contact replanning and control for multiple control steps. Since the MPC objective is parameterized by the policy, no additional training is needed. Three MPC parameter sets, tuned for simulation, real-world pushing, and real-world 3D reorientation, account for different dynamics; details are in Appendix\nIX-C\n.\nVII\nSimulation Results\nVII-A\nLearning Curves\nVII-A\n1\nTraining in robot-abstract setting\nWe perform five independent training runs per task, evaluating success rates at saved checkpoints with 64 trials each. In geometry-generalized pushing, we report separate curves for seen and unseen letters, randomly sampling objects and start/target poses per trial. For object 3D reorientation, trials are generated similarly. A trial succeeds if the object reaches sufficiently close to the target within 64 RL steps. Pose distributions and success criteria are in Appendix\nIX-A\n, and learning curves with the abstract end-effector are shown in Fig.\n7\n.\n(a)\nGeometry-generalized pushing\n(b)\nObject 3D reorientation\nFigure 7\n:\nLearning curves for both tasks.\nThe results show that the proposed method achieves high success rates with relativily small amount of training data:\n100\n%\n±\n0\n%\n100\\%\\pm 0\\%\nfor seen and\n99.06\n%\n±\n1.25\n%\n99.06\\%\\pm 1.25\\%\nfor unseen letters in pushing, and\n98.75\n%\n±\n1.17\n%\n98.75\\%\\pm 1.17\\%\nfor 3D reorientation, after\n∼\n\\sim\n40k and\n∼\n\\sim\n100k RL steps, respectively. The near-overlap of pushing learning curves for seen and unseen objects also indicates strong generalization to novel geometries in the pushing task.\nVII-A\n2\nEvaluation in Full Robotic System\nWe further evaluate the trained policies in a full Franka-arm simulation environment. For each trained checkpoint, we run 5 evaluation trials per letter in the geometry-generalized pushing task and 20 evaluation trials in the object 3D reorientation task.\nThe learned policies achieve consistently high success rates (near\n100\n%\n100\\%\n) while requiring only a small number of high-level RL decision steps to complete each task (approximately 10 on average). Table\nI\nsummarizes the success rates of our method in both the abstract and full-system settings, along with the number of RL decision steps required for task completion in full-system setting. We denote the pushing and 3D reorientation tasks by “P” and “R”, respectively.\nTABLE I\n:\nResult in Simulated Abstract and Full robot Setting\nTask\nSuccess (Abstract)\nSuccess (Full)\nSteps (Full)\nP (seen)\n100\n%\n±\n0\n%\n100\\%\\pm 0\\%\n100\n%\n±\n0\n%\n100\\%\\pm 0\\%\n9.0\n±\n5.4\n9.0\\pm 5.4\nP (unseen)\n99.06\n%\n±\n1.25\n%\n99.06\\%\\pm 1.25\\%\n97.34\n%\n±\n2.5\n%\n97.34\\%\\pm 2.5\\%\n11.2\n±\n8.0\n11.2\\pm 8.0\nR\n98.75\n%\n±\n1.17\n%\n98.75\\%\\pm 1.17\\%\n100\n%\n±\n0\n%\n100\\%\\pm 0\\%\n14.0\n±\n9.5\n14.0\\pm 9.5\nVII-B\nBaseline Comparison\nWe compare our hierarchical RL-MPC method with two baselines: (i) a end-to-end RL policy and (ii) a HACMan-style hierarchical policy without a physics-based MPC layer. In each comparison, five independent training runs are performed, and performance is evaluated using 64 trials per run.\nComparison with End-to-end RL learning\nThe end-to-end policy directly predicts end-effector actions, using an observation that includes object keypoints, goal flow, per-point clearance, and end-effector flow (distance vectors between the end-effector and all keypoints), all in world frame. End effector flow provides spatial context about the robot–object geometry. The policy reuses the global kinematic branch (Section\nIV-D\n) with separate linear heads for action and value prediction.\nWe found that directly using the reward in Section\nIV-C\nleads to the struggling of the end-to-end policy to effectively explore the effect contact with the object. To facilitate object interaction, we add an additional reward term\n0.5\n​\nexp\n⁡\n(\n−\n‖\n𝒅\nobj,ee\n‖\n2\n/\n0.02\n)\n,\n0.5\\exp\\!\\left(-{\\|\\boldsymbol{d}_{\\text{obj,ee}}\\|^{2}}/{0.02}\\right),\nto encourage the end effector to approach the object, where\n𝒅\nobj,ee\n\\boldsymbol{d}_{\\text{obj,ee}}\ndenotes the distance between the end effector and the object center. Episodes are also terminated early when\n‖\n𝒅\nobj,ee\n‖\n≥\n0.25\n\\|\\boldsymbol{d}_{\\text{obj,ee}}\\|\\geq 0.25\n, with a penalty of\n−\n5\n-5\n, to discourage drifting away from the object.\nWe evaluate the end-to-end and our hierarchical policies on (1) sample efficiency and (2) robustness to environment variations (i.e., sim-to-sim transfer), including external forces, friction, and actuator variations (Appendix\nIX-D\n). Ours use the same lower-level ComFree-MPC in geometry-generalized pushing task without additional tuning.\nFig.\n8\nshows checkpoint success versus high-level RL steps and total end-effector commands. The end-to-end policy converges slowly, reaching\n92.5\n%\n±\n7.55\n%\n92.5\\%\\pm 7.55\\%\nafter\n∼\n\\sim\n600K RL steps (corresponding to 600K control steps), while our proposed method achieves\n100\n%\n±\n0\n%\n100\\%\\pm 0\\%\nin 15K steps (approximately 300K control steps), giving\n∼\n\\sim\n40\n×\n\\times\nimprovement in terms of RL decision steps and\n∼\n\\sim\n2\n×\n\\times\nwith respect to control steps.\nFigure 8\n:\nThe result of baseline comparison with the end-to-end RL. Left: the training curve with respect to RL decision steps. Right: the training curve with respect to lower-level control steps.\nThe evaluation results of robustness to environment variation is shown in Table\nII\n. While the end-to-end policy performs well under external force and friction variations, its success drops from\n92.5\n%\n92.5\\%\nto\n44.0\n%\n44.0\\%\nunder robot actuator variations (including actuator’s stiffness and damping) due to overfitting to nominal dynamics in training. In contrast, the hierarchical policy maintains\n100\n%\n±\n0\n%\n100\\%\\pm 0\\%\nsuccess rate. We attribute this robustness to two factors: the higher-level contact-intention policy abstracts away low-level dynamics variations, and the lower-level MPC performs high-frequency replanning with an explicit physics model, continuously correcting execution errors induced by model errors. Overall, these results indicate that the proposed hierarchy simplifies learning and substantially improves robustness in environment variations.\nTABLE II\n:\nEvaluation results for robustness to environment variations\nVaritions\nSuccess Rate (End-to-End)\nSuccess Rate (Ours)\nNo Perturbation\n92.5\n%\n±\n7.55\n%\n92.5\\%\\pm 7.55\\%\n100\n%\n±\n0\n%\n100\\%\\pm 0\\%\nExternal Force\n89.6\n%\n±\n8.6\n%\n89.6\\%\\pm 8.6\\%\n100\n%\n±\n0\n%\n100\\%\\pm 0\\%\nFriction\n92.8\n%\n±\n6.8\n%\n92.8\\%\\pm 6.8\\%\n100\n%\n±\n0\n%\n100\\%\\pm 0\\%\nActuation\n44.0\n%\n±\n24.2\n%\n44.0\\%\\pm 24.2\\%\n100\n%\n±\n0\n%\n100\\%\\pm 0\\%\nComparison with HACMan-Style Hierarchy\nWe compare our RL-MPC framework with a HACMan-style hierarchical RL policy\n[\n66\n]\n, which directly predicts contact locations and corresponding end-effector 3D displacements. The RL observation space is unchanged, while the action space is\n𝒫\n×\n[\n−\n0.1\n,\n0.1\n]\n3\n\\mathcal{P}\\times[-0.1,0.1]^{3}\n, where\n𝒫\n\\mathcal{P}\ndenotes the set of candidate contact keypoints and\n[\n−\n0.1\n,\n0.1\n]\n3\n[-0.1,0.1]^{3}\nrepresents the end-effector 3D-displacement. Both our policy network are reused, but the MPC weight head is replaced with a displacement head. This comparison quantifies how the MPC lower-level aids structured exploration and improves manipulation success.\nFigure 9\n:\nResult of comparison with HACMan-style hierarchical policy.\nThe training result for solving the 3D object reorientation task is shown in Fig.\n9\n.\nHACMan-style hierarchical policy requires roughly 300K RL steps to reach about\n77.19\n%\n±\n29.80\n%\n77.19\\%\\pm 29.80\\%\nsuccess rate, while our method converges to\n98.75\n%\n±\n1.17\n%\n98.75\\%\\pm 1.17\\%\nsuccess rate within 200K steps. Furthermore, the variance in performance increases considerably without the MPC layer. These results highlight that the MPC plays a critical role in ensuring consistency and stability during task execution.\nVII-C\nAblation Studies\nVII-C\n1\nAblation 1: Removing Subgoal Prediction\n(a)\nAblation 1 & 2.\n(b)\nAblation 3.\nFigure 10\n:\nResults of ablation studies.\nTo evaluate the role of\nsubgoal prediction\n, we consider a variant where the higher-level policy predicts only contact locations, with fixed MPC terminal-cost weights (e.g.\nw\npos\n=\n100\nw_{\\text{pos}}{=}100\n,\nw\nori\n=\n4\nw_{\\text{ori}}{=}4\n) and all other settings unchanged. As shown by the green curve in Fig.\n10\n(a), removing subgoal prediction drops the success rate from\n100\n%\n±\n0.0\n%\n100\\%\\pm 0.0\\%\nto\n26.56\n%\n±\n20.44\n%\n26.56\\%\\pm 20.44\\%\n. We find that in the contact-only case, the MPC must simultaneously minimize both positional and rotational errors, leading to inefficient pushing that often exceeds the 64-step episode limit.. The ablation result highlights the critical role of subgoal selection for efficient manipulation.\nVII-C\n2\nAblation 2: Frame Mismatch in Observation\nThis ablation is designed to highlight the importance of expressing the geometry component\n𝒫\n\\mathcal{P}\nand the target component\nΔ\n​\n𝒫\n\\Delta\\mathcal{P}\nin a consistent reference frame. We train a policy under the same settings as the main experiment in the geometry-generalized pushing task, with the only difference being that\nΔ\n​\n𝒫\n\\Delta\\mathcal{P}\nis expressed in the world while\n𝒫\n\\mathcal{P}\nremains in the object frame. As shown with the blue curve in Fig.\n10\n(a), learning fails to bootstrap under this mismatch. This result demonstrates that a consistent object-centric representation is crucial for stable learning and for enabling the policy to reason effectively about geometry and goal relationships.\nVII-C\n3\nAblation 3: Removing Collision Component in Observation\nTo evaluate the role of the\ncollision component\n𝒟\nk\n\\mathcal{D}_{k}\n, we remove it from the observation for\nobject 3D reorientation\ntask, keeping all other settings unchanged. As shown in Fig.\n10\n(b), both learning speed and success rate drop (the success rate drops from\n98.75\n%\n±\n1.17\n%\n98.75\\%\\pm 1.17\\%\nto\n85.94\n%\n±\n8.15\n%\n85.94\\%\\pm 8.15\\%\n). A possible explanation is that without collision information, the value network overfits the feasibility penalty\nr\nfeasible\nr_{\\text{feasible}}\n, implicitly associating it with particular object configurations or poses, rather than with true contact feasibility. Thus it introduces noise and degrades policy performance. This result highlights the importance of\n𝒟\nk\n\\mathcal{D}_{k}\nfor effective manipulation.\nVIII\nReal-World Experiment\nVIII-A\nExperiment Setup\nFigure 11\n:\nThe Diagram of real-world system.\nWe deploy the higher-level policy trained in simulation in Section\nVII\non real-world system. Fig.\n11\nshows the hardware setup. The system composed of four modules. (1) The higher-level RL policy module. We use the stochastic version of the trained RL policy for contact-point selection in 3D reorientation task. This helps prevent the system from getting stuck due to noisy pose estimation. (2) Lower-level ComFree-MPC module (\n∼\n\\sim\n100Hz). (3) Robot operational space control (OSC) stack (\n∼\n\\sim\n500Hz)\n[\n13\n]\n. It receives the end-effector displacement command from ComFree-MPC. (4) The vision perception module (\n∼\n\\sim\n40Hz), which uses the TwinTrack\n[\n59\n]\nand FoundationPose++\n[\n56\n,\n58\n]\n.\nThese components interact through LCM communication middleware\n[\n20\n]\n. All objects are 3D-printed from the exact STL meshes used during training.\nVIII-B\nResults\nWe evaluate the proposed method on real-world geometry-generalized pushing and object 3D reorientation. For each letter in pushing task, we perform 10 independent trials. For the reorientation, we perform 25 independent trials. For each trial, the object is randomly placed on the table, and the target position is randomly generated. We analyze the result both qualitatively and quantitatively.\nQuantitative evaluation\nTable\nIII\nshows the hardware results for each letter in the pushing task and cube 3D reorientation task. It reports using three metrics: success rate over a fixed number of trials, the wall-clock time for completing the task (exec_time), and the number of RL decision steps needed to complete the task (num_steps).\nTABLE III\n:\nResult in real-world non-prehensile manipulation\nobject\nsuccess_rate\nexec_time (s)\nnum_steps\nE\n100.0%\n58.89 ± 28.70\n5.60 ± 2.72\nF\n100.0%\n89.64 ± 67.31\n8.70 ± 6.53\nH\n100.0%\n54.54 ± 21.12\n5.20 ± 2.04\nI\n70.0%\n72.69 ± 31.53\n7.14 ± 2.91\nK\n100.0%\n64.01 ± 31.27\n6.20 ± 3.08\nL\n100.0%\n100.39 ± 42.01\n9.60 ± 3.89\nN\n100.0%\n66.56 ± 42.20\n6.20 ± 3.85\nT\n100.0%\n48.13 ± 27.50\n4.70 ± 2.71\nV\n100.0%\n66.41 ± 44.49\n6.40 ± 4.33\nX\n100.0%\n54.62 ± 31.23\n5.30 ± 3.06\nY\n100.0%\n93.64 ± 41.15\n9.00 ± 3.92\nZ\n100.0%\n68.25 ± 66.42\n6.60 ± 6.24\nCube\n100.0%\n237.74 ± 147.55\n24.96 ± 15.5\nIn the pushing tasks, most objects, including unseen ones, achieve 100% success with few steps, showing reliable sim-to-real transfer; only letter I occasionally fails due to tracking failure. In the 3D reorientation task, our method maintains strong success, though requiring more steps.\nQualitative: diverse contact interaction strategies\nIn the object 3D reorientation task, multiple contact interaction strategies emerge, shown in Fig.\n12\n. In the first row, the robot’s end effector reorientates the cube purely by frictional sliding on the top face. In the second row, the end effector pivots the cube at an edge to rotate the object. In the third row, the robot reorientates the cube by pivoting it at one corner. The diverse interaction demonstrate the policy’s ability to adapt its contact strategy in different task situations, rather than relying on a single manipulation pattern. Overall, the results demonstrate that the hierarchical RL-MPC policy enables efficient, reliable, and generalizable real-world manipulation.\n(a)\nReorientation by sliding on the top.\n(b)\nEdge pivoting.\n(c)\nCorner pivoting.\nFigure 12\n:\nDifferent contact strategies in the 3D reorientation experiment.\nIX\nConclusion and Limitations\nWe introduced a hierarchical RL-MPC framework for contact-rich manipulation that explicitly separates geometric-kinematic planning from contact dynamics reasoning. The high-level RL policy predicts a\ncontact intention\n, including an object-surface contact location and a post-contact object-level subgoal, while a low-level contact-implicit MPC replans contact modes online with contact dynamics to robustly execute each intention. Across non-prehensile manipulation tasks, our approach achieves near-100% success with substantially improved data efficiency less than baselines, strong robustness, and zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.\nThe proposed approach has two main limitations. First, it relies on accurate object pose estimation for computing goal flow and MPC terms. Second, using a discrete keypoint set\n𝒫\n\\mathcal{P}\nsimplifies learning but scales poorly with multiple end-effectors due to the combinatorial action space. Future work will explore perception-native planning and extend the interface to multi-finger manipulation for scalable multi-fingered dexterous manipulation.\nReferences\n[1]\nS. Akella and M. T.

In the real-world testing with Franka robot arm, the robot is controlled by an OSC implemented in the panda-py library\n[\n13\n]\n. The controller executes at 500 Hz, enabling fast reaction to the end-effector displacement command during manipulation.\nIX-A\n2\nRobot Motion Planning for Contact Locations\nBetween contacts, the end-effector is lifted to disengage from the object and repositioned using OSC in free space. The OSC then guides the end-effector to the next intended contact location, where control switches back to the MPC for contact-rich interaction.\nIX-A\n3\nDistribution of Initial and Target Pose\nFor each task, the initial and target translation of\nx\n​\ny\nxy\ncoordinates are shown in Table\nIV\n. Note that we use (P) to stand for Geometry-generalized pushing and (R) to stand for 3D object reorientation, and use Abstract, Full-Sim, Full-Real to stand for abstract end-effector setting, full robot setting in simulation, and real-robot setting. Additionally, each pushing target orientation is a planar rotation with an random\n[\n−\n180\n∘\n,\n180\n∘\n]\n[-180^{\\circ},180^{\\circ}]\nangle about the\nz\nz\n-axis, and each flipping target is defined a fixed\n180\n∘\n180^{\\circ}\nrotation about the\nx\nx\n-axis, and an additional rotation with a random\n[\n−\n180\n∘\n,\n180\n∘\n]\n[-180^{\\circ},180^{\\circ}]\nangle about the z-axis.\nTABLE IV\n:\nInitialization and target distributions for all tasks.\nTask\nInit Translation (x × y)\nTarget Translation\nAbstract (P)\n[\n−\n0.25\n,\n0.25\n]\n2\n[-0.25,0.25]^{2}\nSame as init\nFull-Sim (P)\n[\n0.4\n,\n0.6\n]\n×\n[\n−\n0.1\n,\n0.1\n]\n[0.4,0.6]\\times[-0.1,0.1]\nSame as init\nFull-Real (P)\n[\n0.4\n,\n0.6\n]\n×\n[\n−\n0.3\n,\n0.3\n]\n[0.4,0.6]\\times[-0.3,0.3]\n[\n0.4\n,\n0.5\n]\n×\n[\n−\n0.1\n,\n0.1\n]\n[0.4,0.5]\\times[-0.1,0.1]\nAbstract (R)\n[\n−\n0.1\n,\n0.1\n]\n2\n[-0.1,0.1]^{2}\nSame as init\nFull-Sim (R)\n[\n0.4\n,\n0.6\n]\n×\n[\n−\n0.1\n,\n0.1\n]\n[0.4,0.6]\\times[-0.1,0.1]\nSame as init\nFull-Real (R)\n[\n0.45\n,\n0.5\n]\n×\n[\n−\n0.05\n,\n0.05\n]\n[0.45,0.5]\\times[-0.05,0.05]\nSame as init\nSuccess thresholds of all tasks are shown in Table\nV\n.

    "preview_text": "A key challenge in contact-rich dexterous manipulation is the need to jointly reason over geometry, kinematic constraints, and intricate, nonsmooth contact dynamics. End-to-end visuomotor policies bypass this structure, but often require large amounts of data, transfer poorly from simulation to reality, and generalize weakly across tasks/embodiments. We address those limitations by leveraging a simple insight: dexterous manipulation is inherently hierarchical - at a high level, a robot decides where to touch (geometry) and move the object (kinematics); at a low level it determines how to realize that plan through contact dynamics. Building on this insight, we propose a hierarchical RL--MPC framework in which a high-level reinforcement learning (RL) policy predicts a contact intention, a novel object-centric interface that specifies (i) an object-surface contact location and (ii) a post-contact object-level subgoal pose. Conditioned on this contact intention, a low-level contact-implicit model predictive control (MPC) optimizes local contact modes and replans with contact dynamics to generate robot actions that robustly drive the object toward each subgoal. We evaluate the framework on non-prehensile tasks, including geometry-generalized pushing and object 3D reorientation. It achieves near-100% success with substantially reduced data (10x less than end-to-end baselines), highly robust performance, and zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.\n\nWhere to Touch, How to Contact: Hierarchical RL–MPC Framework for Geometry-Aware Long-Horizon Dexterous Manipulation\nZhixian Xie\nYu Xiang\nMichael Posa\nWanxin Jin\nAbstract\nA key challenge in contact-rich dexterous manipulation is the need to jointly reason over geometry, kinematic constraints, and intricate, nonsmooth contact dynamics.

            "answer": "好的，作为一名专业的学术论文分析助手，我将基于您提供的论文《Where to Touch, How to Contact: Hierarchical RL-MPC Framework for Geometry-Aware Long-Horizon Dexterous Manipulation》及其引用的相关文献，梳理非抓取灵巧操作领域的发展脉络，并着重分析几个关键的发展方向。\n\n## 非抓取灵巧操作发展脉络梳理\n\n该领域的发展可以概括为从**基于模型的经典方法**，到**基于学习的端到端方法**，再到**结合模型与学习的层次化方法**的演进过程。每一步的改进都旨在解决前一类方法的根本性瓶颈。\n\n### 1. 经典方法：基于模型与运动基元\n*   **代表工作**： Lynch & Mason (1996) 的稳定推动分析， Akella & Mason (1998) 的多边形物体摆放。\n*   **核心思想**： 基于刚体力学和接触力学，对特定的操作任务（如推动、滑动）进行精确的建模和分析，设计出可证明稳定的控制器或运动基元。\n*   **改进与贡献**： 为领域奠定了坚实的理论基础，明确了接触模式（粘滞、滑动、分离）和摩擦锥等核心概念。\n*   **局限性**：\n    *   **可扩展性差**： 模型和控制器严重依赖于物体几何和任务假设，难以泛化到复杂形状或新任务。\n    *   **规划困难**： 接触动力学非光滑、混合，导致长时域规划（涉及多次接触建立与分离）的计算复杂度极高。\n\n### 2. 基于学习的端到端方法\n*   **代表工作**： 以强化学习（RL）或模仿学习（IL）直接学习从感知到动作的映射策略，如 HACMan (Zhou et al., 2023)， Diffusion Policy (Chi et al., 2025)。\n*   **核心思想**： 绕过复杂的物理建模，利用数据驱动的方式直接从经验中学习操作技能。希望模型能自动发现有效的接触策略。\n*   **改进与贡献**：\n    *   **减少人工建模**： 对复杂、难以解析建模的接触动力学有更好的适应性。\n    *   **灵活性高**： 理论上可以学习到非常多样和复杂的操作行为。\n*   **局限性（本文重点针对的问题）**：\n    *   **数据效率低**： 非光滑接触动力学使探索和信用分配困难，需要海量交互数据。\n    *   **仿真到现实迁移难**： 学习的策略过度拟合仿真器的特定物理参数（如摩擦、阻尼），对建模误差敏感。\n    *   **可解释性与泛化性弱**： 策略是一个“黑箱”，其决策逻辑不透明，在物体几何、任务目标变化时泛化能力有限。\n\n### 3. 模型与学习结合的层次化方法（当前主流方向）\n为了克服纯学习方法的缺陷，研究者开始探索将模型（先验知识）与学习（适应性）相结合的层次化架构。本文正是这一方向的最新进展。该方向内部又衍生出几个不同的发展路径：\n\n#### 发展方向一：**学习辅助模型预测控制**\n*   **核心思想**： 使用学习技术来**增强或简化基于模型的优化器（如MPC）**，而不是取代它。\n*   **演进与改进**：\n    1.  **学习动力学模型**： 早期工作（如 Shin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2025）用RL学习难以建模的对象（如可变形物体）的简化动力学模型，然后将其嵌入MPC。**改进在于**将学习范围限定在模型不确定部分，保留了MPC的可靠框架。\n    2.  **为优化器提供热启动或采样引导**： 如 Omer et al., 2021; Lopes et al., 2025 用学习策略为基于采样的MPC提供高质量的初始解，加速收敛。**改进在于**提升了复杂接触优化问题的求解效率。\n    3.  **学习高层“意图”以参数化底层MPC（本文的创新点）**： 本文提出的 **“接触意图”** 接口是这一思路的深化。与之前RL仅预测轨迹或辅助优化不同，本文让RL学习**几何-运动学层面**的抽象决策（“在哪里接触”、“达到什么物体位姿子目标”），而将**接触动力学层面**的复杂计算（“如何通过接触实现它”）完全交给一个通用的、基于物理的接触隐式MPC。\n        *   **关键改进**：\n            *   **解耦与泛化**： 将易于仿真的几何推理与难以仿真的接触动力学解耦，使高层策略的仿真到现实迁移更鲁棒。\n            *   **数据效率**： MPC承担了非光滑动力学优化的负担，RL只需在更平滑、更抽象的意图空间学习，极大提升了数据效率（论文称比端到端基线高10倍）。\n            *   **可解释性**： 决策过程被清晰地分层，便于分析和调试。\n\n#### 发展方向二：**基于搜索/采样的层次化规划**\n*   **核心思想**： 在高层使用搜索或采样方法（而非学习）来规划接触序列，底层使用模型进行轨迹生成或控制。\n*   **代表工作与改进**：\n    *   **PushAnything (Bui et al., 2025)**： 在高层**采样**可能的接触点，然后用MPC评估每个接触点的效果并执行最优者。**改进在于**实现了对未知物体的即时操作，但采样方式可能不够高效。\n    *   **HiDex (Cheng et al., 2023)**： 使用蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）进行接触选择，然后进行路径规划。**改进在于**通过搜索显式地推理长时域接触序列。\n    *   **与本文对比**： 这些方法依赖于在线搜索/采样，计算成本可能随问题复杂度增加而剧增。**本文用学习策略替代了在线搜索**，通过离线训练获得一个快速的高层决策器，实现了实时性能。\n\n#### 发展方向三：**完全基于学习的层次化策略**\n*   **核心思想**： 层次结构的两层都使用学习模型，但进行任务分解。\n*   **代表工作与改进**：\n    *   **HACMan (Zhou et al., 2023)**： 高层网络预测接触点，底层网络预测末端执行器的位移。两层均为神经网络。**改进在于**在纯学习框架内引入了接触选择的抽象层。\n    *   **HDP (Wang et al., 2025)**： 使用扩散模型分别生成接触点和轨迹。\n    *   **与本文对比**： 这些方法保持了“端到端”学习的灵活性，但**底层仍然需要学习接触动力学**，因此仍然面临数据效率、仿真到现实迁移的挑战。本文的**关键改进**在于用**基于物理模型的MPC**取代了学习的底层策略，从而从根本上获得了MPC的鲁棒性、对扰动的即时反应能力以及精确的物理一致性。\n\n## 总结\n非抓取灵巧操作的发展脉络清晰地展示了从**纯模型**到**纯学习**，再到**模型与学习深度融合**的趋势。本文提出的 **“RL-MPC + 接触意图”** 框架，代表了当前一个非常有力的发展方向：\n1.  **它继承了基于模型方法的物理精确性和鲁棒性**（通过底层MPC）。\n2.  **它吸收了学习方法的适应性和泛化能力**（通过高层RL策略处理多样几何和长时域规划）。\n3.  **它通过创新的“接触意图”接口**，实现了两个层次间清晰、高效的解耦，从而在数据效率、仿真到现实迁移和任务泛化方面取得了显著突破，是朝着构建**数据高效、鲁棒且通用**的灵巧操作系统迈出的关键一步。其局限性（如对精确感知的依赖、多指操作的组合爆炸问题）也为未来研究指明了方向。",

            "answer": "## 论文前作分析\n\n根据论文内容，作者团队（特别是Wanxin Jin和Michael Posa）在接触动力学建模与非抓取操作领域有一系列相关的前期工作。这些工作为本文提出的分层RL-MPC框架奠定了基础。以下是主要相关前作的梳理、对比及本文的具体改进。\n\n### 前作梳理与对比\n\n| 前作文献 | 核心贡献 / 方法 | 与本文 (`Where to Touch, How to Contact`) 的主要区别 | 本文的主要改进与创新点 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **PushAnything: single- and multi-object pushing from first sight with contact-implicit MPC** <br> (Bui et al., 2025) [5] | 提出一个**基于采样的规划框架**。给定物体点云，**随机采样**候选接触点，然后使用**接触隐式MPC**评估每个接触点推动物体的效果，选择最优者执行。 | 1. **决策机制不同**：前作采用**无模型采样+评估**，本文采用**学习型策略**预测接触意图。<br>2. **决策内容不同**：前作仅选择“在哪里接触”(`where`)，本文同时预测“接触后物体的子目标”(`what`)，形成完整的`Contact Intention`。<br>3. **效率与泛化性**：前作的随机采样在复杂几何和长时域任务上可能低效；本文的RL策略通过训练学习几何和运动学规律，能更高效地做出序列决策。 | **引入学习型高层策略**，将基于采样的开环搜索，转变为基于学习的闭环决策。这显著提升了长时域、多接触序列任务的数据效率和成功率。 |\n| **HiDex: Enhancing Dexterity in Robotic Manipulation via Hierarchical Contact Exploration** <br> (Cheng et al., 2023) [7] | 提出**分层接触探索**框架。高层使用**蒙特卡洛树搜索(MCTS)** 探索接触模式序列，低层使用**路径规划**生成无碰撞轨迹来执行每个接触。 | 1. **高层决策器不同**：前作使用**MCTS**进行规划，本文使用**强化学习(RL)** 训练策略。<br>2. **低层执行器不同**：前作使用**几何路径规划**，本文使用**基于物理模型的接触隐式MPC**。<br>3. **动态性处理**：前作的路径规划可能无法精细处理接触动力学（如滑动、滚动）；本文的MPC显式优化接触力与模式，对扰动更鲁棒。 | **用RL替代MCTS**，实现更快的在线决策；**用动态MPC替代几何规划**，使低层控制能主动利用和适应复杂的接触物理，实现了“如何接触”(`how`)的优化，提升了执行的鲁棒性和动态适应性。 |\n| **HACMan: Learning Hybrid Actor-Critic Maps for 6D Non-Prehensile Manipulation** <br> (Zhou et al., 2023) [66] | 提出一个**端到端的分层RL策略**。策略直接输出接触点选择及对应的末端执行器位移动作。整个策略（高层选择+低层动作）通过RL一次性训练完成。 | 1. **层次结构耦合度**：前作是**学习型分层**，但高低层都是神经网络，耦合紧密。本文是**学习-优化混合分层**，高层是RL，低层是模型优化(MPC)。<br>2. **物理模型利用**：前作完全依赖学习来掌握接触动力学，本文将动力学推理**卸载给基于物理模型的MPC**。<br>3. **数据效率与鲁棒性**：如论文实验所示，纯学习框架（HACMan风格）需要更多数据，且成功率和稳定性低于本文的RL-MPC混合框架。 | **解耦学习与优化**。将难以学习的非光滑接触动力学交给基于模型的MPC处理，RL只需学习相对简单的几何-运动学推理。这带来了**数据效率的显著提升**（论文中约10倍于端到端基线）和**更强的执行鲁棒性**（MPC高频重规划纠正误差）。 |\n| **Complementarity-free multi-contact modeling and optimization for dexterous manipulation** <br> (Jin, 2024) [25] | 提出了 **“互补性自由”(ComFree)** 接触动力学模型。该模型避免了传统的线性互补问题，提供了**闭式解**，从而实现了**高速的接触隐式模型预测控制(MPC)**。 | 1. **工作层级**：前作是**底层控制与优化方法**，本文是**完整的层次化操纵框架**。<br>2. **贡献性质**：前作是本文的**使能技术**（即本文低层MPC所使用的核心动力学模型与求解器）。 | **将ComFree-MPC集成到一个新颖的分层架构中**。本文的主要贡献不在于MPC本身，而在于设计了`Contact Intention`接口，将高层RL策略与这个高效的底层MPC连接起来，构建了一个完整且高效的操纵系统。 |\n| **Consensus complementarity control for multi-contact MPC** <br> (Aydinoglu et al., 2024) [2] | 研究**多接触MPC**的分布式优化与一致性控制问题，专注于多机器人或多指协调操纵场景下的控制算法。 | 1. **问题规模与焦点**：前作聚焦于**多接触点协同**的MPC算法本身。本文聚焦于**单接触点场景下的分层决策框架**，但为未来扩展到多指操作奠定了基础。<br>2. **框架角色**：前作可被视为本文低层MPC在多接触情况下的潜在扩展，但本文当前工作未涉及多指协调。 | 本文的**核心创新在高层接口和分层范式**。`Contact Intention`的设计是通用的，理论上可以扩展为多接触点（论文指出这是未来工作）。本文首先在单接触点任务上验证了该范式的巨大优势。 |\n\n### 总结：本文相对于前作的核心改进\n\n1.  **提出了统一的“接触意图”(Contact Intention)接口**：这是最核心的概念创新。它明确地将操纵任务分解为：\n    *   **高层 (RL)**：回答 **`Where to Touch` (几何)** 和 **`What to Achieve` (运动学子目标)**。\n    *   **低层 (MPC)**：回答 **`How to Contact` (接触动力学)**。\n    这一接口**清晰解耦了语义/几何推理与物理执行**，是之前工作所不具备的。\n\n2.  **构建了紧密耦合的“学习-优化”混合分层框架**：不同于纯采样规划(`PushAnything`)、纯搜索规划(`HiDex`)或纯学习分层(`HACMan`)，本文创造性地将**数据驱动的RL**与**模型驱动的MPC**深度融合。RL负责高层策略的泛化性，MPC负责底层控制的精确性与鲁棒性，两者通过`Contact Intention`参数化连接。\n\n3.  **实现了多项性能的显著提升**：\n    *   **数据效率**：得益于解耦，RL无需学习复杂动力学，训练数据量比端到端RL基线**减少约10倍**。\n    *   **鲁棒性与sim-to-real**：低层MPC基于物理模型进行高频重规划，能实时补偿模型误差和扰动，实现了**零样本的仿真到现实迁移**。\n    *   **任务性能**：在几何泛化推动和物体3D重定向任务上达到接近100%的成功率，且能泛化到未见过的物体几何形状。\n\n4.  **设计了针对性的学习组件**：为了高效学习`Contact Intention`，本文提出了：\n    *   **三元组物体中心观测空间**：联合编码几何、任务进度、碰撞可行性。\n    *   **双分支策略网络**：同时处理局部几何特征和全局运动学上下文。\n    这些设计确保了策略能有效进行几何感知的推理，如消融实验所证明。\n\n**总而言之，本文不是对前作中MPC或RL技术的简单应用，而是通过一个新颖的接口和框架设计，将它们系统性地整合起来，解决了“几何-运动学-动力学”联合推理的难题，从而在数据效率、鲁棒性和泛化能力上取得了突破性进展。**",

            "answer": "## 论文主要局限性分析\n\n根据论文结论部分（Section IX）及全文内容，本文提出的分层RL-MPC框架存在以下主要局限性：\n\n### 1. **对精确物体位姿估计的依赖**\n- **问题描述**：框架的核心组件（如计算目标流 `Δ𝒫_k` 和MPC优化项）严重依赖于对物体当前位姿 `𝒒^obj` 和最终目标位姿 `𝒒^target` 的精确估计。\n- **影响**：在真实世界中，感知噪声、遮挡或动态物体跟踪失败（如实验中字母“I”的个别失败案例）会直接导致高层策略决策错误和底层MPC控制失效，影响系统的鲁棒性。\n\n### 2. **离散关键点表示的可扩展性问题**\n- **问题描述**：高层RL策略的动作空间建立在从物体点云下采样的离散关键点集 `𝒫` 上。接触位置 `𝒄̄` 只能从这些预定义的关键点中选择。\n- **影响**：\n    - **精度限制**：接触位置的决策精度受限于关键点的采样密度和分布。\n    - **组合爆炸**：当应用于多指灵巧手（`n > 1`）时，需要为多个末端执行器同时选择接触点。动作空间大小将随关键点数量 `N` 和手指数量 `n` 呈组合增长（`C(N, n)`），导致训练和推理变得极其困难，限制了框架向更复杂多接触任务（如抓取、重排）的扩展。\n\n## 未来可能的改进方向\n\n针对上述局限性，论文在结论中提出了明确的未来工作方向，并隐含了其他潜在改进点：\n\n### 1. **开发感知-规划一体化方法**\n- **方向**：探索“感知原生规划”，旨在减轻对独立、高精度位姿估计模块的依赖。\n- **潜在方法**：\n    - 将原始视觉观测（如RGB-D图像）更直接地融入分层决策过程。\n    - 利用隐式表示或神经辐射场等新兴技术，使策略能基于更鲁棒的几何特征进行推理，而非依赖脆弱的显式位姿估计。\n\n### 2. **扩展至多指灵巧操作**\n- **方向**：将接触意图接口和分层框架推广到多指机器人手，实现真正的“灵巧”操作。\n- **挑战与思路**：\n    - **动作空间设计**：需要重新设计高层动作空间，以高效处理多接触点的组合选择问题。可能采用序列决策、结构化预测或引入连续参数化（如预测接触区域而非离散点）来缓解组合爆炸。\n    - **底层MPC**：需扩展ComFree-MPC模型，以同时优化多个接触点的力和运动，协调手指间的交互。\n\n### 3. **其他潜在改进方向（基于论文内容推断）**\n- **连续接触表示**：用连续参数（如物体表面的UV坐标、法向量）替代离散关键点集，提升接触选择的精度和灵活性。\n- **动态关键点/兴趣区域预测**：让高层策略能够动态预测或关注与当前任务最相关的物体区域，而非始终处理全部预定义关键点，提升计算效率和决策质量。\n- **模型与学习的进一步融合**：探索在MPC层引入学习成分（如学习残差动力学模型），以更好地处理未建模的接触物理，进一步提升sim-to-real的迁移能力和在复杂环境中的鲁棒性。\n\n**总结**：该论文的核心贡献在于通过**接触意图**这一接口清晰分离了几何运动推理与接触动力学推理，从而获得了数据高效、鲁棒且可迁移的性能。其局限性主要集中于**感知依赖**和**表示可扩展性**两方面，未来的改进也将围绕解决这两个核心问题展开，以推动框架走向更通用、更复杂的灵巧操作场景。",
