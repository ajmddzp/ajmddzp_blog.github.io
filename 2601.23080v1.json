transferred to the robot domain, and local defects may be amplified by closed-loop execution,\ncausing drift or failure in highly dynamic and contact-rich behaviors.\nWe propose a dynamics-conditioned

on the current dynamics.\nWe further integrate a fall recovery curriculum with random unstable initialization\nand an annealed upward assistance force to improve robustness and disturbance

page:\nhttps://zeonsunlightyu.github.io/RGMT.github.io/\nI\nIntroduction\nHumanoid robots are compelling largely because of their generality.\nTheir morphology is naturally compatible with human environments, allowing them to operate within existing infrastructure and manipulate tools,\nworkspaces, and interfaces designed for people.\nMoreover, their high-dimensional actuation and multi-contact capabilities support a broad spectrum of behaviors spanning locomotion, manipulation, and interaction\n[\n19\n,\n18\n,\n25\n,\n14\n,\n32\n,\n11\n,\n9\n,\n4\n,\n2\n,\n30\n]\n.\nTo translate this vision into reliable operation,\nit is necessary to develop a general whole-body controller that can coordinate the full body under changing contacts and task demands,\nwhile maintaining stable behavior over long horizons.\nHowever, this objective remains difficult to achieve in existing whole-body control research.\nHigh-fidelity imitation in practice still often relies on training for a single motion or a small set of motions\n[\n29\n,\n26\n,\n7\n,\n22\n]\n,\nwhich tightly couples policy capability to a specific reference distribution and limits unified modeling and generalization across skills.\nTo learn diverse humanoid motions within a single policy,\nrecent work has moved toward unified whole-body control that combines large-scale motion tracking objectives with broader motion coverage and more practical data acquisition.\nSeveral systems\n[\n8\n,\n13\n,\n28\n,\n12\n]\nfocus on scalable human to humanoid data collection and teleoperation,\nproviding richer and more diverse demonstrations for training.\nIn parallel, a number of motion tracking based controllers\n[\n3\n,\n31\n,\n27\n,\n5\n]\naim to directly train a universal tracker that can follow many motions under different disturbances.\nThese approaches demonstrate promising progress toward general whole-body controllers on humanoid robots,\nbut their tracking accuracy and closed loop stability remain suboptimal,\nespecially during highly dynamic maneuvers and rapid contact transitions.\nSONIC\n[\n15\n]\nfurther pushes motion coverage and naturalness,\nbut it relies on very large-scale data and training resources,\nusing more than 700 hours of motion data and substantial compute,\nwhich raises the barrier for iterative research and deployment.\nMoreover, long-horizon operation in the real world requires not only stable tracking but also recovery after disturbances or falls, yet fall recovery is often not integrated into the main control policy\n[\n11\n,\n9\n]\n, limiting robustness and safety.\nTherefore, we need a general whole-body control framework that can learn effectively under limited data, maintain stable closed-loop tracking under imperfect references, and jointly integrate robustness improvements for highly dynamic and multi-contact scenarios with fall recovery within a single training and policy pipeline, enabling safe and continuous real-world task execution.\nThis paper presents a learning framework for general humanoid whole-body control.\nThe key idea is to condition the policy on the current dynamics, enabling it to interpret and aggregate contextual commands selectively rather than treating all reference signals as equally reliable supervision.\nWe obtain a compact dynamics representation from recent proprioceptive history using a causal temporal encoder and use it to guide command aggregation via multi-head attention\n[\n24\n]\n.\nThis design allows the policy to adaptively select and adjust reference segments under feasibility constraints imposed by the current dynamics, reducing the impact of noise and artifacts, particularly for highly dynamic motions and frequent contact transitions.\nTo further support safe and continuous real-world operation, we incorporate fall recovery into the same training framework\n[\n11\n,\n9\n]\n.\nThis integration broadens the experienced state distribution, improves robustness to disturbances, and strengthens tracking performance for contact-rich motion segments.\nOur contributions are summarized as follows:\n•\nWe propose a dynamics-conditioned command aggregation framework that combines causal temporal dynamics encoding with multi-head cross-attention.\nThis design enables selective use of contextual commands under imperfect references and improves tracking accuracy and closed-loop stability in highly dynamic and contact-rich scenarios.\nThe resulting general policy is trained end-to-end using a compact dataset of about\n3.5\n3.5\nhours, without distillation or multi-stage training.\n•\nWe integrate fall recovery into a unified training framework. With randomized unstable initialization and an annealed external assistance force, a single policy learns stable control and self-recovery over a broader state distribution and contact conditions, leading to significantly improved robustness and disturbance rejection.\n•\nWe demonstrate strong generalization across diverse reference sources, including mocap, video-derived motions, and real-time full-body teleoperation.\nThe learned policy transfers zero-shot to unseen motions and deploys robustly on the Unitree G1, enabling stable long-horizon tracking with integrated recovery and downstream applications such as joystick-driven locomotion.\nFigure 2\n:\nOverview of the proposed whole-body control pipeline.\nA history encoder extracts a dynamics embedding from recent proprioception,\nwhich conditions a command encoder to aggregate the contextual command window.\nThe resulting representation is fused with the current observation and fed to an actor-critic policy trained with PPO,\nand the learned actor is deployed for real-world whole-body motion tracking and teleoperation.\nII\nMETHOD\nII-A\nHumanoid Motion Dataset\nOur motion corpus is constructed from LAFAN1\n[\n6\n]\nand a selected subset of AMASS\n[\n16\n]\n, and all sequences are retargeted to our humanoid using General Motion Retargeting\n[\n1\n]\n.\nIn practice, large-scale mocap sources\n[\n16\n]\nand their retargeted counterparts often exhibit substantial redundancy and may include segments with low motion quality and inconsistent contacts.\nWe therefore perform quality control to remove infeasible motions and low-quality sequences and to reduce redundancy, resulting in a relatively compact dataset of approximately\n3.5\n3.5\nhours.\nThis quality-driven construction is crucial for general humanoid motion tracking.\nEven when the raw corpus is large, effective supervision can be limited by duplicated motions and low-quality clips, which can distract optimization and reduce training efficiency.\nIn contrast, a smaller but diverse and higher-quality reference set provides cleaner and more informative supervision, improving generalization and closed-loop tracking accuracy.\nImportantly, enabled by our dynamics-conditioned command aggregation, this compact dataset is sufficient to train a strong general whole-body policy that is robust to noisy references and generalizes effectively to unseen motions.\nII-B\nMotion Tracking Formulation\nII-B\n1\nObservation Space\nOur policy receives an observation\n𝐨\nt\n\\mathbf{o}_{t}\nthat consists of a proprioceptive component and a command component.\nThe proprioceptive observation is\n𝐨\nt\n=\n[\n𝐠\nt\nproj\n,\n𝝎\nt\n,\n𝐪\nt\n−\n𝐪\n0\n,\n𝐪\n˙\nt\n,\n𝐚\nt\n−\n1\n]\n,\n\\mathbf{o}_{t}=\\Big[\\mathbf{g}^{\\mathrm{proj}}_{t},\\;\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_{t},\\;\\mathbf{q}_{t}-\\mathbf{q}_{0},\\;\\dot{\\mathbf{q}}_{t},\\;\\mathbf{a}_{t-1}\\Big],\n(1)\nwhere\n𝐠\nt\nproj\n∈\nℝ\n3\n\\mathbf{g}^{\\mathrm{proj}}_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}\ndenotes the gravity direction projected into the body frame,\n𝝎\nt\n∈\nℝ\n3\n\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}\nis the base angular velocity,\n𝐪\nt\n∈\nℝ\n29\n\\mathbf{q}_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{29}\nand\n𝐪\n˙\nt\n∈\nℝ\n29\n\\dot{\\mathbf{q}}_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{29}\nare joint positions and velocities,\n𝐪\n0\n\\mathbf{q}_{0}\nis the default joint configuration, and\n𝐚\nt\n−\n1\n∈\nℝ\n29\n\\mathbf{a}_{t-1}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{29}\nis the previous action.\nThe command observation provides per step reference targets extracted from the reference motion,\n𝐠\nt\n=\n[\n𝐯\nt\nref\n,\n𝝎\nt\nref\n,\n𝐠\nt\nref\n,\n𝐪\nt\nref\n]\n,\n\\mathbf{g}_{t}=\\Big[\\mathbf{v}^{\\mathrm{ref}}_{t},\\;\\boldsymbol{\\omega}^{\\mathrm{ref}}_{t},\\;\\mathbf{g}^{\\mathrm{ref}}_{t},\\;\\mathbf{q}^{\\mathrm{ref}}_{t}\\Big],\n(2)\nwhere\n𝐯\nt\nref\n∈\nℝ\n3\n\\mathbf{v}^{\\mathrm{ref}}_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}\nand\n𝝎\nt\nref\n∈\nℝ\n3\n\\boldsymbol{\\omega}^{\\mathrm{ref}}_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}\nare reference base linear and angular velocities expressed in the body frame,\n𝐠\nt\nref\n∈\nℝ\n3\n\\mathbf{g}^{\\mathrm{ref}}_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}\nis the reference gravity direction in the body frame, and\n𝐪\nt\nref\n∈\nℝ\n29\n\\mathbf{q}^{\\mathrm{ref}}_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{29}\nis the reference joint position at time\nt\nt\n.\nFor value learning, we adopt an asymmetric actor-critic training scheme.\nThe critic additionally takes a privileged observation that facilitates more accurate value estimation,\n𝐨\nt\npriv\n=\n[\nh\nt\nref\n,\n𝐱\nt\nlink\n,\n𝐯\nt\n]\n,\n\\mathbf{o}^{\\mathrm{priv}}_{t}=\\Big[h^{\\mathrm{ref}}_{t},\\;\\mathbf{x}^{\\mathrm{link}}_{t},\\;\\mathbf{v}_{t}\\Big],\n(3)\nwhere\nh\nt\nref\nh^{\\mathrm{ref}}_{t}\ndenotes the reference base height,\n𝐱\nt\nlink\n\\mathbf{x}^{\\mathrm{link}}_{t}\ndenotes body link poses, and\n𝐯\nt\n\\mathbf{v}_{t}\nis the base linear velocity.\nAccordingly, the critic input is\n𝐬\nt\n=\n[\n𝐨\nt\n,\n𝐠\nt\n,\n𝐨\nt\npriv\n]\n.\n\\mathbf{s}_{t}=\\Big[\\mathbf{o}_{t},\\;\\mathbf{g}_{t},\\;\\mathbf{o}^{\\mathrm{priv}}_{t}\\Big].\n(4)\nAll components of\n𝐬\nt\n\\mathbf{s}_{t}\nused by the critic are noise-free,\nwhile the actor receives noisy observations\n𝐨\nt\n\\mathbf{o}_{t}\n.\nII-B\n2\nAction Space and Low-level Control\nThe policy outputs a residual joint position command\n𝐚\nt\n∈\nℝ\n29\n\\mathbf{a}_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{29}\n.\nWe interpret\n𝐚\nt\n\\mathbf{a}_{t}\nas a corrective offset to the reference joint configuration and form the PD setpoint as\n𝐪\nt\ntar\n=\n𝐪\nt\nref\n+\n𝐚\nt\n.\n\\mathbf{q}^{\\mathrm{tar}}_{t}=\\mathbf{q}^{\\mathrm{ref}}_{t}+\\mathbf{a}_{t}.\n(5)\nJoint torques are computed by a joint-level PD controller,\n𝝉\nt\n=\n𝐊\np\n​\n(\n𝐪\nt\ntar\n−\n𝐪\nt\n)\n−\n𝐊\nd\n​\n𝐪\n˙\nt\n,\n\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{t}=\\mathbf{K}_{p}\\Big(\\mathbf{q}^{\\mathrm{tar}}_{t}-\\mathbf{q}_{t}\\Big)-\\mathbf{K}_{d}\\,\\dot{\\mathbf{q}}_{t},\n(6)\nwhere\n𝐊\np\n\\mathbf{K}_{p}\nand\n𝐊\nd\n\\mathbf{K}_{d}\nare diagonal gain matrices.\nThis residual formulation improves tracking accuracy by anchoring the PD setpoint to the reference motion while allowing corrective adjustments.\nIt also makes exploration more efficient, since the policy searches around the reference pose rather than over the full joint configuration space.\nAs a result, training becomes more sample efficient and converges faster in practice.\nII-B\n3\nReward Function\nFollowing\n[\n22\n]\n,\nwe adopt a dense reward that combines reference tracking with safety and smoothness regularization.\nWe define keypoints as a fixed set of links used in\n[\n22\n]\n,\nand formulate the tracking reward on these keypoints.\nSpecifically, the tracking part measures keypoint alignment, relative pose consistency,\nand keypoint velocity consistency with exponential kernels.\nThe regularization part penalizes rapid action changes, joint limit violations,\nand contacts on non-target body parts, which stabilizes learning and reduces physically implausible behaviors.\nII-C\nPolicy Learning Framework\nMulti-head attention (MHA)\n[\n24\n]\nprovides an effective mechanism for query-conditioned information fusion.\nIt computes content-based similarities between a query and a set of candidate features to produce adaptive aggregation weights,\nyielding a compact representation that emphasizes relevant elements while attenuating irrelevant or noisy ones.\nThe multi-head formulation performs this matching in multiple learned subspaces,\nallowing the model to capture diverse relevance cues in parallel and increasing expressiveness beyond a single attention map.\nThis capability is well suited to whole-body control, where command inputs are high dimensional and heterogeneous and may contain unreliable segments.\nIn practice, command sequences obtained from diverse sources often contain artifacts such as body penetration,\ninconsistent contacts, and high frequency noise. If the policy treats the entire command sequence as equally trustworthy supervision,\nabnormal segments can enter the representation with the same weight and be amplified in the action output,\nwhich can ultimately harm closed loop stability. Motivated by this observation,\nwe introduce dynamics-conditioned cross-attention in the policy architecture, as illustrated in Fig.\n2\n.\nA dynamics representation is first extracted from recent proprioceptive history using causal temporal encoding and used as the query signal,\nand the contextual command window is then aggregated with adaptive attention weights.\nThis design enables the policy to interpret and filter command information under physical feasibility constraints,\nreducing the influence of inconsistent reference signals on the control representation.\nII-C\n1\nHistory Encoder\nWe encode the most recent\n10\n10\n-step proprioceptive observations into a compact dynamics embedding.\nThe input sequence is\n𝐨\nt\n−\nK\n:\nt\n=\n[\n𝐨\nt\n−\nK\n,\n…\n,\n𝐨\nt\n]\n,\n\\mathbf{o}_{t-K:t}=\\big[\\mathbf{o}_{t-K},\\ldots,\\mathbf{o}_{t}\\big],\n(7)\nwhere each\n𝐨\nt\n∈\nℝ\n93\n\\mathbf{o}_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{93}\nand the sequence length is\nK\n+\n1\nK+1\n.\nEach observation is mapped to a token in an embedding space of dimension\nn\nembd\n=\n128\nn_{\\mathrm{embd}}=128\nby a two-layer multi-layer perceptron (MLP),\n𝐄\nt\n−\nK\n:\nt\n=\nMLP\n​\n(\n𝐨\nt\n−\nK\n:\nt\n)\n∈\nℝ\n(\nK\n+\n1\n)\n×\nn\nembd\n,\n\\mathbf{E}_{t-K:t}=\\mathrm{MLP}\\!\\left(\\mathbf{o}_{t-K:t}\\right)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{(K+1)\\times n_{\\mathrm{embd}}},\n(8)\nand a sinusoidal positional encoding is added to preserve temporal order,\n𝐄\n~\nt\n−\nK\n:\nt\n=\n𝐄\nt\n−\nK\n:\nt\n+\n𝐏\n,\n𝐏\n∈\nℝ\n(\nK\n+\n1\n)\n×\nn\nembd\n.\n\\tilde{\\mathbf{E}}_{t-K:t}=\\mathbf{E}_{t-K:t}+\\mathbf{P},\\qquad\\mathbf{P}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{(K+1)\\times n_{\\mathrm{embd}}}.\n(9)\nThe resulting token sequence is processed by a lightweight causal Transformer with multi-head self-attention.\nCausality is enforced by a causal mask so that the token at time\nτ\n\\tau\ncan attend only to tokens from times\n≤\nτ\n\\leq\\tau\nwithin the window.\nLetting\n𝐇\n(\n0\n)\n=\n𝐄\n~\nt\n−\nK\n:\nt\n\\mathbf{H}^{(0)}=\\tilde{\\mathbf{E}}_{t-K:t}\n, the causal self-attention block yields\n𝐇\n(\n1\n)\n\\displaystyle\\mathbf{H}^{(1)}\n=\n𝐇\n(\n0\n)\n+\nMHA\n​\n(\nLN\n​\n(\n𝐇\n(\n0\n)\n)\n)\n,\n\\displaystyle=\\mathbf{H}^{(0)}+\\mathrm{MHA}\\!\\left(\\mathrm{LN}\\!\\left(\\mathbf{H}^{(0)}\\right)\\right),\n(10)\n𝐇\n(\n2\n)\n\\displaystyle\\mathbf{H}^{(2)}\n=\n𝐇\n(\n1\n)\n+\nMLP\n​\n(\nLN\n​\n(\n𝐇\n(\n1\n)\n)\n)\n,\n\\displaystyle=\\mathbf{H}^{(1)}+\\mathrm{MLP}\\!\\left(\\mathrm{LN}\\!\\left(\\mathbf{H}^{(1)}\\right)\\right),\n𝐇\n¯\n\\displaystyle\\bar{\\mathbf{H}}\n=\nLN\n​\n(\n𝐇\n(\n2\n)\n)\n,\n\\displaystyle=\\mathrm{LN}\\!\\left(\\mathbf{H}^{(2)}\\right),\nwhere\nLN\n​\n(\n⋅\n)\n\\mathrm{LN}(\\cdot)\ndenotes layer normalization.\nFinally, we aggregate token features over time via element-wise max pooling to obtain the dynamics embedding\n𝐡\nt\n∈\nℝ\nn\nembd\n\\mathbf{h}_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n_{\\mathrm{embd}}}\n:\n𝐡\nt\n​\n[\nj\n]\n=\nmax\nτ\n∈\n{\nt\n−\nK\n,\n…\n,\nt\n}\n⁡\n𝐇\n¯\nτ\n​\n[\nj\n]\n,\nj\n=\n1\n,\n…\n,\nn\nembd\n.\n\\mathbf{h}_{t}[j]=\\max_{\\tau\\in\\{t-K,\\ldots,t\\}}\\bar{\\mathbf{H}}_{\\tau}[j],\\qquad j=1,\\ldots,n_{\\mathrm{embd}}.\n(11)\nThis embedding extracts the robot dynamics from recent proprioceptive history and is used as the query signal for the subsequent dynamics-conditioned command encoder.\nII-C\n2\nCommand Encoder\nThe command encoder compresses a contextual command window into a compact latent representation while conditioning the aggregation on the current dynamics.\nIts inputs are the dynamics embedding\n𝐡\nt\n∈\nℝ\nn\nembd\n\\mathbf{h}_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n_{\\mathrm{embd}}}\nand the command sequence\n𝐠\nt\n−\nL\n:\nt\n+\nL\n=\n[\n𝐠\nt\n−\nL\n,\n…\n,\n𝐠\nt\n+\nL\n]\n,\n\\mathbf{g}_{t-L:t+L}=\\big[\\mathbf{g}_{t-L},\\ldots,\\mathbf{g}_{t+L}\\big],\n(12)\nwhere each\n𝐠\nt\n∈\nℝ\n38\n\\mathbf{g}_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{38}\nand the window length is\n2\n​\nL\n+\n1\n2L+1\n.\nThe dynamics embedding is projected to the Transformer dimension through a two-layer multi-layer perceptron, yielding the query vector\n𝐪\nt\n=\nMLP\ndyn\n​\n(\n𝐡\nt\n)\n∈\nℝ\nn\nembd\n.\n\\mathbf{q}_{t}=\\mathrm{MLP}_{\\mathrm{dyn}}\\!\\left(\\mathbf{h}_{t}\\right)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n_{\\mathrm{embd}}}.\n(13)\nIn parallel, the command window is mapped to a token sequence in the same feature space using another two-layer multi-layer perceptron, and a sinusoidal positional encoding is added to preserve temporal order\n𝐙\n~\n=\nMLP\ncmd\n​\n(\n𝐠\nt\n−\nL\n:\nt\n+\nL\n)\n+\n𝐏\ncmd\n,\n𝐙\n~\n∈\nℝ\n(\n2\n​\nL\n+\n1\n)\n×\nn\nembd\n.\n\\tilde{\\mathbf{Z}}=\\mathrm{MLP}_{\\mathrm{cmd}}\\!\\left(\\mathbf{g}_{t-L:t+L}\\right)+\\mathbf{P}^{\\mathrm{cmd}},\\qquad\\tilde{\\mathbf{Z}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{(2L+1)\\times n_{\\mathrm{embd}}}.\n(14)\nThe encoder then applies a single dynamics-conditioned cross-attention block to aggregate the command tokens into a compact latent representation\n𝐬\n(\n1\n)\n\\displaystyle\\mathbf{s}^{(1)}\n=\n𝐪\nt\n+\nMHA\n​\n(\nLN\n​\n(\n𝐪\nt\n)\n,\n𝐙\n~\n)\n,\n\\displaystyle=\\mathbf{q}_{t}+\\mathrm{MHA}\\!\\left(\\mathrm{LN}\\!\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{t}\\right),\\,\\tilde{\\mathbf{Z}}\\right),\n(15)\n𝐬\n(\n2\n)\n\\displaystyle\\mathbf{s}^{(2)}\n=\n𝐬\n(\n1\n)\n+\nMLP\n​\n(\nLN\n​\n(\n𝐬\n(\n1\n)\n)\n)\n,\n\\displaystyle=\\mathbf{s}^{(1)}+\\mathrm{MLP}\\!\\left(\\mathrm{LN}\\!\\left(\\mathbf{s}^{(1)}\\right)\\right),\n𝐮\nt\n\\displaystyle\\mathbf{u}_{t}\n=\nLN\n​\n(\n𝐬\n(\n2\n)\n)\n∈\nℝ\nn\nembd\n.\n\\displaystyle=\\mathrm{LN}\\!\\left(\\mathbf{s}^{(2)}\\right)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n_{\\mathrm{embd}}}.\nThe resulting vector\n𝐮\nt\n\\mathbf{u}_{t}\nserves as a compact, dynamics-conditioned command embedding at time\nt\nt\n.\nBecause the cross-attention weights are conditioned on\n𝐡\nt\n\\mathbf{h}_{t}\nthrough the query\n𝐪\nt\n\\mathbf{q}_{t}\n, the encoder adaptively emphasizes command elements that are more consistent with the current dynamics and down-weights unreliable segments, thereby reducing the influence of abnormal command artifacts on the control representation.\nTABLE I\n:\nPerformance under different motion data sources.\nWe report mean\n±\n\\pm\nstandard

Recovery Integration\nAutomatic fall recovery is a key prerequisite for reliable humanoid deployment.\nWithout an effective self-recovery mechanism,\nthe system not only faces significant safety risks but also requires frequent human intervention,\nbreaking task continuity. This issue is particularly pronounced for whole-body motion tracking,\nwhere rapid dynamics and frequent contact transitions can amplify closed-loop errors and trigger instability.\nTherefore, we integrate a simple yet reliable automatic fall recovery mechanism into our whole-body control framework.\nII-D\n1\nRandomized Recovery Initialization\nWe designate a subset of the parallel environments as recovery environments with probability\n0.15\n0.15\nand reset the robot in these environments to randomized poses,\nexposing the policy to a broad range of unstable configurations and contact initial conditions.\nThis process also enriches contact experience during training,\nsince repeated falls and stand-ups naturally induce diverse ground-contact patterns,\nwhich improves tracking accuracy and generalization for motions with frequent or complex contact transitions.\nFor these recovery environments, we apply an upward pulling force with magnitude uniformly sampled from\n[\n0\n,\n200\n]\n[0,200]\nto assist exploration\nat early training stages by increasing the frequency of recoverable states.\nThe assistance is linearly annealed over training iterations and reduced to a negligible level,\nensuring that the final policy performs fall recovery using only its own control.\nII-D\n2\nTermination Conditions\nWe employ state-based episode termination and environment resets to maintain stable training and high-quality rollouts.\nFor all environments, an episode is reset either when it reaches a predefined time limit or when an instability event is detected.\nInstability is identified by three conditions: excessive base orientation deviation, insufficient base height, and abnormally low height of key body links.\nTo learn automatic fall recovery, we introduce an additional termination strategy for the recovery environments.\nWithin a predetermined recovery window of\n3\n3\nseconds, recovery environments are not terminated early by the instability criteria,\nallowing the policy to complete stand-up and re-stabilization within the same episode.\nIf the robot fails to recover within this window, the episode is terminated and the environment is reset,\navoiding prolonged rollouts in unrecoverable states and maintaining training efficiency.\nII-E\nTraining Setup\nWe train our policy in the Isaac Gym simulator\n[\n17\n]\n.\nAll training runs are conducted on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU with 5,680 parallel environments.\nWe train on approximately 3.5 hours of motion data curated from subsets of LAFAN1\n[\n6\n]\nand AMASS\n[\n16\n]\n,\nand observe strong generalization to previously unseen motions.\nThe proprioceptive history length is set to\nK\n=\n9\nK=9\n, and the command window half-length is set to\nL\n=\n10\nL=10\n.\nIII\nExperiments\nIn this section, we evaluate our approach on the 29 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) Unitree G1\n[\n23\n]\nhumanoid robot\nand demonstrate strong generalization and robustness in both simulation and the real world.\nWe conduct quantitative comparisons against representative baselines and targeted ablation studies to validate improved whole-body motion tracking performance\nand robustness to noise in command inputs.\nFinally, we deploy the learned policy on the physical robot to showcase reliable tracking and generalization across diverse motions,\nand demonstrate its applicability to downstream tasks such as real-time teleoperation and online motion generation.\nTABLE II\n:\nNoise specifications for command.\nCommand\nNoise Specification\nBase

noise.\nIII-A\nPerformance Evaluation\nIII-A\n1\nComparison with Baselines\nWe validate that the proposed approach learns a general motion tracker\nthat achieves stable and accurate tracking over a wide range of previously unseen motions.\nWe compare our method against two representative recent trackers, Any2Track\n[\n31\n]\nand GMT\n[\n3\n]\n,\nboth of which provide officially released models.\nTo ensure consistency and fairness, we directly use these models and evaluate all methods on the same datasets.\nAll methods are tested in MuJoCo\n[\n21\n]\n, which is supported by the above baseline implementations and provides a unified evaluation platform.\nA comprehensive set of metrics is adopted to capture both pose accuracy and physical feasibility.\nSpecifically, the success rate (Succ) is defined as the fraction of rollouts without falls,\nwhere a fall is identified when the root height deviates from the reference by more than\n0.2\n0.2\nm.\nIn addition, we report the mean per-joint position error (MPJPE)\nE\nMPJPE\nE_{\\mathrm{MPJPE}}\n(in mm),\nwhich measures the 3D position error of joints and quantifies joint-level tracking accuracy.\nTable\nI\n(a) compares baseline performance across three motion sources:\nMoCap data curated from subsets of LAFAN1 and AMASS, video-derived motions, and ground-interaction motions.\nThe MoCap subset comes from the same MoCap sources used to train all methods and thus measures in-distribution\ntracking performance. The video-derived motions are estimated from publicly available videos\nand cover common behaviors such as walking, dance, and martial arts.\nSince this subset is not used for training, it directly evaluates cross-source generalization.\nAcross all three subsets, our method achieves the highest success rate and the lowest\nE\nMPJPE\nE_{\\mathrm{MPJPE}}\n.\nThe improvement is most pronounced on the video-derived subset,\nwhere we substantially outperform GMT and Any2Track,\nindicating stronger robustness to distribution shifts in the reference motions.\nIII-A\n2\nAblations on Policy Architecture\nTable\nI\n(b) studies the effect of key design choices in our tracker.\nReplacing the causal history encoder with a CNN-based variant (\nOurs CNN HistEnc\n) consistently degrades performance across all three data sources,\nindicating that the causal history encoder contributes to stable and accurate tracking.\nReplacing the cross-attention command encoder with a self-attention variant (\nOurs SelfAttn CmdEnc\n) leads to a much larger performance drop,\nparticularly on the video-derived and ground-interaction subsets. This highlights the key role of dynamics-conditioned cross-attention in robust command aggregation under distribution shifts and command artifacts.\nIII-A\n3\nAblations on Fall Recovery\nTable\nI\n(c) studies the effect of integrating fall recovery during training.\nIncorporating fall recovery does not noticeably compromise tracking accuracy or generalization to unseen motions, as reflected by comparable performance on the MoCap and video-derived subsets.\nIn contrast, removing fall recovery training (\nOurs w/o Fall Recovery\n) substantially degrades performance on the ground-interaction subset, which includes contact-intensive behaviors such as crawling, kneeling, sitting, and breakdance-style motions.\nIn this setting, the success rate (Succ.) drops markedly and\nE\nMPJPE\nE_{\\mathrm{MPJPE}}\nincreases.\nThese results suggest that fall recovery not only provides self-recovery capability for safer long-horizon execution but also broadens contact experience during training, thereby improving robustness under complex ground interactions.\nIII-B\nRobustness Evaluation\nRobustness to command noise is essential for real-time teleoperation and generalization to unseen motions.\nIn practical applications, commands from human operators, motion estimation pipelines, or high-level planners are often noisy and subject to uncertainty.\nTo evaluate robustness under such conditions, we evaluate on the Charleston dance motion,\nwhich is included in the training set of all methods and has been showcased by both GMT and Any2Track.\nWe inject varying levels of noise into the reference commands to systematically assess the robustness of each method.\nThe noise specifications (base noise patterns) are summarized in Table\nII\n.\nWe define the noise level (%) by uniformly scaling the ranges in Table\nII\n.\nIn Fig.\n3\n, we report additional metrics beyond\nE\nMPJPE\nE_{\\mathrm{MPJPE}}\n.\nE\nMPKPE\nE_{\\mathrm{MPKPE}}\nmeasures the mean keypoint position error (in mm).\nTo assess physical fidelity,\nE\nvel\nE_{\\mathrm{vel}}\nand\nE\nacc\nE_{\\mathrm{acc}}\nmeasure the differences in keypoint velocities and accelerations relative to the reference motion,\nreported in mm/frame and mm/frame\n2\n, respectively.\nAs shown in Fig.\n3\n, baseline methods such as GMT and Any2Track degrade rapidly as the noise level increases.\nE\nMPJPE\nE_{\\mathrm{MPJPE}}\n,\nE\nvel\nE_{\\mathrm{vel}}\n, and\nE\nacc\nE_{\\mathrm{acc}}\nrise substantially, and the baselines struggle to maintain stable tracking when the noise level exceeds 200%.\nThese results suggest that, without an explicit mechanism to interpret and filter corrupted commands, baseline methods are more likely to amplify command noise in closed-loop execution, leading to instability at high noise levels.\nIn contrast, our method demonstrates significantly stronger robustness across all four metrics.\nEven at high noise levels, the errors remain relatively low and degrade much more gradually.\nAblation experiments further confirm this trend.\nReplacing the causal history encoder with a CNN-based variant consistently degrades robustness, confirming the importance of the causal history encoder.\nReplacing the cross-attention command encoder with a self-attention variant leads to a much larger degradation, especially in the high-noise regime, highlighting the cross-attention module as the key mechanism for filtering noisy commands.\nNotably, our full model maintains stable motion tracking even under noise levels up to 1500%, demonstrating strong tolerance to severe command corruption.\nOverall, these results highlight the central role of dynamics-conditioned cross-attention in filtering noisy commands and improving robustness, while the causal history encoder provides complementary benefits by stabilizing the dynamics representation used for command interpretation.\nIII-C\nReal-World Experiments\nFigure 4\n:\nReal-world dance tracking with fall recovery.\nIII-C\n1\nRobust Whole-Body Motion Tracking\nFig.\n4\nqualitatively illustrates two challenging behaviors enabled by our policy.\nIn the top row, the robot tracks a breakdance-style motion with frequent ground contacts and rapid contact transitions, demonstrating our policy’s ability to robustly coordinate whole-body motion under complex contact patterns.\nIn the bottom row, we apply an external push that causes the robot to fall. The policy autonomously executes a recovery maneuver and then resumes the motion-tracking task without manual resets, which improves robustness for long-horizon deployment and reduces the need for human intervention.\nIII-C\n2\nVideo-Derived Motion Tracking\nFig.\nLABEL:result\n(b) presents qualitative results on video-derived motions to evaluate generalization to unseen motions.\nFor these examples, the reference commands are produced by a video-based human motion estimation pipeline\n[\n20\n]\n, which introduces noise and distribution shift.\nDespite these challenges, our policy tracks the commanded motions on the real robot with high fidelity, reproducing the overall timing and whole-body coordination.\nThese results demonstrate effective transfer to previously unseen motion styles.\nIII-C\n3\nReal-Time Teleoperation\nWe develop a real-time full-body teleoperation pipeline with two different motion-tracking front ends: a consumer-grade PICO VR whole-body tracking interface and a wearable motion-capture suit.\nFor the PICO setup, the operator wears a VR headset, two ankle trackers, and handheld controllers, and the system outputs full-body pose estimates at runtime.\nFor the motion-capture suit setup, the suit streams full-body pose measurements online through its vendor SDK, which are converted to the same kinematic representation to ensure a unified downstream interface.\nIn both cases, the estimated human motion is streamed in real-time and transformed into our reference command representation\n𝐠\nt\n\\mathbf{g}_{t}\n, which is then consumed by the deployed actor together with proprioceptive observations.\nThis teleoperation setting is substantially noisier than offline MoCap due to sensing drift, latency, and operator inconsistency, and thus serves as a practical stress test of generalization and robustness.\nAs shown in Fig.\nLABEL:result\n(c) and (d), under both teleoperation sources, our policy remains stable and precisely tracks the incoming commands without manual resets, enabling challenging whole-body behaviors such as crawling, high kicks, and deep squats.\nIII-C\n4\nJoystick-driven locomotion\nFig.\n5\nillustrates a downstream integration of our tracker into a representative computer graphics motion synthesis method\n[\n10\n]\n.\nA handheld game joystick provides high-level locomotion commands, which are mapped to a sequence of reference motion targets and streamed to our policy as contextual commands.\nAlthough the synthesized reference sequence can exhibit abrupt transitions due to discrete clip-switching and matching artifacts, our policy remains stable and tracks the commanded base velocity in a stylized manner, producing coherent whole-body locomotion on the real robot.\nThis result suggests that our tracker can serve as a robust low-level controller for upstream motion generation modules, tolerating non-smooth reference trajectories while preserving responsive velocity tracking and motion style.\nFigure 5\n:\nJoystick-driven stylized locomotion.\nIV\nConclusion\nWe propose a whole-body motion tracking framework that achieves robust, generalized humanoid control with a single policy.\nBy conditioning command aggregation on a dynamics representation extracted from recent proprioception, the policy can down-weight inconsistent reference segments and remain stable under substantial command corruption.\nResults in simulation and on a 29-DoF Unitree G1 demonstrate accurate tracking across diverse motion sources, strong generalization to previously unseen motions, and reliable execution under complex contact patterns and external disturbances, enabling practical applications such as real-time teleoperation and joystick-driven locomotion.\nFuture work will incorporate global localization to enable long-horizon, world-frame consistent tracking, and expand integration with upstream motion generation and planning modules to support richer downstream tasks.\nReferences\n[1]\nJ.

    "detailed_summary": "## 论文摘要：《鲁棒且通用的人形机器人运动跟踪》\n\n**1. 研究背景和动机**\n人形机器人因其形态与人类环境兼容而具有巨大潜力，但开发一个能够协调全身、适应多变接触与任务的通用全身控制器仍面临挑战。现有方法通常存在以下问题：对特定运动数据依赖性强、闭环稳定性差（尤其在动态运动和频繁接触转换时）、需要海量数据训练，且缺乏有效的跌倒恢复机制，限制了其在现实世界中的鲁棒性和持续运行能力。\n\n**2. 核心方法和技术创新**\n本文提出了一个**动态条件命令聚合框架**，旨在利用有限数据训练出鲁棒、通用的全身控制策略。其核心创新包括：\n- **动态条件命令聚合**：使用一个**因果时序编码器**从近期本体感知历史中提取动态表征，并以此作为查询信号，通过**多头交叉注意力机制**选择性地聚合一个上下文命令窗口。这使得策略能根据当前物理可行性动态调整对参考命令的信任度，有效过滤噪声和不一致片段。\n- **集成式跌倒恢复课程**：在训练中集成跌倒恢复，通过随机不稳定初始化和退火辅助力，使单一策略同时学会运动跟踪和自主站起，显著提升了抗干扰能力和接触丰富场景下的鲁棒性。\n- **高效训练流程**：整个策略采用**端到端单阶段训练**，无需蒸馏或多阶段训练，仅需约**3.5小时**经质量筛选的运动数据。\n\n**3. 主要实验结果**\n在仿真和Unitree G1实体机器人上的实验表明：\n- **卓越的跟踪性能与泛化能力**：在MoCap、视频衍生运动等多种参考源上，其成功率和关节位置误差均显著优于基线方法（如GMT、Any2Track），并能零样本迁移到未见过的运动。\n- **强大的抗噪声鲁棒性**：在参考命令注入严重噪声（最高达1500%）的测试中，该方法性能下降平缓，而基线方法迅速失效，验证了动态条件聚合机制的有效性。\n- **成功的实物部署**：策略能稳定完成复杂动态运动（如霹雳舞）、从跌倒中自主恢复，并成功应用于实时全身遥操作和摇杆驱动 locomotion 等下游任务。\n\n**4. 研究意义和价值**\n本研究为实现**数据高效、鲁棒且通用**的人形机器人全身控制提供了切实可行的框架。其技术创新——动态感知的命令筛选与内置恢复能力——有效解决了实际部署中参考信号不完美和突发干扰的核心难题。该工作推动了人形机器人向在复杂、非结构化环境中进行**安全、连续、长期作业**迈出了关键一步，为后续与高层运动生成、规划模块的集成奠定了坚实基础。",

            "answer": "## 论文核心分析\n\n### **一、 研究问题**\n论文旨在解决**通用人形机器人全身运动跟踪**中的核心挑战：\n1.  **参考运动不完美**：从人类动作捕捉（MoCap）、视频估计或遥操作获得的参考运动，在迁移到机器人领域后常包含噪声、物理不一致（如穿透、接触错误）和局部缺陷。\n2.  **闭环稳定性差**：上述缺陷在闭环执行中会被放大，导致在**高动态**（如快速舞蹈）和**接触丰富**（如爬行、摔倒恢复）的行为中出现漂移或失败。\n3.  **数据与训练效率低**：现有方法（如SONIC）需要海量数据（>700小时）和计算资源，且常需多阶段训练或蒸馏，阻碍了迭代研究和部署。\n4.  **鲁棒性不足**：许多策略缺乏**集成化的摔倒恢复**能力，无法在扰动后自主恢复，限制了长期、安全的真实世界部署。\n\n### **二、 核心创新点**\n论文提出了一个名为 **“RGMT”** 的集成学习框架，其创新主要体现在以下三个方面：\n\n#### **1. 动态条件化的命令聚合框架**\n- **核心思想**：政策不应平等对待所有参考命令，而应根据**当前机器人动态状态**，有选择地聚合和解释上下文命令。\n- **关键技术**：\n    - **因果时序历史编码器**：使用一个轻量级因果Transformer，对最近10步的本体感知历史（关节状态、速度等）进行编码，提取出紧凑的**动态嵌入**，表征机器人当前的物理状态和趋势。\n    - **多头交叉注意力命令编码器**：以上述动态嵌入作为**查询**，对一个时间窗口内的参考命令进行**交叉注意力**聚合。这使得政策能够“关注”与当前动态相容的命令片段，并自动弱化不一致或不可行的噪声命令。\n- **价值**：显著提升了在噪声参考输入下的**跟踪精度**和**闭环稳定性**，特别是在高动态和接触频繁的场景中。\n\n#### **2. 集成化摔倒恢复课程**\n- **核心思想**：将摔倒恢复作为**同一政策训练流程的一部分**，而非独立模块，以扩大状态分布经验并提升鲁棒性。\n- **关键技术**：\n    - **随机不稳定初始化**：在训练中，以一定概率将环境重置为随机的不稳定姿态（如躺倒），迫使政策学习从各种摔倒状态中站起。\n    - **退火辅助力**：在训练早期施加向上的辅助力，帮助探索可恢复状态，随后线性退火至零，确保最终政策仅依靠自身控制完成恢复。\n    - **恢复窗口**：在恢复环境中设置短暂的不提前终止窗口，让政策有完整的机会学习站起序列。\n- **价值**：\n    - 使单一政策同时具备**运动跟踪**和**自主恢复**能力。\n    - 通过接触丰富的恢复过程，间接提升了政策在处理复杂地面交互运动时的**鲁棒性和泛化能力**。\n\n#### **3. 高效的数据利用与端到端训练**\n- **数据**：仅使用约**3.5小时**经过质量筛选的多样化运动数据（来自LAFAN1和AMASS），远少于同类工作。\n- **训练**：支持**单阶段端到端训练**，无需复杂的蒸馏或多阶段 pipeline，降低了训练复杂度和资源需求。\n- **价值**：证明了通过**精巧的架构设计**和**课程学习**，可以用小数据集训练出强大、通用的全身控制器，降低了研究与应用门槛。\n\n### **三、 解决方案总结**\n论文通过一个**统一的、以动态感知为核心的策略架构**，结合**集成化的鲁棒性训练课程**，系统性地解决了上述问题：\n\n1.  **针对不完美参考**：利用**动态条件化的交叉注意力机制**作为“过滤器”，使政策能自适应地依赖可靠的命令，抑制噪声和伪影。\n2.  **针对闭环不稳定**：上述机制从源头减少了错误命令的放大；同时，**摔倒恢复课程**让政策经历了更广的（包括不稳定的）状态分布，增强了其抗扰动和维持稳定的能力。\n3.  **针对效率与泛化**：紧凑但高质量的数据集，配合端到端训练，实现了高效学习。在实验中展现了强大的**零样本泛化**能力（对未见过的视频估计运动）和**仿真到实物的转移**能力。\n\n**实际价值**：该框架成功在Unitree G1人形机器人上实现了：\n- 对多样来源（MoCap、视频、实时遥操作）运动的高保真、鲁棒跟踪。\n- 在外部推动下的自主摔倒恢复与任务续行。\n- 下游应用集成，如摇杆驱动的风格化 locomotion。\n这为人形机器人在非结构化环境中进行长期、安全、连续的任务执行提供了可行的通用底层控制器方案。",

            "answer": "## 论文分析：稳健且通用的人形机器人运动跟踪\n\n### 一、 核心问题与总体贡献\n\n本文旨在解决**通用人形机器人全身控制**中的核心挑战：在参考运动存在噪声、不一致性，且闭环执行可能放大局部缺陷的情况下，实现**稳定、鲁棒且可泛化**的运动跟踪。\n\n**主要贡献**：\n1.  **提出动态条件化命令聚合框架**：利用因果时序编码器总结近期本体感知，并通过多头交叉注意力命令编码器，根据当前动态有选择地聚合上下文窗口中的命令。这使得策略能够“智能”地过滤不可靠的参考信号。\n2.  **集成跌倒恢复课程**：通过随机不稳定初始化和退火式向上辅助力，将跌倒恢复训练统一到主策略学习中，显著提升了鲁棒性和抗干扰能力。\n3.  **实现高效训练与强大泛化**：仅需约 **3.5小时** 的高质量运动数据，支持**单阶段端到端训练**（无需蒸馏）。策略在多种噪声参考输入和挑战性运动模式下均表现优异，实现了对未见运动的**零样本泛化**以及从仿真到实物的**鲁棒迁移**。\n\n### 二、 技术脉络与发展方向梳理\n\n基于本文及其引用的相关工作，该领域（数据驱动的通用人形全身运动跟踪）的发展脉络可梳理为以下几个相互交织的方向：\n\n#### **方向一：从“专精”到“通用”——策略学习范式的演进**\n\n*   **早期工作（专精化模仿）**：如 `HuB`、`KungfuBot`、`ASAP` 等，通常针对**单一或少量特定技能**（如平衡、高动态技能）进行训练。其策略能力与特定的参考运动分布紧密耦合，**泛化能力有限**，难以统一建模多种技能。\n*   **近期进展（通用跟踪器）**：如 `GMT`、`Any2Track`、`UniTracker` 及本文工作，目标转向训练一个**通用跟踪器**，使其能够跟随多种多样的参考运动。这需要更大规模、更多样化的运动数据作为监督信号。\n    *   **改进**：从“一技能一模型”走向“多技能一模型”，提高了策略的通用性和实用性，为构建统一的全身控制器奠定了基础。\n\n#### **方向二：数据规模与质量的权衡——从“海量”到“精选”**\n\n*   **数据驱动趋势**：为了学习通用策略，收集大规模人形机器人运动数据成为关键。`OmniH2O`、`CLONE`、`TWIST2`、`ExBody2` 等工作聚焦于**可扩展的人-人形数据采集与遥操作**系统，提供了更丰富、更多样化的演示数据。\n*   **数据效率挑战**：`SONIC` 等工作展示了使用超大规模数据（>700小时）和算力所能达到的极致自然运动效果，但**门槛极高**，不利于迭代研究和部署。\n*   **本文的改进**：本文反其道而行之，强调**数据质量优于单纯数量**。通过对原始动作捕捉数据进行严格的**质量控制、去冗余和筛选**，构建了一个仅 **3.5小时** 但高质量、多样化的紧凑数据集。结合其创新的网络架构，证明了在有限数据下也能训练出强大的通用策略，**显著降低了数据与计算成本**。\n\n#### **方向三：架构创新与鲁棒性提升——从“盲从”到“条件化理解”**\n\n*   **基线方法局限**：`GMT`、`Any2Track` 等通用跟踪器，通常将参考命令序列作为固定输入，策略平等地对待所有时间步的参考信号。当参考命令存在噪声、不一致接触或伪影时，这种“盲从”容易在闭环中放大错误，导致**跟踪精度下降和失稳**。\n*   **本文的核心创新（动态条件化命令聚合）**：\n    1.  **因果历史编码器**：提取近期本体感知的动态嵌入，作为对当前机器人物理状态的紧凑表示。\n    2.  **多头交叉注意力命令编码器**：以动态嵌入为 **Query**，对上下文命令窗口进行 **Key-Value** 检索与聚合。这使得策略能够根据**当前的物理可行性**，自适应地**关注或忽略**参考命令的不同部分。\n    *   **改进**：引入了对参考命令的“理解”和“过滤”能力。策略不再是简单地跟踪参考，而是在物理约束下**有选择地遵从**参考，从而对噪声和伪影表现出极强的**鲁棒性**（实验显示可容忍高达1500%的噪声）。\n\n#### **方向四：安全与持续运行——从“孤立控制”到“集成恢复”**\n\n*   **传统局限**：许多全身控制策略专注于运动跟踪本身，**跌倒恢复通常作为一个独立的模块或事后补救措施**（如 `Learning getting-up policies`、`Learning humanoid standing-up control`）。这限制了系统的整体鲁棒性和任务连续性，一旦跌倒需要人工干预。\n*   **本文的集成方案**：\n    *   **训练集成**：在训练中，以一定概率将环境初始化为随机不稳定姿态，并施加退火的向上辅助力，让**单一策略同时学习运动跟踪和自主站起**。\n    *   **改进**：\n        1.  **提升安全性**：策略具备内在的跌倒恢复能力，支持**长时程、无需人工重置**的连续运行。\n        2.  **间接提升跟踪性能**：恢复过程让策略经历了更广泛的接触状态和动力学分布，反而**增强了其在复杂接触运动（如地面交互动作）中的跟踪鲁棒性**（消融实验证实）。\n\n#### **方向五：应用场景拓展——从“离线跟踪”到“在线交互”**\n\n*   **早期验证**：多在仿真或受控环境中跟踪干净的预录动作捕捉数据。\n*   **本文展示的泛化能力**：\n    *   **输入源泛化**：成功跟踪来自**视频估计**（噪声大、有分布偏移）和**实时全身遥操作**（存在延迟、抖动）的参考命令。\n    *   **任务集成**：作为底层控制器，与上游模块（如基于游戏手柄的**运动合成方法**）集成，实现**遥操作驱动**和**交互式风格化运动**，展示了其在**实际下游任务**中的应用潜力。\n\n### 三、 总结\n\n本文代表了一个清晰的演进方向：在追求通用人形控制的过程中，从依赖**海量数据**和**孤立模块**，转向依靠**精巧的算法架构**（动态条件化注意力）和**一体化的训练范式**（集成恢复课程），在**保证数据效率的同时，极大地提升了策略的鲁棒性、泛化能力和实际部署的实用性**。它为解决“如何让机器人像人一样灵活、稳定地运动”这一核心问题，提供了一个高效且强大的框架。未来的工作预计将在此基础上，进一步结合全局定位、更高级别的运动生成与规划，以支持更复杂的长期任务。",

            "question": "论文的主要局限性有哪些？未来可能的改进方向是什么？",
            "answer": "## 论文主要局限性分析\n\n根据论文内容，该研究在取得显著成果的同时，也存在一些局限性，主要集中在以下几个方面：\n\n- **缺乏全局定位与长期一致性**：论文在结论部分明确指出，当前的框架**缺乏全局定位能力**。这意味着机器人的运动跟踪是在本体坐标系下进行的，无法在长时间、大范围的执行中保持与世界坐标系的一致性。这限制了其在需要精确全局导航或长期任务规划场景中的应用。\n\n- **对上游运动生成模块的依赖与容忍度**：虽然论文展示了与运动合成方法（如基于游戏手柄的 locomotion）的集成，并表现出对非平滑参考轨迹的鲁棒性，但这种集成仍然是初步的。框架**对上游模块产生的运动质量（如逻辑一致性、物理可行性）的主动理解和修正能力有限**。当前方法主要通过“过滤”噪声来应对，但无法从根本上纠正基于错误先验生成的、整体不合理的运动指令。\n\n- **数据与训练的特定性**：\n    - **数据质量依赖**：尽管仅使用了约3.5小时数据，但论文强调了对数据进行严格**质量控制和去冗余**的重要性。这表明方法的性能在一定程度上依赖于精心筛选的、高质量、多样化的训练数据。对于更嘈杂、质量更低的原始数据源，其有效性可能下降。\n    - **仿真到现实的差距**：虽然实现了Sim-to-Real转移，但训练完全在仿真中进行。仿真环境（Isaac Gym）的物理模型与真实世界必然存在差异，这可能会限制策略在极端未见过动态或复杂接触场景（如柔软、不平整地面）下的表现。\n\n- **计算架构与实时性**：论文中使用了因果Transformer和交叉注意力机制，虽然有效，但相比更简单的网络结构，**带来了额外的计算开销**。在需要极低延迟的实时应用（如高速动态平衡）中，这可能成为一个瓶颈。论文未详细讨论策略在边缘计算设备上的部署效率。\n\n---\n\n## 未来可能的改进方向\n\n基于上述局限性，论文在结论和实验分析中也暗示或明确提出了未来的工作方向：\n\n1.  **集成全局状态估计与规划**：\n    ```python\n    # 未来框架可能扩展的输入\n    future_observation = [proprioception, command_window, global_pose, map_info]\n    ```\n    这是论文明确指出的方向：**引入全局定位（如SLAM、VIO）**，使策略能感知自身在世界中的位置和朝向。这将支持长视野、跨房间的任务执行，并实现与世界物体的交互（如走向并操作特定物体）。\n\n2.  **与上游模块的深度耦合与联合优化**：\n    - **双向通信**：不仅下游控制器容忍上游噪声，还可以向上游模块**反馈当前动态可行性信息**，指导其生成更易执行的运动。例如，构建一个“运动可行性评估”模块。\n    - **端到端学习**：将运动生成（如基于语言或视频的指令解析）与底层跟踪控制**在一个联合框架中进行训练**，使生成的运动在源头就考虑机器人的物理约束。\n\n3.  **增强数据多样性与仿真真实性**：\n    - **扩充数据集**：纳入更多极端、挑战性的运动（如摔倒、剧烈对抗干扰），以及在不同地面材质（沙地、碎石）上的运动数据，进一步提升泛化能力。\n    - **高保真仿真**：利用**域随机化**和**系统辨识**技术，缩小仿真与现实的差距。也可以探索**在线自适应**技术，让机器人在真实世界中持续微调策略。\n\n4.  **架构与效率优化**：\n    - **模型轻量化**：研究更高效的注意力机制（如线性注意力）、知识蒸馏或网络剪枝技术，在保持性能的同时降低计算负载，便于在机器人本体计算单元上部署。\n    - **分层与模块化设计**：将“动态感知”、“命令过滤”、“关节控制”等功能模块化，提高系统的可解释性和可维护性，并允许单独改进某个模块。\n\n5.  **拓展任务范围**：\n    - 从纯运动跟踪扩展到**包含物体操作的全身协调任务**（Loco-Manipulation）。这需要引入对物体状态的观测和操作语义。\n    - 探索在**非结构化动态环境**（如人群中行走）中的鲁棒性，这需要处理更复杂的外部干扰和不确定性。\n\n**总结**：该论文的核心局限性在于其“跟踪器”的定位——它出色地完成了“如何执行”给定运动指令的任务，但在“执行什么”和“在何处执行”的更高层决策与规划方面能力有限。未来的改进将主要围绕**赋予机器人环境感知、任务理解和长期自主决策能力**展开，同时持续优化基础跟踪的鲁棒性、效率与泛化边界。",
