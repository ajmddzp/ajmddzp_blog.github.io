This paper introduces HumanoidVLM, a vision–language driven retrieval framework that enables the Unitree G1 humanoid to select task-appropriate cartesian impedance parameters and gripper configurations directly from an ego-centric RGB image. The system couples a vision–language model for semantic task inference with a FAISS-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that retrieves experimentally validated stiffness–damping pairs and object-specific grasp angles from two custom databases, and executes them through a task-space impedance controller for compliant manipulation. We evaluate HumanoidVLM on 14 visual scenarios and achieve a retrieval accuracy of 93%. Real-world experiments show stable interaction dynamics, with\nz\nz\n-axis tracking errors typically within\n1\n​\n–\n​\n3.5\n1\\text{--}3.5\ncm and virtual forces consistent with task-dependent impedance settings. These results demonstrate the feasibility of linking semantic perception with retrieval-based control as an interpretable path toward adaptive humanoid manipulation.\nHuman-Robot Interaction, Vision Language Model, Retrieval-Aug-mented System, Task-Space compliance, impedance control\n†\n†\nccs:\nHuman-centered computing Collaborative interaction\n†\n†\nccs:\nComputing methodologies Vision for robotics\n†\n†\nccs:\nComputer systems organization Robotic control\n1.\nIntroduction\nHumanoid robots are increasingly expected to operate in unstructured human environments, where tasks such as placing objects, applying force on surfaces, grasping diverse items, or manipulating tools require a combination of semantic understanding and compliant physical interaction\n(Bicchi and Kumar,\n2000\n)\n. Conventional control pipelines for such systems typically rely on fixed, hand-tuned impedance gains\n(Hogan,\n1985\n)\nand manually specified gripper configurations, which restrict the robot’s ability to adapt to changes in scene geometry, object properties, or task intent.\nIn parallel, recent advances in Vision–Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in open-world perception, contextual reasoning, and grounded language understanding\n(Alayrac et al\n.\n,\n2022\n)\n, making them promising candidates for high-level task inference in robotics\n(Brohan et al\n.\n,\n2023\n)\n. However, despite their strong semantic understanding, these models remain largely disconnected from the low-level control parameters that determine how a robot physically interacts with its environment. As a result, current humanoid systems lack the capacity to autonomously translate visual semantics into actionable, task-appropriate interaction behaviors—a limitation that is especially pronounced in contact-rich manipulation tasks, where selecting correct stiffness, damping, and grasping configurations is essential for safe and stable execution.\nTo bridge this gap, we introduce HumanoidVLM, a retrieval-augmented vision–language framework that connects high-level visual reasoning with low-level manipulation parameters for the Unitree G1 humanoid robot. Given a single egocentric image, HumanoidVLM infers the ongoing manipulation task through structured visual queries and retrieves the corresponding cartesian impe-dance parameters and object-specific gripper angle from custom, experimentally validated databases. This approach enables the robot to autonomously determine task-appropriate compliance settings for a given scene.\n2.\nRelated Works\nFoundation models and semantic manipulation.\nRecent advances in foundation models have accelerated progress in semantic manipulation and scene-aware task execution. OmniVIC\n(Zhang et al\n.\n,\n2025\n)\nand ImpedanceGPT\n(Batool et al\n.\n,\n2025\n)\nare most closely related to our approach, combining a vision–language model with a variable impedance controller through retrieval. However, OmniVIC focuses on industrial arms and does not address humanoid embodiment, shared workspaces, or HRI-oriented safety. Vision–language–action systems such as PG-VLM\n(Gao et al\n.\n,\n2024\n)\n, SayCan\n(Ahn et al\n.\n,\n2023\n)\n, RT-2\n(Zitkovich et al\n.\n,\n2023\n)\n,Bi-VLA\n(Gbagbe et al\n.\n,\n2024\n)\n, and SwarmVLM\n(Zafar et al\n.\n,\n2025\n)\nshow that multimodal models can generalize manipulation behavior, but these frameworks operate at the policy or pose level and rely on fixed impedance gains. Broader surveys on foundation models for manipulation and robot intelligence\n(Li et al\n.\n,\n2025\n)\n,\n(Jeong et al\n.\n,\n2024\n)\nhighlight the role of semantic reasoning but do not consider continuous impedance modulation in humanoid settings. Work on foundation models for collaborative assembly\n(Ji et al\n.\n,\n2024\n)\nemphasizes contextual reasoning in shared autonomy, yet compliant control remains largely unaddressed.\nImpedance and variable impedance control.\nClassical impe-dance control, introduced by Hogan\n(Hogan,\n1985\n)\n, provides a structured formulation for regulating robot–environment interaction through stiffness and damping shaping. Surveys by Abu-Dakka and Saveriano\n(Abu-Dakka and Saveriano,\n2020\n)\ndocument advances in variable impedance strategies, including learning-based adaptation and physical interaction applications. In human–robot collaboration, Ajoudani\net al.\n(Ajoudani et al\n.\n,\n2018\n)\nstress the importance of compliance modulation for safety and ergonomics, following earlier studies on tactile and impedance-based interaction in humanoid systems\n(Tsetserukou et al\n.\n,\n2008\n)\n. Building on this foundation, our work links semantic scene understanding to impedance and gripper selection through retrieval-augmented reasoning, enabling task-aware compliant control on a humanoid.\n3.\nSystem Architecture\nThe proposed system enables the Unitree G1 humanoid to adapt its end-effector impedance and grasping behavior using visual scene understanding and retrieval-based reasoning. An ego-centric RGB image from the robot’s head camera is processed by a vision–language model (VLM), which infers the high-level manipulation task through structured visual queries. The resulting semantic task label is embedded and passed to a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that performs FAISS-based similarity search over two custom databases: (i) a cartesian impedance database storing task-specific stiffness and damping coefficients for the end-effector, and (ii) a gripper-angle database specifying the optimal grasp configuration for the object category.\nThe retrieved control parameters (\nK\nK\n,\nD\nD\n, and gripper angle\nγ\n\\gamma\n) are transmitted to the onboard G1 computer, where a task-space cartesian impedance controller generates compliant end-effector trajectories. These desired virtual poses are then converted into joint targets through inverse kinematics and executed using the robot’s built-in position controllers. Fig.\n1\nprovides an overview of the perception, reasoning, and control pipeline.\n3.1.\nVLM–RAG System\nThe VLM–RAG system processes the ego-centric view using the Molmo-7B-O BnB 4-bit model\n(mol,\n2025\n)\nto identify the task-relevant objects and scene context. The visual output is converted into a multimodal representation and embedded using the\nall-MiniLM-L6-v2\nsentence-transformer\n(sen,\n2025\n)\n, enabling semantically meaningful retrieval within a shared vector space. Given an input image, the VLM determines the task through sequential yes/no queries. The RAG system then retrieves the corresponding impedance and gripper parameters, providing the controller with context-dependent gains for safe and adaptive manipulation.\n3.1.1.\nCustom Database for Environmental Scenarios\nThe database contains nine manipulation tasks, each associated with experimentally validated cartesian impedance parameters and an optimal gripper configuration. Impedance parameters include stiffness coefficients\nK\n=\n[\nK\nx\n,\nK\ny\n,\nK\nz\n]\nK=[K_{x},K_{y},K_{z}]\nand damping coefficients\nD\n=\n[\nD\nx\n,\nD\ny\n,\nD\nz\n]\nD=[D_{x},D_{y},D_{z}]\n, which determine how the end-effector regulates contact forces and compliance along the cartesian axes. Each entry also specifies a preferred gripper angle\nγ\na\n\\gamma_{a}\nfor secure manipulation of the corresponding object type.\nThe retrieval system relies on two JSON databases. The impedance database stores task-specific cartesian impedance parameters collected from real-world experiments on the G1 humanoid. Multiple settings were tested per task, and the most stable and compliant configuration was recorded as the canonical entry. The gripper database contains experimentally determined optimal closing angles for manipulating rigid, soft, deformable, or fragile objects. These angles were obtained through repeated trials and represent secure yet compliant grasp strategies.\nTogether, these two databases map a semantic task label to its corresponding control variables, namely the cartesian impedance parameters and the gripper configuration, forming the knowledge base of the RAG module.\n3.2.\nRobot Control\n3.2.1.\nEnd-effector Impedance Control\nThe Unitree G1 does not provide wrist force–torque sensing, and its two-finger grippers lack reaction wrench feedback. To enable compliant interaction without force sensors, we adopt a homogeneous cartesian mass–spring–damper model in task space. Each end-effector is regulated as a 6-DoF point following a desired pose trajectory, which acts as a virtual reference for the impedance dynamics.\nThe translational impedance parameters\n𝐊\n\\mathbf{K}\nand\n𝐃\n\\mathbf{D}\nare selected by the VLM–RAG system, while the virtual mass\n𝐌\n\\mathbf{M}\nand rotational impedance remain fixed for stability. For each arm\na\n∈\n{\nL\n,\nR\n}\na\\in\\{L,R\\}\n, let\n𝐱\na\n∈\nℝ\n3\n\\mathbf{x}_{a}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}\nand\n𝐑\na\n∈\nS\n​\nO\n​\n(\n3\n)\n\\mathbf{R}_{a}\\in SO(3)\ndenote the current end-effector position and\norientation, and let\n𝐱\na\n,\nref\n,\n𝐑\na\n,\nref\n\\mathbf{x}_{a,\\mathrm{ref}},\\mathbf{R}_{a,\\mathrm{ref}}\ndenote the desired reference pose. We define diagonal virtual mass, damping, and stiffness matrices:\n(1)\n𝐌\na\n\\displaystyle\\mathbf{M}_{a}\n=\ndiag\n​\n(\nM\na\n,\nx\n,\nM\na\n,\ny\n,\nM\na\n,\nz\n)\n,\n\\displaystyle=\\mathrm{diag}(M_{a,x},M_{a,y},M_{a,z}),\n𝐃\na\n\\displaystyle\\mathbf{D}_{a}\n=\ndiag\n​\n(\nD\na\n,\nx\n,\nD\na\n,\ny\n,\nD\na\n,\nz\n)\n,\n\\displaystyle=\\mathrm{diag}(D_{a,x},D_{a,y},D_{a,z}),\n𝐊\na\n\\displaystyle\\mathbf{K}_{a}\n=\ndiag\n​\n(\nK\na\n,\nx\n,\nK\na\n,\ny\n,\nK\na\n,\nz\n)\n.\n\\displaystyle=\\mathrm{diag}(K_{a,x},K_{a,y},K_{a,z}).\nFor each arm\na\na\n, the translational error is defined as in (2), the impedance dynamics follow the second order ODE (3), and the resulting virtual force is given by (4).\n(2)\n𝐞\na\n=\n𝐱\na\n,\nref\n−\n𝐱\na\n,\n𝐞\n˙\na\n=\n𝐱\n˙\na\n,\nref\n−\n𝐱\n˙\na\n\\mathbf{e}_{a}=\\mathbf{x}_{a,\\mathrm{ref}}-\\mathbf{x}_{a},\\qquad\\dot{\\mathbf{e}}_{a}=\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}_{a,\\mathrm{ref}}-\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}_{a}\n(3)\n𝐌\na\n​\n𝐞\n¨\na\n+\n𝐃\na\n​\n𝐞\n˙\na\n+\n𝐊\na\n​\n𝐞\na\n=\n𝟎\n\\mathbf{M}_{a}\\ddot{\\mathbf{e}}_{a}+\\mathbf{D}_{a}\\dot{\\mathbf{e}}_{a}+\\mathbf{K}_{a}\\mathbf{e}_{a}=\\mathbf{0}\n(4)\n𝐅\na\nvirt\n=\n𝐊\na\n​\n𝐞\na\n+\n𝐃\na\n​\n𝐞\n˙\na\n\\mathbf{F}_{a}^{\\mathrm{virt}}=\\mathbf{K}_{a}\\mathbf{e}_{a}+\\mathbf{D}_{a}\\dot{\\mathbf{e}}_{a}\ncaptures the interaction response, acting as a quantitative proxy for physical contact forces. If no disturbance exists, both pose error and the corresponding virtual forces converge to zero.\n3.2.2.\nGripper Configuration\nEach hand uses a single-DoF gripper. The controller receives a discrete action:\nγ\na\n∈\n{\nopen\n,\nclose\n}\n\\gamma_{a}\\in\\{\\text{open},\\text{close}\\}\n, where each action corresponds to a predefined joint angle target retrieved from the database. Gripper angles are retrieved from the VLM–RAG database based on the inferred task and object type, complementing the impedance parameters selected for the scenario.\n4.\nSystem Evaluation\nExperiments were conducted on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot equipped with two 1-DoF grippers and an Intel RealSense RGB-D camera mounted in the head for ego-centric perception. The task-space impedance controller ran on the on-board PC at 50 Hz, while the VLM–RAG pipeline was executed on an external workstation with an RTX 4090 GPU and Intel i9-13900K CPU to ensure real-time inference.\nFigure 2\n.\nImages from successful trials of the representative manipulation scenarios.\nA collage of six separate images illustrating the manipulation tasks used in the experiments.

Image 6: A top-down table view from the robot’s head camera showing the right hand holding a fork and poking a tomato.\n4.1.\nExperimental Setup\nEvaluation focused on tabletop tasks dominated by normal-direction interaction along the\nz\nz\n-axis. Five representative task groups were considered: (1) Following an irregular surface by maintaining smooth right-hand contact, (2) Applying controlled\nz\nz\n-direction forces while holding a massage ball, (3) Bimanual placement of two objects: a sauce bottle (left) and an egg (right), (4) Tool interaction using a fork to poke a fruit or vegetable, and (5) Grasping and lifting various tabletop objects.\nEach scenario was executed with multiple impedance and gripper settings to empirically determine the optimal parameters stored in the database. Fig.\n2\nshows examples from successful trials.\n4.1.1.\nVLM–RAG Retrieval Evaluation\nThe evaluation tests the discrete retrieval correctness of impedance and gripper parameters from a single ego-centric image.\nA retrieval is considered correct for evaluation purposes when the system: (1) classifies the task correctly via sequential visual yes/no queries, (2) retrieves the correct impedance entry based on the VLM output, and (3) retrieves the correct gripper configuration conditioned on both the VLM task label and the impedance scenario.\n4.1.2.\nRetrieval Process\nTo assess semantic generalization across tasks, 14 ego-centric test images were collected. These depict the nine task types but vary in camera viewpoint, object placement, and arm pose, ensuring robustness evaluation rather than memorization. For each image, the VLM infers the task through hierarchical visual queries. The resulting task label is used as a FAISS query to retrieve the impedance scenario. The scenario description is then concatenated with the VLM label to form a second query for retrieving the appropriate gripper configuration. This two-stage retrieval disambiguates visually similar tasks differing in object type or interaction mode.\n4.1.3.\nImpedance Control Evaluation\nTo confirm that retrieved parameters yield stable and bounded interaction behavior, we analyze\nz\nz\n-axis tracking errors and virtual force magnitudes during execution. Single-object tasks use the right arm; dual-object placement uses both arms. The evaluation checks whether the selected\nK\nz\nK_{z}\nand\nD\nz\nD_{z}\nvalues achieve the expected compliance and whether position errors and virtual forces remain bounded and task-appropriate.\n4.2.\nResults\n4.2.1.\nVLM–RAG System\nThe VLM–RAG pipeline was evaluated on 14 ego-centric test images representing variations of the nine tasks stored in the database (Sec.\n4.1.1\n). The system retrieved the correct impedance and gripper parameters in 13 out of 14 cases, resulting in an accuracy of 93% as can be seen in Fig.\n3\n. The single failure occurred when the primary object was partially occluded, highlighting a limitation of the current vision-based task inference.\nFigure 3\n.\nRetrieval accuracy of the VLM–RAG system across 14 scenarios.\nA bar chart with two vertical bars. The left bar, labeled “Correct,” has height 13. The right bar, labeled “Incorrect,” has height 1. The horizontal axis contains the two categories, and the vertical axis shows the number of retrievals.\n4.2.2.\nControl Evaluation Results\nTable\n1\nsummarizes the retrieved parameters and corresponding performance metrics. For each scenario, we report the selected normal-direction gains\nK\nz\n,\nD\nz\nK_{z},D_{z}\n, the mean and maximum absolute position error in\nz\nz\n, and the maximum virtual normal force magnitude. Across all scenarios,\nz\nz\n-axis tracking errors remained small, and the computed virtual force magnitudes scaled consistently with the selected impedance gains. This confirms that the retrieved parameters produce stable and task-appropriate interaction behavior.\nTable 1\n.\nTask-space impedance evaluation for representative tabletop tasks.\nTask\nK\nz\nK_{z}\nD\nz\nD_{z}\n|\ne\nz\n|\n¯\n\\overline{|e_{z}|}\nmax\n⁡\n|\ne\nz\n|\n\\max|e_{z}|\nmax\n⁡\n|\nF\nz\nvirt\n|\n\\max|F^{\\mathrm{virt}}_{z}|\n[N/m]\n[Ns/m]\n[m]\n[m]\n[arb.]\nFollow surface (R)\n3.0\n2.0\n0.016\n0.024\n0.103\napply pressure (R)\n5.0\n3.0\n0.017\n0.035\n0.334\nDual placement (R)\n2.0\n1.0\n0.013\n0.034\n0.089\nDual placement (L)\n6.0\n1.5\n0.009\n0.013\n0.176\nTool interaction (R)\n2.0\n1.5\n0.006\n0.016\n0.183\nGrasp from table (R)\n4.0\n1.5\n0.013\n0.022\n0.153\nA table listing six tasks (surface following, massage, dual placement for egg and bottle, tool poking, and grasping). For each, the table reports the arm used, stiffness K_z, damping D_z, mean and maximum absolute position error in z, and maximum virtual force magnitude.\nSurface following\nSoft stiffness enabled compliant tracking of curved geometry, with low virtual forces and small errors. As seen in Fig.\n4\n, the robot tracks the curved object with compliant contact. Fig.\n4\nshows that\nz\nz\nerror follow the surface profile, while\nx\nx\ndeviations stem from orientation adjustments of the arm.\nMassage and pressure application:\nHigher stiffness and damping resulted in larger virtual forces while maintaining similar tracking accuracy, demonstrating effective modulation of contact intensity.\nDual-object placement:\nAsymmetric stiffness values reflected object fragility. The egg-handling arm used soft settings, while the bottle-handling arm used stiffer gains, producing correspondingly higher force responses.\nTool interaction:\nModerate stiffness and damping supported controlled poking motions with low tracking error and transient force peaks appropriate for brief contact events.\nGrasp-and-lift:\nIntermediate stiffness ensured stable lifting without excessive pressure, with tracking errors remaining below 2.5 cm.\nThe controller behaved consistently, with low stiffness enabling compliant contact, high stiffness supporting forceful interaction, and asymmetric bimanual settings matching object-specific needs. The clear link between impedance parameters and virtual force responses indicates that these virtual forces may serve as effective proxies for real contact forces.\nFigure 4\n.\nTranslational errors in the surface-following task, showing desired and measured end-effector positions using forward kinematics.\nA set of three line plots showing end-effector position tracking over time for the surface-following task.

By combining VLM-based task inference with a FAISS-based RAG module, the system autonomously selects stiffness, damping, and grasp configurations directly from an ego-centric image using two small human-validated databases containing nine manipulation tasks and nine object-specific grasp entries. Experiments across manipulation tasks showed that the framework retrieves correct parameters in 93% of the evaluated scenarios and enables stable, compliant execution in real-world trials.\nGiven the limited evaluation scale and task diversity, the current results should be interpreted as a proof of feasibility rather than a comprehensive robustness assessment. In future work, we aim to incorporate task-dependent\nrotational\nimpedance to enable orientation-sensitive behaviors. Second, substituting the discrete database with a learned continuous mapping could allow interpolation across unseen tasks and object types. Finally, integrating force or visuotactile feedback would allow closed-loop impedance adaptation, improving safety and robustness.\nAcknowledgements\nResearch reported in this publication was financially supported by the RSF grant No. 24-41-02039.\nReferences\n(1)\nmol (2025)\n2025.\nMolmo-7B-O BnB 4bit quantized 7GB\n.\nhttps://huggingface.co/cyan2k/molmo-7B-O-bnb-4bit\nsen (2025)\n2025.\nSentence Transformer: all-MiniLM-L6-v2\n.\nhttps://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\nAbu-Dakka and Saveriano (2020)\nFares J.

    "preview_text": "Humanoid robots must adapt their contact behavior to diverse objects and tasks, yet most controllers rely on fixed, hand-tuned impedance gains and gripper settings. This paper introduces HumanoidVLM, a vision-language driven retrieval framework that enables the Unitree G1 humanoid to select task-appropriate Cartesian impedance parameters and gripper configurations directly from an egocentric RGB image. The system couples a vision-language model for semantic task inference with a FAISS-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that retrieves experimentally validated stiffness-damping pairs and object-specific grasp angles from two custom databases, and executes them through a task-space impedance controller for compliant manipulation. We evaluate HumanoidVLM on 14 visual scenarios and achieve a retrieval accuracy of 93%. Real-world experiments show stable interaction dynamics, with z-axis tracking errors typically within 1-3.5 cm and virtual forces consistent with task-dependent impedance settings. These results demonstrate the feasibility of linking semantic perception with retrieval-based control as an interpretable path toward adaptive humanoid manipulation.\n\nFigure 1\n.\nOverall architecture of the proposed HumanoidVLM framework.\nA schematic diagram showing the full HumanoidVLM pipeline.
