Recent works, such as NavCoT and NavGPT-2, demonstrate the potential of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for improving interpretability and long-horizon planning. Moreover, multimodal extensions like OctoNav-R1 and CoT-VLA further validate CoT as a promising pathway toward human-like navigation reasoning. However, existing approaches face critical drawbacks: purely textual CoTs lack spatial grounding and easily overfit to sparse annotated reasoning steps, while multimodal CoTs incur severe token inflation by generating imagined visual observations, making real-time navigation impractical. In this work, we propose\nFantasyVLN\n, a unified implicit reasoning framework that preserves the benefits of CoT reasoning without explicit token overhead. Specifically, imagined visual tokens are encoded into a compact latent space using a pretrained Visual AutoRegressor (VAR) during CoT reasoning training, and the model jointly learns from textual, visual, and multimodal CoT modes under a unified multi-CoT strategy. At inference, our model performs direct instruction-to-action mapping while still enjoying reasoning-aware representations. Extensive experiments on LH-VLN show that our approach achieves reasoning-aware yet real-time navigation, improving success rates and efficiency while reducing inference latency by an order of magnitude compared to explicit CoT methods.

Solving this task requires the joint understanding of semantics from language and spatial geometry from visual observations, along with long-horizon reasoning to plan a sequence of actions. In particular, for multi-stage and long-horizon navigation scenarios as proposed in\n(Song\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\n, the ability to perform robust multimodal reasoning, i.e., to integrate linguistic intent with visual-spatial context over extended temporal dependencies, is especially critical. Despite the progress made by recent multimodal large models, achieving effective cross-modal reasoning in VLN remains challenging due to the semantic–spatial gap and the need for interpretable yet sample-efficient reasoning mechanisms.\nThe recent success of large language models (LLMs) has inspired the integration of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into embodied navigation to improve interpretability and long-horizon decision-making. Methods such as NavCoT\n(Lin\net al.\n,\n2025b\n)\nand NavGPT-2\n(Zhou\net al.\n,\n2024\n)\nemploy step-by-step textual reasoning to decompose navigation instructions or generate intermediate subgoals. However, their reasoning remains confined to the textual modality, typically by translating observations into captions, thereby limiting the joint modeling of semantic planning and spatial understanding, both essential for successful navigation. This limitation is compounded by the difficulty of annotating CoT supervision in VLN, as highlighted by EvolveNav\n(Lin\net al.\n,\n2025a\n)\n, where multiple valid action sequences often exist. Moreover, explicitly supervised CoT reasoning tends to overfit training distributions and generalize poorly to unseen environments.\nLately, works such as CoT-VLA\n(Zhao\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\n, VISTA\n(Huang\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\n, RBF++\n(Chen\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\n, OctoNav-R1\n(Gao\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\n, and OmniNav\n(Xue\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\nhave extended CoT reasoning into visual or multimodal domains to better couple semantic and spatial reasoning for generalizability. While this multimodal CoT paradigm marks an important step forward, it also introduces new challenges for long-horizon navigation. In particular, modeling reasoning chains across both language and vision requires the model to iteratively generate and interpret imagined intermediate observations at each step, leading to severe token inflation.\nA typical reasoning step spanning 5–7 actions expands into over 3k–5k tokens, an order of magnitude larger than purely textual CoTs (usually\n<\n<\n500 tokens).\nThis explosion in sequence length drastically increases both training and inference latency, rendering real-time navigation infeasible even on high-end GPUs.\nTo address these challenges, we propose a unified implicit reasoning framework that retains the benefits of CoT-style reasoning while eliminating its explicit token overhead during inference. The key idea is twofold: (i) During training, we encode the imagined observation tokens generated by multimodal CoT reasoning into a compact latent space using a pretrained Visual AutoRegressive (VAR) model. This significantly reduces sequence length and training cost without compromising the richness of visual reasoning. (ii) At inference, the agent performs direct instruction-to-action mapping while still leveraging reasoning-aware representations, inspired by the\ntrain-with-CoT, infer-without-CoT\nparadigm of Aux-Think\n(Wang\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\n.\nConcretely, we introduce a unified multi-CoT training strategy that jointly learns from textual-only, visual-only, and textual–visual CoT modes using a special tag token to indicate each mode. This design unifies both the input format and model parameters within a single framework. During training, we align the action predictions from CoT-based reasoning modes with those from direct prediction (without CoT), enforcing modality-invariant reasoning representations. Consequently, the model learns implicit reasoning capabilities that generalize effectively without explicit CoT supervision or overfitting to training distributions.\nTo this end, our contributions are summarized as follows: (i) We propose the first unified implicit CoT reasoning framework that integrates textual, visual, and multimodal CoT paradigms within a single model. Unlike prior explicit CoT methods, our approach trains with diverse reasoning modes but performs inference without generating CoT sequences, achieving reasoning-aware yet real-time navigation. (ii) We introduce a gating-based multi-CoT learning mechanism that allows seamless switching among reasoning modes and direct action prediction under shared parameters. By aligning CoT-driven and direct action predictions, our model learns consistent, modality-invariant reasoning representations. (iii) To reduce the token explosion in multimodal reasoning, we compress imagined observation tokens into a compact latent space using a pretrained Visual AutoRegressor (VAR), improving training efficiency while preserving semantic–spatial reasoning capacity. (iv) Extensive experiments on the challenging LH-VLN benchmark demonstrate that our method substantially improves navigation success and efficiency in multi-stage and long-horizon scenarios, while reducing inference latency by an order of magnitude compared to explicit CoT approaches.\nFigure 2:\nOverview of our unified multimodal Chain-of-Thought reasoning framework. The model supports four reasoning modes under a shared architecture: (a) non-CoT reasoning for real-time inference, (b) textual CoT, (c) visual CoT enabled by VAR-compressed imagined observations, and (d) multimodal CoT combining textual and visual reasoning. A gating mechanism switches the model across reasoning modes, while the action predictions from CoT modes are consistently aligned with the non-CoT mode.\n2\nRelated Works\n2.1\nVision-and-Language Navigation\nEarly VLN models typically separate perception, instruction understanding, and action planning into discrete modules, and rely on imitation\n(Nguyen\net al.\n,\n2019\n; Wang\net al.\n,\n2022\n; Wu\net al.\n,\n2020\n)\nor reinforcement learning\n(Xu\net al.\n,\n2023\n; Wang\net al.\n,\n2020\n)\nwith auxiliary tasks such as progress monitoring or instruction reweighting.\nHowever, these methods, built on panoramic observations in discrete environments (e.g., R2R\n(Anderson\net al.\n,\n2018\n)\nand RxR\n(Ku\net al.\n,\n2020\n)\n), suffer from poor semantic alignment and limited generalization in continuous or unseen environments (e.g. VLN-CE\n(Krantz\net al.\n,\n2020\n)\n).\nTo address these limitations, recent studies have shifted toward end-to-end navigation policy learning with pretrained vision-language models.\nFor example, Poliformer\n(Zeng\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\nintroduces transformer-based on-policy reinforcement learning for video-level navigation.\nNaVid\n(Zhang\net al.\n,\n2024a\n)\nand Uni-NaVid\n(Zhang\net al.\n,\n2025a\n)\nextend this paradigm by performing monocular video-based navigation without depth or maps and unifying multiple embodied tasks.\nNaVILA\n(Cheng\net al.\n,\n2024\n)\nfurther integrates VLN with legged robot locomotion, achieving impressive cross-embodiment generalization.\nWhile achieving remarkable progress on short-term tasks, they still struggle to reason and plan for long-horizon, multi-stage tasks.\nMore recently, CoT reasoning has emerged as a crucial paradigm for Embodied AI tasks.\nIn VLN, NavGPT leverages the zero-shot CoT reasoning ability of GPT-4, while Aux-Think introduces auxiliary CoT supervision to internalize reasoning patterns during training.\nYet, existing CoT-based VLN methods confine reasoning within a single modality, leaving multimodal CoT largely unexplored.\nIn this paper, we follow the continuous environment setting and systematically investigate multimodal CoT reasoning in VLN.\n2.2\nChain-of-Thought Reasoning\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enables large language models (LLMs) to solve complex problems by explicitly generating intermediate steps\n(Wei\net al.\n,\n2022\n)\n.\nSubsequent variants, such as Self-Consistency\n(Wang\net al.\n,\n2023\n)\nand Least-to-Most Prompting\n(Zhou\net al.\n,\n2023\n)\n, further enhance reasoning robustness and compositionality.\nRecent studies have extended CoT to vision-language models\n(Zhang\net al.\n,\n2024b\n)\n, which can be categorized into three types based on the modality of reasoning steps: Textual CoT, Visual CoT, and Multimodal CoT.\nSpecifically, Textual CoT\n(Zhang\net al.\n,\n2024c\n)\nin VLMs typically follows the format of vanilla LLM CoT.\nVisual CoT methods, such as CoT-VLA\n(Zhao\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\nand DreamVLA\n(Zhang\net al.\n,\n2025b\n)\n, generate future frames before action prediction in manipulation tasks, while Multimodal CoT\n(Cheng\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\njointly predicts paired textual and visual reasoning steps in multimodal tasks.\nTo the best of our knowledge,\nFantasyVLN\nis the first unified CoT reasoning framework that integrates these three reasoning paradigms.\n3\nMethods\n3.1\nOverview\nWe propose\nFantasyVLN\n, a VLN framework that integrates multimodal reasoning modes as its core design, while enabling implicit reasoning for efficient inference. As shown in Figure\n2\n,\nFantasyVLN\ninternalizes diverse CoT reasoning patterns across modalities through end-to-end joint training, and enhances the non-CoT reasoning mode via a cross-mode alignment constraint.\nThis enables combining the advantages of both textual and visual CoT reasoning without incurring explicit CoT reasoning time.\nMoreover, we perform visual CoT reasoning in the latent space of the VAR model\n(Tian\net al.\n,\n2024\n)\n, which improves training and inference efficiency compared with pixel-space methods.\nBelow, we introduce the problem setup, cross-mode alignment constraint, unified multimodal implicit reasoning and latent visual CoT learning.\n3.2\nProblem Setup\nVLN aims to develop an embodied agent\nπ\nθ\n\\pi_{\\theta}\nthat navigates continuous 3D environments\n𝒪\n\\mathcal{O}\nbased on a natural language instruction\nℐ\n\\mathcal{I}\nand visual observations, which can be formulated as a non-Markovian temporal decision problem.\nLet\ns\n0\ns_{0}\ndenote the initial state, i.e., location and orientation, and\n𝒰\n\\mathcal{U}\ndenote the action space.\nAt each timestep\nt\nt\n, the agent\nπ\nθ\n\\pi_{\\theta}\nreceives multi-view visual observations\no\nt\n∈\n𝒪\no_{t}\\in\\mathcal{O}\nand predicts future actions\n𝒜\nt\n∈\n𝒰\n\\mathcal{A}_{t}\\in\\mathcal{U}\nconditioned on the instruction\nℐ\n\\mathcal{I}\nand historical observations\n{\no\n≤\nt\n}\n\\{o_{\\leq t}\\}\n.\nSubsequently, the predicted actions\n𝒜\nt\n\\mathcal{A}_{t}\nare executed, transferring the agent\nπ\nθ\n\\pi_{\\theta}\nto a new state according to the environment dynamics.\nThis interaction process continues until a stop action is executed or the maximum step\nT\nT\nis reached.\n3.3\nCompact Visual Chain-of-Thought\nConventional V-CoT reasoning predicts thousands of visual tokens at each reasoning step, resulting in low training efficiency and high inference latency.\nTo address this issue, we present\nCompact Visual Chain-of-Thought\n(CompV-CoT), which trains\nQwen2.5-VL\nto directly generate a compact set of visual tokens in the latent space of a pretrained VAR model, yielding a novel compressed visual chain-of-thought representation with far fewer tokens.\nThe VAR model follows a next-scale prediction paradigm to hierarchically encode visual information, achieving higher efficiency than conventional autoencoding approaches such as VAE, VQ-VAE\n(Gafni\net al.\n,\n2022\n)\nor RAE\n(Zheng\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\n.\nGiven a\n256\n×\n256\n256\\times 256\nimage, the VAR model enables precise reconstruction using the corresponding low-scale representations, which contain only\n30\n30\nvisual tokens.\nAs shown in Table\n1\n, VAR achieves a higher compression ratio under comparable reconstruction quality.\nTable 1:\nComparison of compression ratio and reconstruction error (MSE) across different visual compressors.\nCompressors\nComp. Ratio\nMSE\nRAE-DINOv2-B\n1/256\n0.012\nRAE-SigLIP2-B\n1/256\n0.011\nVAE\n1/64\n0.005\nVQVAE\n1/64\n0.007\nVAR\n1/2185\n0.039\nSpecifically, we employ the VAR model as the visual decoder of the VLM and perform V-CoT in the VAR latent space.\nThe VLM first takes navigation instructions and visual observations as input and then generates latent representations of future observations before predicting actions.\nThe VAR model finally decodes generated representations into pixel frames.\nWe freeze the VAR model during training, while the VLM first learns to predict latent future observations and then infers the corresponding actions.\nDuring inference, we use only the VLM to perform visual CoT-based navigation without explicit VAR decoding.\nOwing to the highly efficient visual information compression and non-display image decoding, the proposed CompV-CoT method improves both training and inference efficiency.\n3.4\nUnified Multimodal Chain-of-Thought\nBuilding on CompV-CoT, we further present a\nUnified Multimodal Chain-of-Thought\n(UM-CoT) framework that integrates textual, compressed visual, and multimodal reasoning within a single agent.\nTextual CoT in VLN.\nTextual CoT (T-CoT) models the agent’s reasoning as an explicit semantic planning process that bridges language understanding and action decision.\nInstead of directly mapping instructions to actions, the agent first generates textual intermediate reasoning steps\n𝒯\n^\nt\n\\widehat{\\mathcal{T}}_{t}\n.\nThese reasoning steps then provide structured causal guidance for predicting subsequent actions\n𝒜\n^\nt\n\\widehat{\\mathcal{A}}_{t}\n, enabling interpretable and more reliable decision-making.\nSpecifically, the intermediate steps typically involve inferring subgoals from the instruction, assessing progress through current and historical visual observations, and identifying actionable cues for achieving the next objective.\nCompV-CoT as Visual CoT.\nFor visual CoT (V-CoT), we directly adopt the CompV-CoT introduced in Sec.\n3.3\nas the visual reasoning mode in UM-CoT.\nIn this setting, the agent imagines future observations in the VAR latent space by predicting compressed visual tokens, and then infers actions conditioned on the imagined latent trajectory.\nCompared with pixel-space prediction, this CompV-CoT design yields more efficient and stable visual reasoning.\nMultimodal CoT in VLN.\nMultimodal CoT (MM-CoT) is defined as a native combination of T-CoT and CompV-CoT, where the agent is required to generate paired textual–visual reasoning steps.\nWe denote the multimodal reasoning trace as\nℳ\nt\n=\n[\n𝒯\nt\n,\n𝒱\nt\n]\n\\mathcal{M}_{t}=[\\mathcal{T}_{t},\\mathcal{V}_{t}]\n, which jointly encodes semantic plans and imagined future observations, and use it to guide subsequent action prediction.\nUnified Multimodal CoT Reasoning Framework.\nTo unify the above reasoning modes within a single framework, we introduce two binary gating signals\ng\n𝒯\ng_{\\mathcal{T}}\nand\ng\n𝒱\ng_{\\mathcal{V}}\nthat control whether textual and visual reasoning is activated.\nGiven\nℐ\n\\mathcal{I}\n,\n{\no\n≤\nt\n}\n\\{o_{\\leq t}\\}\n,

al.\n,\n2025\n)\nand adopt the non-CoT reasoning mode during inference.\nSimilar to Aux-Think\n(Wang\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\n, our framework serves as an implicit reasoning mechanism that internalizes diverse CoT patterns and implicitly enhances non-CoT reasoning through cross-mode alignment and joint training across reasoning modes.\nTable 2:\nComparison of navigation accuracy across different VLN

They can be divided into four categories:\n(i) textual CoT-based methods, Aux-Think\n(Wang\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\n;\n(ii) visual CoT-based methods, CoT-VLA and WorldVLA;\n(iii) memory-based methods, MGDM;\n(iv) other baselines provided by LH-VLN, GLM-4v prompt, NaviLLM and GPT-4 + NaviLLM.\nFor fair comparison, all methods are trained on the same LH-VLN training set, and the validation set is used to select the best checkpoint for each method.\nFor Aux-Think and CoT-VLA, we implement their methods based on the descriptions in their papers, as the training codes are not publicly available.\nFor WorldVLA, we adapt the official implementation by modifying the preprocessing pipeline to support training on the LH-VLN dataset.\nFor all other methods, we use the implementations provided by LH-VLN.\nMetrics.\nFollowing\n(Song\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\n, we use Success Rate (SR), Independent Success Rate (ISR), Conditional Success Rate (CSR), and CSR weighted by Ground Truth (CGT) to measure multi-stage navigation accuracy.\nSR denotes the success rate of multi-stage task navigation, ISR represents the success rate of individual subtasks, CSR weights the ISR according to the success of preceding subtasks, and CGT further weights the CSR based on the length of the expert trajectory.\nMoreover, we introduce the Action Per Second (APS) to evaluate inference efficiency:\nAPS\n=\nN\nact\nT\nnav\n,\n\\text{APS}=\\frac{N_{\\text{act}}}{T_{\\text{nav}}},\n(10)\nwhere\nN\nact\nN_{\\text{act}}\ndenotes the total number of executed actions, and\nT\nnav\nT_{\\text{nav}}\nrepresents the total navigation time in seconds.\nTable 4:\nComparison of inference efficiency across different CoT reasoning methods.

To understand the underlying cause, we compare their training efficiency with our unified multimodal formulation.\nAs shown in Figure\n5\n, WorldVLA exhibits slow and unstable convergence, requiring over\n10\n10\nk iterations to reach moderate token prediction accuracy. This indicates that pixel-level V-CoT learning delivers weak gradient signals, as the model must reconstruct high-dimensional visual tokens for each reasoning step. In contrast,\nFantasyVLN\nconverges rapidly within a few thousand iterations, reflecting stable supervision and more efficient learning dynamics. This improvement stems from our CompV-CoT design, where visual reasoning operates in a compact latent space encoded by the pretrained VAR compressor. By replacing dense pixel reconstruction with compressed latent prediction, the model learns richer multimodal reasoning cues under a substantially lighter optimization burden.\nOverall, these results highlight that CompV-CoT not only enhances reasoning efficiency but also yields more stable and interpretable learning behavior, contributing to the superior navigation accuracy of\nFantasyVLN\nin long-horizon tasks.\nFigure 5:\nComparison of training efficiency between\nFantasyVLN\nand WorldVLA.\nExplicit vs. Implicit Reasoning.\nFantasyVLN\nsupports both explicit and implicit reasoning, enabling us to systematically compare their effectiveness across different CoT modalities. As summarized in Table\n6\n, we evaluate the T-CoT, V-CoT, and MM-CoT models under two inference modes. For each case, the model is jointly trained with its corresponding CoT mode and the direct prediction pathway. During inference, using the CoT branch corresponds to explicit reasoning, while employing the direct pathway corresponds to implicit reasoning.\nOverall, implicit reasoning consistently yields higher navigation accuracy, particularly under multimodal settings. In MM-CoT, implicit inference achieves the best performance with\n2.44\n2.44\nSR and\n11.01\n11.01\nISR, surpassing the explicit counterpart by a large margin. This result aligns with the observations in Aux-Think\n(Wang\net al.\n,\n2025\n)\n, suggesting that explicit CoT decoding may amplify cumulative reasoning errors across long trajectories. We attribute this phenomenon to two key factors: (i) the limited training data of LH-VLN (only\n18\n18\nk trajectory slices of five steps each) makes explicit CoT sequences prone to overfitting and error propagation; (ii) explicit reasoning expands temporal dependencies, causing misaligned textual or visual CoT tokens to accumulate deviations over time. In contrast, implicit reasoning benefits from cross-mode alignment during training, allowing the model to internalize reasoning cues while maintaining stable and efficient inference.\nTable 6:\nComparison of explicit and implicit CoT reasoning across modalities.\nMetrics\nMode\nT-CoT\nV-CoT\nMM-CoT\nSR\nexplicit\n0.98\n0.49\n0.98\nimplicit\n0.49\n1.46\n2.44\nISR\nexplicit\n8.26\n7.34\n8.62\nimplicit\n6.06\n11.19\n11.01\n5\nConclusion\nWe introduced\nFantasyVLN\n, a unified implicit reasoning framework that preserves the benefits of Chain-of-Thought supervision while avoiding the token explosion inherent to explicit textual or multimodal CoTs. By compressing imagined visual observations into a compact latent space via a pretrained VAR model and jointly training across textual, visual, and multimodal CoT modes under a unified multi-CoT strategy, the framework learns modality-invariant reasoning representations without requiring explicit CoT generation at inference. As a result, the agent performs direct instruction-to-action mapping while retaining reasoning-aware behavior. Experiments on the challenging LH-VLN benchmark show that this formulation substantially improves navigation accuracy and efficiency, while reducing inference latency by an order of magnitude compared to explicit CoT baselines. These findings demonstrate that implicit multimodal reasoning provides a practical pathway toward real-time embodied navigation, and highlight the potential of compact latent reasoning signals for closing the gap between semantic intent and spatial decision-making in complex environments.\nReferences\nP.

You will get a task with historical and current pictures you see. Based on this information, you need to decide your next 5 actions, which could involve\n<|left|>\n,\n<|right|>\n,\n<|forward|>\n. If you finish your mission, output\n<|stop|>\n. Your current observations are left side:\n<image>\n, front side:\n<image>\n, right side:\n<image>\n. Your historical pictures are:\n<image>\n…\n<image>\n. Your mission is: [instruction].\nIn multi-stage navigation tasks, the agent must stop upon completing each subtask and maintain awareness of how many subtasks have been finished. To this end, we further extend the prompt with the following description:\nPS: The mission is complex. You may infer several subtasks within the mission, and output\n<|stop|>\nwhen a sub-task is achieved. So far, you have output\n<|stop|>\n0 times. Historical information reflects progress up to the current subgoal.\nA.3\nT-CoT Data Annotation\nWe employ\nQwen-VL-Max\nto generate T-CoT annotations for each navigation slice (see Eq. (\n11\n)). All 18,554 navigation slices from the LH-VLN training set are annotated. The annotation prompt is as follows:\nYou are a professional AI data annotator. Your task is to label the intermediate CoT reasoning for VLN trajectory slices. Input includes: user instruction,\n≤\n\\leq\n20 historical images (front view), 3 current images (left, front, and right view), and the GT action sequence.\nAnnotation steps:\n1.\nSemantic Planning\n: Break the mission into precise sub-tasks with clear spatial goals (e.g., “reach the cabinet table in the living room,” “exit the living room,” “enter the office,” “approach the office table”). Sub-tasks should reflect stepwise navigation milestones rather than abstract summaries.\n2.\nVisual Description\n: Based on the semantic plan, describe what the historical and current images reveal about completed and upcoming sub-tasks. Be concise, factual, and avoid vague wording.\n3.\nAction Decision-Making\n: Predict the next action sequence (5 steps) aligned with the semantic plan and supported by the visual description. Provide a brief justification for the predicted steps. Use natural, instruction-like phrasing instead of raw action codes.\n4.\nVisual Imagination\n: Describe the expected scene after executing the predicted actions, focusing on landmarks or key objects that should become visible or reachable.\n# Output format:\n<think>\nSemantic Plan:\n⋯\n\\cdots\nVisual Description:\n⋯\n\\cdots\nAction Planning:\n⋯\n\\cdots\nVisual Imagination:\n⋯\n\\cdots\n</think>\nNote: Replace “\n⋯\n\\cdots\n” with actual CoT content. Do not output quotes or ellipses.\n# User Instruction: [Instruction]\n# GT Action:\n<|forward|>\n⋯\n\\cdots\n<|right|>\nA.4\nData Augmentation\nTo improve the robustness of the instruction-following model under diverse visual histories, we augment each training example by perturbing only the historical image sequence while keeping the final three observation images unchanged. Given an original sample with N historical frames\n{\nh\n1\n,\n…\n,\nh\nN\n}\n\\{h_{1},\\dots,h_{N}\\}\nand the last three observation frames\n{\no\nℓ\n,\no\nf\n,\no\nr\n}\n\\{o_{\\ell},o_{f},o_{r}\\}\n, we generate up to two additional augmented variants per sample. The augmentation operations are stochastic and applied with independent Bernoulli trials.\nUniform Subsampling.\nFor trajectories with at least ten historical images, we apply uniform subsampling with probability 0.5. Specifically, we replace the original history\n{\nh\ni\n}\ni\n=\n1\nN\n\\{h_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{N}\nwith a stride-2 subsequence\n{\nh\n1\n,\nh\n3\n,\nh\n5\n,\n…\n}\n\\{h_{1},h_{3},h_{5},\\dots\\}\nwhile preserving the three observation images. This operation reduces temporal redundancy and encourages the model to rely on coarser but more informative state transitions.\nStochastic History Trimming.\nFor trajectories with at least seven historical frames, we further apply stochastic trimming. Two perturbations may occur:\n(i) with probability 0.5, we remove the first two historical frames, yielding\n{\nh\n3\n,\nh\n4\n,\n…\n,\nh\nN\n}\n\\{h_{3},h_{4},\\dots,h_{N}\\}\n;\n(ii) with probability 0.5, and only when the remaining length is at least seven, we randomly select an index\nk\nk\nand remove two consecutive frames\n{\nh\nk\n,\nh\nk\n+\n1\n}\n\\{h_{k},h_{k+1}\\}\n.\nAt least one of the above operations must be triggered for the augmented sample to be retained.\nThis procedure introduces temporal uncertainty, forcing the model to rely on stable, task-relevant cues rather than positional biases.\nAppendix B\nDetail Formulations.\nHere, we provide the formal formulation of the proposed\nFantasyVLN\n, which unifies Non-CoT, T-CoT, V-CoT, and MM-CoT reasoning modes within a single reasoning framework.

Training is conducted on 64 H20 GPUs, each equipped with 141 GB of memory. We use the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of\n1\n×\n10\n−\n4\n1\\times 10^{-4}\n, a weight decay of\n0.1\n0.1\n, and a cosine schedule with a\n5\n%\n5\\%\nwarmup ratio. The per-device batch size is set to 4, supported by 32 dataloader workers. We employ\nbfloat16\nprecision, enable gradient checkpointing, and adopt DeepSpeed ZeRO-2 for memory-efficient optimization.\nEvaluation.\nWe perform online evaluation for all methods. Given an initial position, the agent interacts with the simulator to execute multi-stage navigation tasks. At each step, the agent receives visual observations and predicts subsequent actions; the environment then applies the predicted action and updates the agent’s state. When the agent outputs\n<|stop|>\n, the environment verifies whether the current subtask is completed (i.e., the distance to the target location is within 1 m) and then proceeds to the next subtask. If the agent exhausts its action budget before completing the subtask, the subtask is marked as failed. This procedure continues until all subtasks are completed or terminated.\nSpecial Tokens.\nLeveraging the vocabulary extensibility of autoregressive models, we implement the required functionalities through systematic vocabulary expansion.\nSpecifically, we introduce (i) action tokens\n<|forward|>\n,\n<|left|>\n,\n<|right|>\n,\n<|stop|>\nfor navigation action prediction; (ii) VAR latent tokens\n<|1|>\n–\n<|4096|>\nfor CompV-CoT and MM-CoT latent-space visual reasoning; (iii) system tokens such as\n<|NAV|>\n,\n<think>\n,\n</think>\nto regulate narrative formatting; and (iv) gating tokens\n<textual_think>\n,\n<no_textual_think>\n,\n<visual_think>\n,\n<no_visual_think>\nthat serve as the binary signals\ng\n𝒯\ng_{\\mathcal{T}}\nand\ng\n𝒱\ng_{\\mathcal{V}}\nfor unified multimodal CoT control.",
    "preview_text": "Achieving human-level performance in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an embodied agent to jointly understand multimodal instructions and visual-spatial context while reasoning over long action sequences. Recent works, such as NavCoT and NavGPT-2, demonstrate the potential of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for improving interpretability and long-horizon planning. Moreover, multimodal extensions like OctoNav-R1 and CoT-VLA further validate CoT as a promising pathway toward human-like navigation reasoning. However, existing approaches face critical drawbacks: purely textual CoTs lack spatial grounding and easily overfit to sparse annotated reasoning steps, while multimodal CoTs incur severe token inflation by generating imagined visual observations, making real-time navigation impractical. In this work, we propose FantasyVLN, a unified implicit reasoning framework that preserves the benefits of CoT reasoning without explicit token overhead. Specifically, imagined visual tokens are encoded into a compact latent space using a pretrained Visual AutoRegressor (VAR) during CoT reasoning training, and the model jointly learns from textual, visual, and multimodal CoT modes under a unified multi-CoT strategy. At inference, our model performs direct instruction-to-action mapping while still enjoying reasoning-aware representations. Extensive experiments on LH-VLN show that our approach achieves reasoning-aware yet real-time navigation, improving success rates and efficiency while reducing inference latency by an order of magnitude compared to explicit CoT methods.\n\nFantasyVLN\n: Unified Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Vision-Language Navigation\nJing Zuo\n1,2\n*\n§\n\\S\n, Lingzhou Mu\n1,3\n*\n§\n\\S\n, Fan Jiang\n1\n*\n†\n\\dagger\n‡\n\\ddagger\n, Chengcheng Ma\n1\n,\nMu Xu\n1\n,\nYonggang Qi\n2\n‡\n\\ddagger\n1\nFantasy AIGC Team,\n2\nBeijing University of Posts and Telecommunications,\n3\nTsinghua University\njiangfan0576@gmail.com\nqiyg@bupt.edu.cn\nAbstract\nAchieving human-level performan",

            "answer": "## 论文评价指标与数据集分析\n\n### 一、 主要评价指标\n\n论文在LH-VLN基准上使用了以下四个核心指标来评估多阶段导航任务的性能，具体细节如下表所示：\n\n| 指标名称 | 英文全称 | 计算公式/定义 | 评估目的与细节 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **成功率 (SR)** | Success Rate | `SR = (成功完成的任务数) / (总任务数)` | **评估整体任务完成能力**。一个“任务”包含多个按顺序完成的子任务（例如：先去客厅，再去厨房）。只有**所有子任务**都成功完成，该任务才计为成功。这是最严格的指标。 |\n| **独立子任务成功率 (ISR)** | Independent Success Rate | `ISR = (成功的子任务数) / (总子任务数)` | **评估单个子任务的导航能力**，不考虑子任务之间的依赖关系。即使整个任务失败，其中成功完成的子任务也会被计入。反映了模型在局部路径规划上的稳健性。 |\n| **条件成功率 (CSR)** | Conditional Success Rate | `CSR = Σ (子任务权重 * 子任务成功与否) / 总子任务数`，其中权重取决于前序子任务是否成功。 | **评估在依赖链上的性能**。为每个子任务分配一个权重，该权重基于**之前所有子任务是否都成功**。如果前序子任务失败，当前子任务的权重会降低（甚至为0），这惩罚了错误累积，更能反映长视野规划的实际效果。 |\n| **基于专家轨迹加权的条件成功率 (CGT)** | CSR weighted by Ground Truth | 在CSR的基础上，进一步用**专家演示轨迹的长度**对每个子任务的贡献进行加权。 | **评估导航效率**。不仅考虑成功与否，还考虑路径质量。更接近专家（最优）轨迹长度的成功导航会获得更高权重，鼓励模型寻找更短、更高效的路径。 |\n\n**此外，论文还引入了一个效率指标：**\n*   **每秒动作数 (APS)**: `APS = N_act / T_nav`。其中 `N_act` 是执行的动作总数，`T_nav` 是总导航时间（秒）。该指标用于**量化推理效率**，对比显式CoT（生成大量中间令牌）和隐式CoT（直接预测动作）方法的实时性差异。\n\n### 二、 使用的数据集\n\n论文在 **LH-VLN** 数据集上进行训练和评估。\n\n| 数据集属性 | 细节描述 |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **数据集名称** | **LH-VLN** (Towards Long-Horizon Vision-Language Navigation) |\n| **核心特点** | 1. **多阶段任务**：每个导航指令包含多个需要按顺序到达的子目标。<br>2. **长视野轨迹**：导航路径长，对模型的长期推理和规划能力要求高。<br>3. **连续环境**：在逼真的、连续的3D仿真环境（如Habitat）中进行，而非离散的导航图。 |\n| **任务形式** | 智能体接收自然语言指令（如“先去客厅的沙发旁，然后进入厨房打开冰箱”）和多视角视觉观察，输出动作序列（前进、左转、右转、停止）。 |\n| **数据划分** | 采用**在线评估**，在**测试集**上进行。测试集中的**任务场景和指令都是训练时未见过的**，用于检验模型的泛化能力。 |\n| **训练数据细节** | 1. 从专家演示轨迹中切片，每个训练样本包含：指令、历史视觉观察序列、当前多视角观察、未来5个动作的序列。<br>2. 使用 **Qwen-VL-Max** 模型为每个切片自动生成**文本CoT（T-CoT）** 标注（共18,554个切片）。<br>3. 进行了数据增强，包括对历史图像序列的均匀下采样和随机修剪，以提高模型对视觉历史变化的鲁棒性。 |\n| **挑战性** | 由于任务复杂、轨迹长，微小的决策错误会随时间累积，导致最终失败。因此，该数据集能有效区分不同模型在复杂推理和长期规划上的能力。 |\n\n### 总结\n**FantasyVLN** 论文通过 **LH-VLN** 这一具有挑战性的多阶段长视野导航数据集，全面评估了其统一多模态推理框架的性能。评价指标不仅涵盖了导航成功率（SR, ISR），还通过**CSR和CGT**强调了任务依赖关系和路径效率，并通过**APS**突出了其方法在实现“推理感知的实时导航”方面的核心优势。",

            "question": "论文的主要局限性有哪些？未来可能的改进方向是什么？",
            "answer": "## 论文主要局限性分析\n\n基于对《FantasyVLN: Unified Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Vision-Language Navigation》的深入阅读，本文提出的方法虽然取得了显著进展，但仍存在一些固有的局限性。\n\n### **主要局限性**\n\n1.  **对预训练视觉自回归模型（VAR）的强依赖**\n    - **压缩瓶颈**：整个**紧凑视觉思维链（CompV-CoT）** 的核心依赖于VAR模型将高维视觉观察压缩到极低维的潜在空间（如30个token）。这带来了两个风险：\n        - **信息损失**：VAR本身的重构误差（MSE为0.039，高于其他压缩器）可能导致关键空间或语义细节的丢失，影响长程规划的准确性。\n        - **模型耦合**：FantasyVLN的性能上限受限于VAR的压缩与重建能力。VAR的改进或失败会直接传导至导航模型。\n\n2.  **训练数据的规模与质量限制**\n    - **数据稀缺**：论文指出LH-VLN基准的训练数据有限（仅18k个轨迹切片）。在**数据效率**方面，模型可能尚未得到充分验证。\n    - **标注噪声**：**文本思维链（T-CoT）** 的监督信号依赖于`Qwen-VL-Max`自动生成，而非人工精确标注。这引入了**标注噪声**和**一致性风险**，可能限制模型学习最优推理模式的能力。\n\n3.  **“训练用CoT，推理不用CoT”范式的固有矛盾**\n    - **表征对齐的不完全性**：虽然通过**跨模态对齐约束**强制不同推理模式输出一致的动作，但“隐式推理”在测试时完全摒弃了显式的中间步骤生成。这存在一个**假设**：训练时学到的“推理感知表征”能完全等价于运行时所需的推理能力。对于极其复杂或训练分布外的场景，这种**表征迁移的有效性**可能下降。\n\n4.  **评估场景的特定性**\n    - **基准单一**：所有实验均在**LH-VLN**（长视野、多阶段）基准上进行。虽然该基准具有挑战性，但模型在**更广泛VLN任务**（如R2R、VLN-CE等）上的泛化能力尚未得到验证。\n    - **成功率的绝对水平较低**：即使是最佳模型，其**任务成功率（SR）** 也仅为2.44%。这虽然超越了基线，但表明在**极端长程、多阶段导航**问题上，仍有巨大的性能提升空间，方法尚未完全解决该难题。\n\n5.  **实时性对模型能力的潜在制约**\n    - **效率与性能的权衡**：为了追求**实时推理（~1 APS）**，模型彻底放弃了显式CoT生成。这固然提升了效率，但也**永久失去了**在测试时利用显式、可解释的中间步骤进行**动态纠错**或**人类干预**的可能性。\n\n---\n\n## 未来可能的改进方向\n\n针对上述局限性，未来的研究可以从以下几个方向展开：\n\n### **1. 提升视觉表征的鲁棒性与效率**\n    - **开发更优的视觉压缩器**：研究兼具**高压缩比**、**低重构误差**和**强语义保持能力**的新型视觉表征模型，以替代或改进VAR。\n    - **探索非重建式表征**：研究不依赖于像素级重建的视觉表征学习（如基于对比学习或任务驱动的特征），直接学习对导航决策至关重要的**几何与语义特征**。\n\n### **2. 增强数据利用与训练策略**\n    - **大规模合成数据生成**：利用**仿真引擎**或**世界模型**自动生成海量、多样化的导航轨迹与对应的多模态CoT数据，以突破真实数据规模的瓶颈。\n    - **自监督与自改进机制**：引入**自训练**或**强化学习**框架，使模型能在与环境的交互中**自我生成高质量CoT数据**并迭代优化策略，如借鉴EvolveNav的思路。\n\n### **3. 优化隐式-显式推理协同机制**\n    - **动态可切换推理**：设计一个**自适应门控机制**，允许模型在运行时根据任务复杂度、置信度或计算资源，**动态选择**使用隐式推理（高效）或显式推理（高精度）模式。\n    - **轻量级显式推理**：探索在推理时生成**极度精简但关键**的中间标记（如几个关键路标或决策点），在可承受的开销内保留部分可解释性和纠错能力。\n\n### **4. 拓展任务与场景的泛化性**\n    - **跨基准与跨领域评估**：在更多样化的VLN数据集（包括室内、室外、连续、离散环境）上验证FantasyVLN框架的**泛化能力**。\n    - **集成更丰富的模态**：考虑融入**深度信息**、**音频**（如指令语音）或**物理常识**，构建更全面的世界模型，以应对更复杂的现实环境。\n\n### **5. 理论分析与模型可解释性深化**\n    - **解耦与归因分析**：通过消融实验和可视化技术，更深入地理解**文本CoT**、**视觉CoT**和**多模态CoT**分别对最终导航决策的贡献程度，以及它们如何在潜在空间中融合。\n    - **学习动力学研究**：分析**跨模态对齐约束**如何影响模型不同层的表征学习，从理论层面验证“隐式推理”机制的有效性边界。\n\n**总结**：FantasyVLN的创新性在于通过**统一的多模态隐式推理框架**，巧妙地平衡了推理能力与实时性需求。未来的工作应致力于**夯实其基础组件（如视觉编码）**、**突破数据限制**、**设计更灵活的推理机制**，并最终在**更广泛、更复杂的具身智能任务**中验证和拓展这一范式。",
