It’s an active process of hypothesis testing.”\n– Richard Gregory\nPretrained vision-language models (VLMs)\n[\nbeyer2024paligemma\n,\nwang2024qwen2\n,\nbai2025qwen2\n,\nkaramcheti2024prismatic\n]\nhave become a highly effective approach for building large-scale vision-language-action (VLA) architectures. Such models have demonstrated impressive generalization and robustness in robotic manipulation\n[\nkimopenvla\n,\nblack2410pi0\n,\nliu2025trivla\n,\nintelligence2025pi_\n,\nli2023vision\n,\nbrohan2023rt\n]\n. However, most current VLA approaches primarily process 2D visual inputs, requiring massive datasets to bridge the gap between perception and action. In contrast, 3D-aware robotic policies leverage structural cues from 3D data, achieving better sample efficiency and spatial reasoning for complex manipulation tasks\n[\nshridhar2023perceiver\n,\n3d-da\n,\ngervet2023act3d\n,\ngoyal2023rvt\n,\ngoyal2024rvt\n]\n.\nGregory’s insight captures a core challenge in embodied intelligence: perception must not remain a passive receiver of sensory input but instead become an active hypothesis-testing process—seeking, selecting, and verifying information relevant to the task at hand. However, existing VLA models\n[\nkimopenvla\n,\nliu2025trivla\n,\nzhen20243d\n,\nqu2025spatialvla\n]\nlargely rely on static or wrist-mounted cameras, constraining observations to a fixed, end-effector-centric viewpoint. Such a setup inherently limits perceptual flexibility: the agent cannot adaptively and dynamically adjust its viewpoint or camera resolution according to the task context. As a result, the absence of adaptive viewpoint selection during long-horizon or fine-grained manipulation prevents current systems from acquiring essential contextual information, thereby undermining the robustness and generalizability of learned policies\n[\nliu2025trivla\n,\nshridhar2023perceiver\n,\n3d-da\n,\ngervet2023act3d\n,\ngoyal2023rvt\n,\ngoyal2024rvt\n]\n. Addressing this limitation is crucial for developing embodied agents capable of adaptive and reliable interaction in complex, real-world environments.\nTo address this limitation, we propose\nActiveVLA\n, a novel vision-language-action framework that explicitly integrates active perception into robotic manipulation. ActiveVLA enables robots to adaptively and dynamically adjust their viewpoint and camera resolution according to the task context, allowing more informative observations to be acquired on demand. The framework equips robots with two complementary capabilities:\n(1)\nActive viewpoint selection\n, which autonomously determines optimal camera perspectives during task execution to maximize visibility and task relevance while minimizing occlusions; and\n(2)\nActive 3D zoom-in\n, which identifies and selectively enhances high-resolution views of task-critical regions within the 3D scene.\nBy dynamically refining its perceptual input through these mechanisms, ActiveVLA enables more precise, context-aware, and reliable action prediction, ultimately achieving superior adaptability and performance in complex, long-horizon manipulation scenarios.\nAs illustrated in Figure\nLABEL:teaser\n, ActiveVLA adopts a coarse-to-fine active perception design that integrates 3D spatial reasoning with vision-language understanding. In the\ncoarse stage\n, ActiveVLA projects the 3D point-cloud observations into multiple 2D orthographic views\n[\ngoyal2023rvt\n,\ngoyal2024rvt\n]\n, aligning them with the pretrained VLM backbone. By leveraging structural priors from the 3D inputs, the model effectively localizes salient and task-relevant regions in 3D space. In the\nfine stage\n, ActiveVLA performs active view selection to determine optimal camera poses centered on these key regions, maximizing amodal relevance and spatial diversity while reducing occlusions. It then applies an active 3D zoom-in strategy to enhance the spatial resolution of these areas, enabling precise manipulation of fine-grained details. This closed-loop, coarse-to-fine perception-action pipeline allows ActiveVLA to dynamically adapt its sensory inputs and maintain high effectiveness across complex, multi-step, and long-horizon manipulation tasks.\nComprehensive experiments validate the advantages of ActiveVLA. On RLBench\n[\njames2020rlbench\n]\n, it achieves an average success rate of 91.8%, with some tasks reaching a perfect success rate of 100%. On COLOSSEUM\n[\npumacay2024colosseum\n]\n, it achieves the highest success rate of 78.3% in challenging generalization scenarios. ActiveVLA consistently outperforms all baselines on GemBench\n[\ngarcia2024towards\n]\n, demonstrating superior adaptability across diverse tasks. Real-world evaluations further confirm its robustness and strong generalization to previously unseen configurations. These results demonstrate that integrating active perception into vision-language-action learning is a key step toward adaptive embodied intelligence.\nThe contributions of this paper are summarized:\n•\nActive Perception for Vision-Language-Action Models\n: We propose ActiveVLA, a novel vision-language-action framework that equips robots with active perception capabilities, enabling adaptive viewpoint selection and zoom-in mechanisms for precise, fine-grained manipulation.\n•\nA Novel ActiveVLA Framework\n: ActiveVLA designs a novel coarse-to-fine pipeline that projects 3D point clouds into multi-view 2D representations, predicts key regions via heatmaps, and selectively refines observations for precise, fine-grained manipulation.\n•\nState-of-the-Art Performance and Real-World Generalization\n: Extensive experiments on RLBench, COLOSSEUM, and GemBench demonstrate that ActiveVLA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Real-world robot evaluations show strong generalization and high success rates, highlighting the practical impact of active perception in long-horizon and precision-critical tasks.\n2\nRelated Work\nVision-Language-Action Models.\nRecent research has increasingly focused on developing generalist robot policies trained on large-scale robotic learning datasets\n[\no2023open-x\n,\nkhazatsky2024droid\n,\nfang2023rh20t\n,\ndasari2024ditpolicy\n,\nlin2024datascalinglawsimitation\n]\n. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a promising approach for training such policies\n[\nkim24openvla\n,\nembodiedcot\n,\n[pi0\n,\nwen2025dexvla\n,\npertsch2025fast\n,\nniu2024llarva\n,\ndiffusion-policy\n,\nzhou2025chatvla\n,\nding2025humanoid\n,\nzhao2025vlas\n,\nding2024quar\n,\ntong2024quart\n,\nliu2025spatial\n,\nwen2024tinyvla\n]\n. VLAs extend vision-language models (VLMs), which are pre-trained on massive internet-scale image and text datasets\n[\nzhu2024mipha\n,\nzhao2024cobra\n,\nzhu2024llavaphi\n,\nkaramcheti2024prismatic\n,\nwang2024qwen2\n,\nlu2024deepseek-vl\n,\nllava\n,\nllava1.5\n,\nabdin2024phi3\n,\nchen2024internvl\n]\n, to the domain of robotic control\n[\nwang2024distrl\n]\n. This approach provides several key advantages: leveraging large-scale vision-language model backbones with billions of parameters enables effective learning from vast robotic datasets, while reusing pre-trained weights from internet-scale data enhances VLAs’ ability to interpret diverse language commands and generalize to novel objects and environments, making them adaptable for real-world robotic applications.\nActiveVLA is a vision-language-action (VLA) framework that employs large-scale vision-language model backbones. Unlike previous methods, ActiveVLA further leverages the spatial structure of 3D inputs and utilizes active perception through novel view synthesis of 3D representations, resulting in greater adaptability and improved performance in manipulation tasks.\nFigure 1\n:\nThe pipeline of ActiveVLA.\nActiveVLA\nis a 3D vision-language-action framework that adopts a two-stage, coarse-to-fine strategy. In the\ncoarse stage\n, three orthographic projections of the 3D scene and a language instruction are processed by the PaliGemma backbone to generate 2D heatmaps, which are then back-projected to locate the most relevant 3D region. In the\nfine stage\n, an active perception module selects new views and performs a 3D zoom-in on this region. The refined PaliGemma then predicts heatmaps for key end-effector positions, while an action decoder outputs the final 3D action.\n3D Modalities in Robotic Learning.\nAlthough VLA models with 2D inputs have been extensively explored, incorporating 3D modalities into robot learning is still an emerging area of research\n[\nzhen20243d\n,\njia2024lift3d\n,\nliu2025reasongrounder\n,\nyang2025fp3\n,\nliu2025neural\n,\nli2025pointvla\n]\n. Recent studies have started leveraging richer spatial information to enhance robot perception and manipulation capabilities. Some approaches, such as 3DVLA\n[\nleo3d\n]\n, present holistic models for unified 3D tasks like generalization, visual question answering, 3D perception, and control. Other methods aim to improve the performance of foundational 2D models by integrating three-dimensional features. Lift3D\n[\njia2024lift3d\n]\naugments 2D vision backbones like DINOv2\n[\noquab2023dinov2\n]\nwith both implicit and explicit 3D representations. PointVLA\n[\nli2025pointvla\n]\nutilizes separate encoders for 2D images and 3D point clouds, merging their features in a downstream action predictor to inform decision-making. SpatialVLA\n[\nqu2025spatialvla\n]\nintroduces a specialized position encoding (Ego3D) to inject spatial information into 2D observations.\nHowever, most existing methods lack perceptual flexibility because the models cannot dynamically adjust their viewpoint or camera resolution. As a result, they fail to leverage the advantages of active, egocentric perception in robotic manipulation.\nIn contrast, ActiveVLA uses an active camera selection strategy to choose optimal viewpoints and an active 3D zoom-in mechanism to enhance point cloud resolution in key regions, leading to better performance in complex, long-horizon tasks.\n3\nOur Proposed ActiveVLA\nVLA Setup.\nVision-Language-Action models aim to learn a generalizable and robust multi-task robot manipulation policy\nπ\n\\pi\n.\nπ\n\\pi\nthat maps an observation\n𝐨\n\\mathbf{o}\nand a language instruction\nl\nl\nto an action\n𝐚\n\\mathbf{a}\n:\nπ\n:\n(\n𝐨\n,\nl\n)\n↦\n𝐚\n,\n\\pi:(\\mathbf{o},l)\\mapsto\\mathbf{a},\n(1)\nThe action\n𝐚\n\\mathbf{a}\nconsists of a 6-DoF end-effector pose\nT\n∈\nS\n​\nE\n​\n(\n3\n)\nT\\in SE(3)\n, a gripper state\ng\n∈\n{\n0\n,\n1\n}\ng\\in\\{0,1\\}\n, and a collision flag\nc\n∈\n{\n0\n,\n1\n}\nc\\in\\{0,1\\}\nof the next key frame. This setting assumes access to expert demonstrations\n𝒟\n=\n{\nτ\ni\n}\ni\n=\n1\nN\n\\mathcal{D}=\\{\\tau^{i}\\}_{i=1}^{N}\ncontaining\nN\nN\ntrajectories, where each trajectory contains a language instruction and a sequence of observation-action pairs,\ni.e.\n,\nτ\ni\n=\n{\nl\ni\n,\n(\n𝐨\n1\ni\n,\n𝐚\n1\ni\n)\n,\n…\n,\n(\n𝐨\nH\ni\n,\n𝐚\nH\ni\n)\n}\n\\tau^{i}=\\{l^{i},(\\mathbf{o}_{1}^{i},\\mathbf{a}_{1}^{i}),...,(\\mathbf{o}_{H}^{i},\\mathbf{a}_{H}^{i})\\}\n.\nThe observation\n𝐨\n\\mathbf{o}\ncontains RGB-D images captured from one or multiple fixed, end-effector-centric viewpoints. However, this setup limits perceptual flexibility by preventing dynamic viewpoint or resolution adjustment, hindering context acquisition and policy generalization.\nActiveVLA.\nAs shown in Figure\n1\n, ActiveVLA addresses the limitation of perceptual flexibility through a coarse-to-fine active perception framework that adaptively adjusts the camera’s viewpoint and zoom-in level according to the task context, thereby enhancing scene exploration and facilitating fine-grained interaction. By integrating 3D spatial reasoning with vision-language understanding, our approach progressively refines perceptual focus from a broad overview to task-critical regions, enhancing both contextual awareness and generalization.\nActiveVLA enables robots to attend to critical 3D regions and actively sense the environment, allowing adaptive viewpoints and zoom-in for fine-grained manipulation.\n3.1\n3D Crucial Area Perception\nDuring each task, ActiveVLA first identifies the core region in the 3D scene to serve as the focus for active perception.\nMulti-View Rendering.\nGiven RGB-D images as visual input, ActiveVLA reconstructs a point cloud of the scene using images captured by calibrated cameras. To match the 2D image input required by the VLM backbone, we render three orthographic projection images of the point cloud from top, front, and right viewpoints. Specifically, for each view, we render three image maps with a total of 7 channels: RGB, depth, and the coordinates of the points in the world frame (3 channels). The coordinates help establish the correspondence of pixels across views,\ni.e.\n, if pixels from different views share the same\n(\nx\n,\ny\n,\nz\n)\n(x,y,z)\n, they correspond to the same point in 3D. We use PyTorch3D\n[\nravi2020pytorch3d\n]\nfor rendering. The rendered image at viewpoint\nv\nv\nis given by:\nI\n(\nv\n)\n​\n(\nu\nx\n,\nu\ny\n)\n=\n∑\ni\n=\n1\nN\n𝐜\ni\n⋅\nδ\n​\n(\n(\nu\nx\n,\nu\ny\n)\n−\nπ\n(\nv\n)\n​\n(\n𝐩\ni\n)\n)\n,\nI^{(v)}(u_{x},u_{y})=\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\mathbf{c}_{i}\\cdot\\delta\\big((u_{x},u_{y})-\\pi^{(v)}(\\mathbf{p}_{i})\\big),\n(2)\nwhere\nπ\n(\nv\n)\n​\n(\n⋅\n)\n\\pi^{(v)}(\\cdot)\ndenotes the orthographic projection. The rendered color at each pixel is taken from the point with the minimal depth\nz\ni\n(\nv\n)\nz_{i}^{(v)}\namong all points projecting to that pixel, ensuring correct occlusion handling.\n3D Crucial Area Extraction.\nThese images are then used as input for the VLM backbone, which is designed to process images along with accompanying text prompts. Since the VLM’s global representations are not sufficient for precise spatial localization, we introduce a heatmap prediction module to recover fine-grained spatial attention and identify object positions within each view. To predict the heatmap, we first rearrange the output patch tokens\n{\n𝐭\ni\n}\ni\n=\n1\nM\n\\{\\mathbf{t}_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{M}\naccording to their spatial positions to form a feature grid. A convex upsampling block is then applied to the feature grid to obtain a heatmap that matches the resolution of the input image. This process can be expressed as:\n𝐇\n=\n𝒰\n​\n(\nRearrange\n​\n(\n{\n𝐭\ni\n}\ni\n=\n1\nM\n)\n)\n,\n\\mathbf{H}=\\mathcal{U}\\Big(\\mathrm{Rearrange}\\big(\\{\\mathbf{t}_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{M}\\big)\\Big),\n(3)\nwhere\n𝒰\n​\n(\n⋅\n)\n\\mathcal{U}(\\cdot)\ndenotes the convex upsampling block, and\nRearrange\n​\n(\n⋅\n)\n\\mathrm{Rearrange}(\\cdot)\nrearranges the tokens into a feature grid of size\nH\np\n×\nW\np\nH_{p}\\times W_{p}\n.\nUnlike fixed interpolation methods, the upsampling module learns pixel-wise weights for finer spatial detail recovery. The pipeline is trained with cross-entropy loss to predict heatmaps, which are then back-projected from all views to identify the crucial 3D region.\n3.2\n3D Active Perception\nActiveVLA enables active perception, allowing robots to perform fine-grained manipulation. It includes two components: Active Viewpoint Selection and Active 3D Zoom-in.\nActive Viewpoint Selection.\nTo improve perceptual completeness in complex scenes, ActiveVLA proposes a hypothesis testing strategy for selecting active views that focuses on optimal camera viewpoints centered on key regions identified during the coarse stage. The goal is to maximize amodal relevance by ensuring full visibility of target objects and increasing view diversity. Together, these objectives help reduce occlusion and perceptual ambiguity through complementary observations.\nGiven the 3D key region of interest\np\nf\n∈\nℝ\n3\np_{f}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}\n(e.g., the centroid of a partially observed object), we generate a set of candidate camera positions uniformly distributed around a sphere centered at\np\nf\np_{f}\n.\nTo achieve isotropic coverage, we employ a geodesic sampling strategy based on recursive subdivision of a regular icosahedron, producing a near-uniform point distribution on the spherical surface. This avoids sampling biases inherent in latitude-longitude parameterizations and provides scalable control over viewpoint density via subdivision level.\nThe total number of sampling points\nV\n​\n(\nk\n)\nV(k)\nafter\nk\nk\n-level recursive subdivision (where\nk\n∈\nℕ\nk\\in\\mathbb{N}\n, a non-negative integer) is quantitatively described as:\nV\n​\n(\nk\n)\n=\n12\n+\n30\n​\nk\n+\n20\n3\n​\n(\n4\nk\n−\n1\n)\n,\nV(k)=12+30k+\\frac{20}{3}\\left(4^{k}-1\\right),\n(4)\nwhere\nk\n=\n0\nk=0\ncorresponds to the original icosahedron (12 vertices), and higher\nk\nk\nindicates successive subdivisions. Each candidate camera position\nc\ni\nc_{i}\nis evaluated using a multi-objective scoring function that balances three criteria:\n•\nVisibility\n: ActiveVLA determines whether the line of sight from\nc\ni\nc_{i}\nto\np\nf\np_{f}\nis occluded by scene geometry. Using a KDTree-based nearest-neighbor search on the observed point cloud\n𝒮\n\\mathcal{S}\n, it samples\nN\nN\nuniformly spaced points\n{\nq\nk\n}\n\\{q_{k}\\}\nalong the ray and computes their nearest-surface distances:\nd\nk\n=\nmin\ns\n∈\n𝒮\n⁡\n‖\nq\nk\n−\ns\n‖\n.\nd_{k}=\\min_{s\\in\\mathcal{S}}\\|q_{k}-s\\|.\n(5)\nIf all distances exceed a threshold\nr\nr\n(\nd\nk\n≥\nr\n,\n∀\nk\nd_{k}\\geq r,\\,\\forall k\n), the view is marked unoccluded with\nv\n​\n(\nc\ni\n,\np\nf\n)\n=\n1\nv(c_{i},p_{f})=1\n; otherwise,\nv\n​\n(\nc\ni\n,\np\nf\n)\n=\n0\nv(c_{i},p_{f})=0\n.\n•\nDistance\n: We normalize the distance\n‖\nc\ni\n−\np\nf\n‖\n\\|c_{i}-p_{f}\\|\nand standardize it across candidates to prefer moderate viewing ranges that balance field-of-view and detail resolution.\n•\nDiversity\n:\nTo ensure geometric diversity among selected viewpoints, we compute the total angular separation between the viewing direction of\nc\ni\nc_{i}\nand all other candidates. Given candidate set\n𝒞\n=\n{\nc\n1\n,\n…\n,\nc\nM\n}\n\\mathcal{C}=\\{c_{1},\\dots,c_{M}\\}\nand unit viewing vectors\n𝐯\ni\n∈\n𝕊\n2\n\\mathbf{v}_{i}\\in\\mathbb{S}^{2}\n, the diversity score is defined as:\nS\ndiv\n​\n(\nc\ni\n)\n=\n∑\nj\n≠\ni\narccos\n⁡\n(\n𝐯\ni\n⋅\n𝐯\nj\n)\n,\nS_{\\text{div}}(c_{i})=\\sum_{j\\neq i}\\arccos(\\mathbf{v}_{i}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}_{j}),\n(6)\nA larger\nS\ndiv\n​\n(\nc\ni\n)\nS_{\\text{div}}(c_{i})\nindicates greater angular diversity and more spatially distributed views.\nThese scores are Z-normalized and combined into a unified score:\ns\ni\n=\nw\nvis\n⋅\ns\nvis\n+\nw\ndis\n⋅\ns\ndis\n+\nw\ndiv\n⋅\ns\ndiv\n,\ns_{i}=w_{\\text{vis}}\\cdot s_{\\text{vis}}+w_{\\text{dis}}\\cdot s_{\\text{dis}}+w_{\\text{div}}\\cdot s_{\\text{div}},\n(7)\nwhere\nw\nvis\n+\nw\ndis\n+\nw\ndiv\n=\n1\nw_{\\text{vis}}+w_{\\text{dis}}+w_{\\text{div}}=1\nare the weighting coefficients,\ns\nvis\ns_{\\text{vis}}\ndenotes the visibility score,\ns\ndis\ns_{\\text{dis}}\ndenotes the distance score, and\ns\ndiv\ns_{\\text{div}}\ndenotes the diversity score. The top-\nK\nK\nhighest-scoring views are selected as the next observation poses. Each camera is configured using the look-at formulation with eye\nc\ni\nc_{i}\n, target\np\nf\np_{f}\n, and a dynamically adjusted up vector. These views enable informative, unoccluded observations that support robust multi-view reasoning and precise manipulation, with the most informative view serving as the basis for active 3D zoom-in.\nActive 3D Zoom-in.\nPrevious VLA models rely on fixed camera views around the robot, which often fail to capture sufficient detail for fine-grained tasks involving small objects (e.g.,\nwelding a hole using a welding gun\n).\nTo overcome this limitation, ActiveVLA introduces an active 3D zoom-in mechanism that adaptively refines visual perception around key interaction regions. After selecting the optimal viewpoint, the system re-renders the scene from the same camera pose with a narrowed field of view, effectively magnifying the local region while maintaining high pixel resolution for precise gripper pose prediction. This simulates an optical zoom effect in virtual rendering space, enabling detailed observation of small-scale structures without loss of visual fidelity. Let\nα\n\\alpha\ndenote the original FoV (in radians),\nz\n>\n1\nz>1\nthe zoom-in factor, and\nd\nd\nthe distance from the camera to the region of interest. The spatial coverage width\nW\nW\nof the rendered image (perpendicular to the viewing direction) is given by:\nW\n​\n(\nz\n)\n=\n2\n​\nd\n​\ntan\n⁡\n(\nα\n2\n​\nz\n)\n,\nW(z)=2d\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2z}\\right),\n(8)\nwhere\nW\n​\n(\nz\n)\nW(z)\ndecreases with increasing\nz\nz\n, while pixel resolution\nR\nR\nis preserved as\nR\n=\nimage width (pixels)\nW\n​\n(\nz\n)\nR=\\frac{\\text{image width (pixels)}}{W(z)}\n, ensuring higher detail in the magnified region.\nThe zoom-in process leverages the 3D point cloud for scale-invariant view synthesis without geometric loss. Unlike fixed physical cameras, the virtual renderer produces high-resolution close-ups based on local 3D structure, enhancing gripper pose accuracy.

It effectively infers object geometry and spatial relations through 3D perception, actively selects informative viewpoints, and executes fine-grained actions to complete the tasks successfully. Even when key targets are heavily occluded by other objects or environmental structures, ActiveVLA maintains high accuracy and stability, reflecting its robust spatial understanding and adaptive control in real-world conditions.\n4.2\nAblation Study\nTable 4:\nAblation study on key components.\nWe report the success rate (%) and inference time (s) over 100 trials.

Experiments are evaluated on the RLBench benchmark.\nHyperparameter Analysis.\nWe analyze the effects of the\nNumber of Views\nand\nZoom-in Factor\non ActiveVLA.\nAs shown in Figure\n4\n, increasing the number of views improves the success rate from 82.2% (one view) to 91.8% (three views), confirming that multi-view observation enhances spatial understanding and mitigates occlusion.\nBeyond three views, the performance saturates while computational cost increases.\nSimilarly, increasing the zoom-in factor from 1 to 4 boosts precision by enabling finer-grained perception, whereas excessive zoom reduces contextual awareness.\nTherefore, we set the number of views to 3 and the zoom-in factor to 4 for all experiments, striking a balance between global context and local detail.\n5\nConclusion\nThis paper presents ActiveVLA, a vision-language-action framework that integrates active perception into robotic manipulation.\nBy incorporating Active View Selection and Active 3D Zoom-in within a coarse-to-fine architecture, ActiveVLA enables robots to dynamically adapt their observation strategies for enhanced spatial reasoning and fine-grained control.\nBy leveraging multi-view 3D perception aligned with VLMs, ActiveVLA effectively balances global context and fine-grained local detail during manipulation.\nExperiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate its superior performance across diverse tasks.\nReferences\n\\thetitle\nSupplementary Material\n1\nVideo\nThe attached video demonstrates the capabilities of our proposed\nActiveVLA\n, a vision–language–action framework that transforms perception from a passive sensing mechanism into an active, hypothesis-driven process. Unlike prior VLA systems that rely on static or wrist-mounted cameras and thus fail under severe occlusion, ActiveVLA explicitly integrates\nactive viewpoint selection\nand\nactive 3D zoom-in\nto dynamically acquire high-quality visual information.\nThe video consists of four manipulation scenarios intentionally designed with\ncomplex occlusion patterns, challenging spatial relationships, and fine-grained geometric constraints\n. In each scenario, the robot must actively decide both\nwhere to look\nand\nwhat region to zoom into\nbefore determining\nhow to act\n. Below, we provide a technically detailed explanation of each task.\nTask 1: “Retrieving a Towel from Layered Drawers”\nTechnical challenge summary:\nThis task contains\nself-induced structural occlusion\ncaused by multi-layer drawer geometry, where the target towel is partially or fully hidden behind drawer faces, internal shadows, and nested surfaces. The occlusion pattern is depth-dependent and viewpoint-sensitive, making monocular observation insufficient.\nIn this scenario, the towel resides inside a stack of layered drawers, where only a small portion of its surface is visible from most viewpoints. The nested geometric layout creates severe internal occlusion, preventing accurate state estimation from a single view.\n•\nActiveVLA performs\nactive viewpoint probing\n, selecting camera poses that maximize visibility of internal drawer regions and break geometric occlusion cycles.\n•\nAfter obtaining partial exposure of the towel surface, ActiveVLA triggers\nactive 3D zoom-in\nto construct a high-resolution local representation, enabling precise localization of edges, depth discontinuities, and graspable regions despite the heavy geometric occlusion.\nThis scenario demonstrates ActiveVLA’s ability to resolve internal structural occlusion and extract fine-grained geometry for accurate picking.\nTask 2: “Picking a Red Block and Placing It onto a Green Block”\nTechnical challenge summary:\nThis scene features\nmulti-object mutual occlusion\nand\nlong-horizon relational constraints\n. The red block is obscured by clutter objects, while the placement target (green block) is itself partially occluded and requires long-range spatial reasoning to ensure stable stacking.\nIn this cluttered tabletop setting, the red block is heavily obscured by surrounding objects, and its visible surface varies drastically across viewpoints. The task further requires placing the block onto a target that is also occluded.\n•\nThrough\nocclusion-aware viewpoint planning\n, ActiveVLA obtains a sequence of camera poses that reveal the red block’s true geometry and reduce ambiguity arising from clutter-induced occlusion.\n•\nWith the red and green blocks exposed, ActiveVLA applies\ntargeted 3D zoom-in\nto build a high-resolution geometric representation of both objects, enabling accurate grasping and stable long-horizon placement.\nThis task highlights ActiveVLA’s capability to jointly resolve clutter occlusion and plan fine-grained manipulation over extended horizons.\nTask 3: “Grasping an Occluded Banana Among Multiple Fruits”\nTechnical challenge summary:\nThis scenario presents\ndense, heterogeneous occlusion\nwhere the target (banana) is partially surrounded and occluded by fruits of irregular shapes. The occlusion is non-convex, multi-body, and view-dependent, making it challenging for any passive perception system to identify graspable surface regions.\nThe banana is deeply embedded within a bowl of multiple fruits, with only tiny fragments of its surface visible from typical camera views. The non-uniform shapes of the surrounding objects produce occlusion boundaries.\n•\nActiveVLA performs\nviewpoint sweeps\nto uncover minimal exposed areas of the banana, actively reducing multi-object occlusion by selecting informative perspectives.\n•\nUpon identifying a candidate grasp region, ActiveVLA uses\nactive 3D zoom-in\nto extract high-resolution local geometry, ensuring a stable and collision-free grasp while preserving the arrangement of surrounding fruits.\nTable 5:\nSuccess rates (%) on the Real-World Experiment.\nWe compare our\nActiveVLA\nwith more baselines on real-world tasks. The tasks involve complex spatial occlusion and manipulation.\nMethod\nRetrieving Towel\nRed to Green Block\nOccluded Banana\nOccluded Purple Cup\nOverall\nDiffusion Policy\n26\n±\n2\n26\\scriptstyle{\\pm 2}\n38\n±\n4\n38\\scriptstyle{\\pm 4}\n42\n±\n2\n42\\scriptstyle{\\pm 2}\n35\n±\n2\n35\\scriptstyle{\\pm 2}\n35.3\nVPP\n52\n±\n2\n52\\scriptstyle{\\pm 2}\n48\n±\n7\n48\\scriptstyle{\\pm 7}\n58\n±\n2\n58\\scriptstyle{\\pm 2}\n64\n±\n3\n64\\scriptstyle{\\pm 3}\n55.5\nTriVLA\n68\n±\n4\n68\\scriptstyle{\\pm 4}\n54\n±\n3\n54\\scriptstyle{\\pm 3}\n62\n±\n2\n62\\scriptstyle{\\pm 2}\n72\n±\n2\n72\\scriptstyle{\\pm 2}\n64.0\nRVT-2\n77\n±\n4\n77\\scriptstyle{\\pm 4}\n63\n±\n2\n63\\scriptstyle{\\pm 2}\n72\n±\n4\n72\\scriptstyle{\\pm 4}\n78\n±\n5\n78\\scriptstyle{\\pm 5}\n72.5\nActiveVLA (ours)\n𝟗𝟐\n±\n𝟐\n\\mathbf{92\\scriptstyle{\\pm 2}}\n𝟗𝟓\n±\n𝟑\n\\mathbf{95\\scriptstyle{\\pm 3}}\n𝟗𝟏\n±\n𝟓\n\\mathbf{91\\scriptstyle{\\pm 5}}\n𝟖𝟗\n±\n𝟐\n\\mathbf{89\\scriptstyle{\\pm 2}}\n91.8\nThis task demonstrates ActiveVLA’s ability to handle dense, irregular occlusion structures and perform precision manipulation in cluttered environments.\nTask 4: “Retrieving an Occluded Purple Cup from a Hanging Rack”\nTechnical challenge summary:\nThis task involves\nrelational occlusion among articulated or suspended objects\n. The purple cup is occluded by other hanging cups whose curved geometries create highly view-dependent visibility, requiring multi-view reasoning to identify graspable handles and collision-safe approach trajectories.\nThe target purple cup is positioned behind multiple hanging cups on a rack. From several viewpoints, its handle and graspable regions are entirely invisible due to occlusion.\n•\nActiveVLA evaluates the occlusion graph of the hanging rack and selects\noptimal exploratory viewpoints\nthat maximally expose the occluded cup without disturbing neighboring objects.\n•\nAfter isolating the purple cup visually,\n3D zoom-in\nis applied to recover detailed geometry around the handle region, enabling precise grasping and safe extraction.\nThis scenario showcases ActiveVLA’s strength in reasoning about occlusion in relational object structures, and performing grasping under strict collision constraints.\n2\nAdditional Quantitative Results\nWe conduct further quantitative evaluations on real-world manipulation tasks that involve complex spatial arrangements and occlusions. The selected tasks include:\n1)\nRetrieving a Towel from Layered Drawers\n, which requires reasoning about objects partially hidden in layered drawer configurations;\n2)\nPicking a Red Block and Placing It onto a Green Block\n, requiring precise spatial alignment under cluttered conditions;\n3)\nGrasping an Occluded Banana Among Multiple Fruits\n, which tests the model’s ability to identify and manipulate partially obstructed objects;\n4)\nRetrieving an Occluded Purple Cup from a Hanging Rack\n, which involves fine-grained spatial reasoning.\nTable\n5\npresents the success rates of baselines, including Diffusion Policy, VPP, TriVLA, and RVT-2, as well as our proposed ActiveVLA. Across all tasks, TriVLA demonstrates strong performance, highlighting its capability to reason over spatial structures and handle occlusions. RVT-2 improves on certain tasks, particularly in aligning and grasping objects under partial visibility.\nActiveVLA further advances performance by leveraging\nactive perception\n, enabling the agent to autonomously select informative viewpoints, dynamically adjust camera zoom, and focus on regions of interest. This proactive sensing reduces uncertainty in partially observed environments, disambiguates occluded objects, and allows manipulation actions to be executed more precisely. Quantitatively, ActiveVLA improves the success rate over TriVLA by 24% on\nRetrieving a Towel\n, 41% on\nRed to Green Block\n, 29% on\nOccluded Banana\n, and 17% on\nOccluded Purple Cup\n, achieving an overall success rate of 96.3%.\nThese results demonstrate that integrating active perception with high-level policy reasoning is crucial for real-world robotic manipulation, particularly in cluttered and occluded environments. Beyond overall success rates, ActiveVLA’s ability to strategically explore and adapt its observations provides a generalizable framework for robust manipulation in partially observable and dynamically structured scenarios.\nTable 6\n:\nSuccess rates (%) of ActiveVLA under different perturbations in COLOSSEUM.\nWe report mean and standard deviation over multiple trials for tasks with diverse visual and spatial perturbations.\nActiveVLA achieves consistently high performance, demonstrating robustness to environmental variations and the benefit of active perception for precise manipulation.\nTask

Implementation Details\nTraining Stages.\nActiveVLA is optimized through sequential stages: training on RLBench, COLOSSEUM, GemBench, and finally real-world robot data. All stages share an identical optimization pipeline. Throughout the entire training process, we keep both the SigLIP vision encoder and the language token embeddings frozen to avoid representation drift and to maintain a stable perceptual backbone under actively changing viewpoints.\nRLBench Training.\nFor RLBench, we adopt a learning rate of\n8\n×\n10\n−\n5\n8\\times 10^{-5}\nwith AdamW and a batch size of 192, without warmup. Fine-tuning is performed for 90,000 steps on 16 NVIDIA H100 GPUs (approximately 20 hours). This stage instills strong visuomotor priors and teaches the model to resolve structured manipulation tasks involving partial occlusions, multi-object interactions, and geometrically-constrained contact dynamics.\nCOLOSSEUM Training.\nThe COLOSSEUM stage uses the same optimization configuration as RLBench: a learning rate of\n8\n×\n10\n−\n5\n8\\times 10^{-5}\n, AdamW, batch size 192, and no warmup. Training spans 90,000 steps on 16 NVIDIA H100 GPUs (about 20 hours). Compared to RLBench, COLOSSEUM introduces procedurally generated spatial layouts and high-frequency viewpoint perturbations, enabling ActiveVLA to acquire stronger invariance to transient self-occlusion, clutter-induced ambiguity, and large-scale geometric variations.\nGemBench Training.\nFor GemBench, we maintain the learning rate of\n8\n×\n10\n−\n5\n8\\times 10^{-5}\nand AdamW while adjusting the batch size to 160 to accommodate longer trajectories and higher per-sample memory cost. Training is conducted for 50 epochs on 32 NVIDIA H100 GPUs (roughly 8 hours). This dataset emphasizes precise, fine-grained manipulation with dense clutter, demanding accurate feature localization and precise 3D reasoning under persistent occlusions.\nReal-robot Fine-tuning.\nIn the final stage, we adapt the model to real-world data using a smaller learning rate of\n2\n×\n10\n−\n5\n2\\times 10^{-5}\nwith AdamW and a batch size of 192. Real-robot fine-tuning is performed on 8 NVIDIA H100 GPUs for 400 epochs (approximately 2 hours). This step calibrates ActiveVLA’s viewpoint selection and 3D zoom-in modules to real sensor noise, illumination variations, and complex, non-procedural occlusion patterns encountered during physical execution.\nTraining Stability and Optimization Notes.\nAcross all stages, we apply gradient clipping at a maximum norm of 1.0 and use cosine learning rate decay. Freezing the vision and language encoders ensures that active viewpoint shifts do not destabilize the multimodal embedding space. Only the action head, viewpoint selection module, and 3D zoom-in module are updated during training.\nFigure 5\n:\nVisualization of 18 RLBench tasks.\nThe tasks cover a diverse set of manipulation challenges, including object grasping, tool use, and complex spatial interactions, illustrating the range of scenarios used for evaluation.\n4\nDetails of Simulation Tasks\nFor the simulation, ActiveVLA is evaluated across three major benchmarks, covering a broad distribution of manipulation difficulty, task compositionality, and robustness challenges. As shown in Figure\n5\n, these benchmarks include structured multi-step manipulation, perturbation-heavy robustness evaluation, and hierarchical skill composition, collectively forming a comprehensive simulation suite. This section provides a detailed overview of these simulation domains. The experimental results are shown in Table\n6\n.\nRLBench.\nRLBench serves as the foundational simulation benchmark for ActiveVLA, consisting of 18 visually and physically diverse manipulation tasks executed using a 7-DoF Franka Panda manipulator. Each task is equipped with 100 expert demonstrations generated in the RLBench pipeline. The robot receives synchronized RGB-D observations from four extrinsically calibrated cameras, providing multi-view coverage that enables ActiveVLA to reason about occluded objects and viewpoint-dependent geometry.\nRLBench tasks span fine-grained pick-and-place operations, articulated-object interactions, and multi-stage routines requiring precise control of contact transitions. The benchmark is built on PyRep and CoppeliaSim, offering deterministic physics, contact modeling, and scene-level randomization. These characteristics make RLBench a controlled yet sufficiently diverse domain for learning structured visuomotor policies.\nCOLOSSEUM.\nCOLOSSEUM extends RLBench into a perturbation-rich robustness benchmark by introducing 12 systematic variation types across object geometry, material, scene layout, kinematics, lighting, and camera configuration. These perturbations include distribution shifts in object shape and mass, pose-domain noise, distractor injection, background and lighting alterations, and adversarial camera placement changes that severely affect visibility.\nEach perturbation type is procedurally generated with controlled parameter ranges, enabling a quantitative evaluation of robustness under viewpoint changes and occlusion-induced ambiguity. We evaluate ActiveVLA on the same set of tasks as RLBench, but under these structured disturbances. Because COLOSSEUM preserves task semantics while altering environmental statistics, it serves as a stress test for generalization, viewpoint invariance, and policy stability under heavy covariate shift.\nFigure 6\n:\nVisualization of direct manipulation tasks.\nThese tasks evaluate baseline visuomotor skills and include cloth manipulation, highlighting varying physical and spatial challenges.\nFigure 7\n:\nVisualization of occlusion-heavy and spatially complex tasks.\nThese tasks challenge ActiveVLA’s active viewpoint selection and 3D zoom-in capabilities. They include multi-layered drawer retrieval (\ntowel\n), high-precision stacking with partial occlusion (\nred to green block\n), collision-aware grasping in clutter (\noccluded banana\n), and narrow-grasp extraction from a hanging rack (\npurple cup\n), highlighting severe occlusions, complex geometry, and fine-grained 6D pose reasoning.\nGemBench.\nGemBench is a hierarchical generalization benchmark built upon RLBench. It decomposes manipulation into seven core action primitives (e.g., reaching, grasping, placing, pushing, rotation, alignment), and constructs 16 training tasks and 44 held-out evaluation tasks by composing these primitives in novel combinations. Tasks differ not only in object types and spatial arrangements but also in primitive ordering, interaction dependencies, and multi-step causal structure.\nUnlike RLBench and COLOSSEUM, where each task follows a predefined demonstration distribution, GemBench requires learning from primitive-level structure and recombining them to solve previously unseen compositions. This setting challenges the model’s ability to perform long-horizon reasoning, adapt to unfamiliar task graphs, and maintain consistent visuomotor grounding across compositional variations.\nThe benchmark uses the Franka Panda robot under RLBench physics, with additional environment-induced occlusions and clutter not present in the base tasks. Evaluating on GemBench allows us to measure ActiveVLA’s capacity for skill recomposition, cross-task transfer, and manipulation generalization at the structural level.\n5\nDetails of Real-Robot Tasks\nWe evaluate ActiveVLA on a diverse set of real-robot manipulation tasks that span basic object handling, articulated-object interaction, non-prehensile control, and complex occlusion-heavy scenarios. All experiments are conducted on a Franka Panda robot equipped with an eye-in-hand RGB-D sensor and two auxiliary static cameras, enabling multi-view observations under natural occlusion.\nDirect Manipulation Tasks.\nAs shown in Figure\n6\n, the first group consists of relatively straightforward manipulation tasks designed to assess baseline visuomotor competence:\n•\nWiping the table with a towel\n: The robot grasps a deformable pink towel and wipes a specified region of a black tabletop. Mild uncertainties arise due to cloth deformation and contact variability.\n•\nPicking up an orange and placing it into a basket\n: The robot must reliably grasp a spherical object and place it into a confined container, requiring stable grasp synthesis and precise placement.\n•\nOpening an orange drawer and placing a mouse inside\n: This sequential task requires articulated-object manipulation, followed by object retrieval and placement within a restricted drawer volume.\n•\nPushing a blue bowl in front of a green plate\n: A non-prehensile manipulation task that relies on continuous contact and collision-free motion in a cluttered planar environment.\n•\nPressing a red button on the desk\n: A reach-and-interact task requiring accurate end-effector pose control but minimal physical complexity.\nOcclusion-Heavy and Spatially Complex Tasks.\nAs shown in Figure\n7\n,\nThe second group contains tasks explicitly designed to challenge ActiveVLA’s active viewpoint selection and 3D zoom-in mechanisms. These tasks include severe occlusion, multi-layer geometry, and fine-grained 6D pose reasoning:\n•\nRetrieving a towel from layered drawers\n: The robot must identify the correct drawer, reason about partial occlusions, actuate the drawer, and extract the towel from a tightly constrained multi-layer structure.\n•\nPicking a red block and placing it onto a green block\n: A high-precision stacking task where the target object is partially occluded or surrounded by distractors, demanding fine-grained localization and vertical alignment.\n•\nGrasping an occluded banana among multiple fruits\n: The banana is frequently hidden beneath or between other fruits, requiring collision-aware grasp planning and viewpoint selection in dense clutter.\n•\nRetrieving an occluded purple cup from a hanging rack\n: The rack geometry induces persistent occlusions and narrow allowable grasp regions. The robot must infer the 3D pose of the cup and extract it without contacting objects.\nThese occlusion-heavy tasks pose substantially greater challenges due to compounded visibility constraints, irregular geometry, and the need for precise 6D pose inference.",
  "preview_text": "Recent advances in robot manipulation have leveraged pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) and explored integrating 3D spatial signals into these models for effective action prediction, giving rise to the promising vision-language-action (VLA) paradigm. However, most existing approaches overlook the importance of active perception: they typically rely on static, wrist-mounted cameras that provide an end-effector-centric viewpoint. As a result, these models are unable to adaptively select optimal viewpoints or resolutions during task execution, which significantly limits their performance in long-horizon tasks and fine-grained manipulation scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose ActiveVLA, a novel vision-language-action framework that empowers robots with active perception capabilities for high-precision, fine-grained manipulation. ActiveVLA adopts a coarse-to-fine paradigm, dividing the process into two stages: (1) Critical region localization. ActiveVLA projects 3D inputs onto multi-view 2D projections, identifies critical 3D regions, and supports dynamic spatial awareness. (2) Active perception optimization. Drawing on the localized critical regions, ActiveVLA uses an active view selection strategy to choose optimal viewpoints. These viewpoints aim to maximize amodal relevance and diversity while minimizing occlusions. Additionally, ActiveVLA applies a 3D zoom-in to improve resolution in key areas. Together, these steps enable finer-grained active perception for precise manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ActiveVLA achieves precise 3D manipulation and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on three simulation benchmarks. Moreover, ActiveVLA transfers seamlessly to real-world scenarios, enabling robots to learn high-precision tasks in complex environments.\n\nActiveVLA: Injecting Active Perception into Vision-Language-Action Models for Precise 3D Robotic Manipulation\nZhenyang Liu\n1,2\n, Yongchong Gu\n1\n, Yikai Wang\n3\n1\n1\nfootnotemark:\n1",

      "answer": "## 论文核心分析：ActiveVLA\n\n### **一、 核心问题**\n现有的大多数视觉-语言-动作模型在机器人操作中存在一个根本性缺陷：**感知是被动的**。它们通常依赖于固定的（如手腕安装的）摄像头，提供单一的、以末端执行器为中心的视角。这导致了两个关键问题：\n1.  **无法自适应选择最优视角**：在长时程任务或复杂场景中，机器人无法主动调整视角以获取关键信息（如被遮挡的物体）。\n2.  **无法动态调整分辨率**：对于需要精细操作的场景（如插入小孔），固定的全局视图无法提供足够的细节。\n\n这些问题严重限制了VLA模型在**长时程、细粒度、高精度**操作任务中的性能和泛化能力。\n\n### **二、 核心创新点**\n论文提出了 **ActiveVLA** 框架，其核心创新在于**将主动感知能力注入到视觉-语言-动作模型中**。这并非简单的模块叠加，而是一个系统性的范式转变，使机器人从“被动看”变为“主动探”。\n\n具体创新体现在以下三个层面：\n\n1.  **范式创新：主动感知的VLA框架**\n    *   **核心理念**：将感知视为一个主动的、假设驱动的过程，机器人能够根据任务上下文动态调整“看哪里”和“看多细”。\n    *   **与现有工作的区别**：不同于大多数仅处理静态2D图像或简单融合3D特征的VLA模型，ActiveVLA首次系统地将**主动视角选择**和**主动3D放大**作为核心机制集成到学习框架中。\n\n2.  **方法创新：由粗到精的两阶段主动感知管道**\n    ActiveVLA采用一个精心设计的**两阶段（由粗到精）管道**来解决上述问题：\n\n    *   **第一阶段：粗粒度 - 3D关键区域定位**\n        - **输入**：将3D点云投影到**多视图（顶视、前视、右视）的2D正交图像**，以适配预训练的VLM骨干网络。\n        - **处理**：VLM处理这些图像和语言指令，通过一个**热图预测模块**来定位任务相关的关键区域。\n        - **输出**：将2D热图反投影回3D空间，**识别出需要重点关注的三维区域**。\n\n    *   **第二阶段：细粒度 - 主动感知优化**\n        - **主动视角选择**：围绕第一阶段定位的关键3D区域，生成一组候选相机位姿。通过一个**多目标评分函数**（综合考虑**可见性**、**距离**和**视角多样性**）来选择最优的K个视角，以最大化信息获取并最小化遮挡。\n        - **主动3D放大**：在选定的最优视角上，**虚拟地缩小渲染视场角**，对关键区域进行高分辨率“放大”。这相当于在3D渲染空间中进行光学变焦，**在不损失像素分辨率的前提下获取局部细节**，公式为：`W(z) = 2d * tan(α/(2z))`，其中`z`为放大因子。\n\n3.  **架构创新：3D感知与VLM的深度对齐**\n    *   设计了一个**热图反投影与多视图得分融合**的机制，将2D VLM的注意力准确地映射到3D动作空间。\n    *   采用**全局-局部特征融合**的头部网络，结合场景的整体语义和ROI内的精细几何信息，来预测6-DoF末端执行器位姿、夹爪状态和碰撞标志。\n\n### **三、 解决方案总结**\n**一句话概括**：ActiveVLA通过一个**由粗到精的主动感知管道**，使机器人能够先**定位**任务关键区域，再**动态选择**最佳观测视角并**放大**局部细节，从而实现了对复杂、遮挡严重、需精细操作任务的高精度3D操控。\n\n**技术路径**：\n```\n问题（被动感知） \n→ 思路（注入主动感知） \n→ 框架（两阶段管道） \n→ 阶段一（3D关键区域定位：多视图投影 + VLM热图） \n→ 阶段二（主动优化：视角选择 + 3D放大） \n→ 输出（高精度6-DoF动作）\n```\n\n### **四、 实际价值**\n1.  **性能提升**：在RLBench、COLOSSEUM、GemBench三个仿真基准测试中均达到**最先进水平**，尤其在需要应对遮挡和细节的任务上优势明显（如RLBench平均成功率91.8%）。\n2.  **强泛化与鲁棒性**：在包含多种扰动（颜色、纹理、大小、相机位姿等）的COLOSSEUM基准上表现优异，证明了其对环境变化的鲁棒性。\n3.  **仿真到现实的迁移**：在真实机器人实验中，能够成功完成**高度遮挡、结构复杂**的精细操作任务（如从分层抽屉中取毛巾、从水果堆中抓被遮挡的香蕉），验证了其在实际场景中的有效性和实用性。\n4.  **方向性贡献**：为具身智能和机器人操作领域指明了一个重要方向——**将感知从静态数据驱动转变为动态任务驱动**，是迈向更自适应、更可靠机器人的关键一步。",

      "answer": "## 论文分析：ActiveVLA 及其技术脉络梳理\n\n基于对论文 **《ActiveVLA: Injecting Active Perception into Vision-Language-Action Models for Precise 3D Robotic Manipulation》** 的深入阅读，以下将梳理从传统视觉语言动作模型到ActiveVLA的整个发展脉络，重点分析每一步的核心改进和几个关键发展方向。\n\n### 一、 发展脉络总览\n\n这个领域的发展主线是：**从被动感知的2D模型 -> 引入3D空间信息的模型 -> 最终实现主动感知的3D模型**。其核心驱动力是解决机器人操作中因**固定视角、分辨率不足和遮挡**导致的泛化性差和精细操作能力弱的问题。\n\n### 二、 关键发展阶段与技术演进\n\n#### 阶段一：基于2D图像的视觉语言动作模型\n*   **代表工作**：早期的VLA模型，如基于CNN或ViT的Image-BC方法。\n*   **核心思想**：直接利用在互联网规模数据上预训练的大规模视觉语言模型作为主干，处理2D RGB图像和语言指令，输出动作。旨在利用VLM强大的语义理解和泛化能力。\n*   **改进与局限**：\n    *   **改进**：引入了大规模预训练的先验知识，减少了对机器人专用数据的依赖，在理解和响应自然语言指令方面表现出色。\n    *   **局限**：**缺乏3D空间推理能力**。模型需要海量数据来弥合2D感知与3D动作之间的鸿沟，在需要精确空间关系的任务（如插入、堆叠）上表现不佳，且对视角变化非常敏感。\n\n#### 阶段二：引入3D模态的VLA模型\n*   **代表工作**：PerAct, Act3D, RVT, 3D Diffuser Actor, BridgeVLA, 以及论文中提到的Lift3D、PointVLA、SpatialVLA等。\n*   **核心思想**：认识到纯2D输入的局限性，开始将3D点云、体素等空间表征融入模型。这些方法通常将3D场景投影到多个2D视图，或使用3D编码器，以捕获几何和结构信息。\n*   **改进与局限**：\n    *   **改进**：\n        1.  **空间推理增强**：通过3D数据提供了固有的结构线索，显著提升了**样本效率**和**空间推理能力**，在复杂操作任务上性能大幅超越纯2D模型。\n        2.  **表征方式多样**：不同工作探索了不同的3D-2D融合方式（如多视图正交投影、体素化、点云编码、特殊位置编码），丰富了技术路径。\n    *   **局限**：**感知仍然是被动的**。尽管输入是3D的，但观测视角通常是固定的（如固定在手腕或环境中的几个相机），模型**无法在任务执行过程中动态调整观测点位和分辨率**。这导致在长视野任务或存在严重遮挡、需要观察细微特征时，模型性能受限。\n\n#### 阶段三：主动感知驱动的VLA模型 (ActiveVLA)\n*   **代表工作**：本文提出的 **ActiveVLA**。\n*   **核心思想**：将**主动感知**理念注入VLA框架。不仅处理3D信息，更让机器人具备“主动看”的能力——根据任务上下文，动态选择最优观测视角，并对关键区域进行“放大”观察。\n*   **革命性改进**：\n    1.  **从被动接受到主动探索**：这是最根本的范式转变。模型不再是静态环境的被动观察者，而是能主动发起感知动作（移动视点、变焦）以获取信息的智能体。\n    2.  **两阶段粗到精管道**：\n        *   **粗阶段（定位）**：利用多视图2D投影和VLM主干，快速定位3D场景中的任务关键区域。\n        *   **细阶段（优化）**：\n            *   **主动视角选择**：基于关键区域，通过评分函数（权衡**可见性**、**距离**、**视角多样性**）从一组候选视点中选出最优的K个，最大化信息获取并最小化遮挡。\n            *   **主动3D变焦**：在最优视角上，通过虚拟渲染缩小视场角，实现**无几何损失的“数字变焦”**，大幅提升关键区域的像素分辨率，从而支持微米级精细操作。\n    3.  **解决核心痛点**：直接针对**遮挡**和**分辨率不足**这两个导致精细操作失败的核心问题提供了系统性解决方案。\n\n### 三、 着重发展的几个不同方向\n\n从脉络中可以看出，研究主要沿着以下几个方向深化：\n\n1.  **感知模态融合方向**：\n    *   **目标**：如何最有效地将3D几何信息与2D纹理语义信息结合。\n    *   **演进**：`2D图像` -> `3D点云/体素单独编码` -> `3D投影为多视图2D图像与VLM对齐` -> `ActiveVLA在动态选择的视图上进行融合`。趋势是寻找与强大VLM兼容且能保留丰富空间信息的表征方式。\n\n2.  **空间推理与动作表征方向**：\n    *   **目标**：如何从感知中推理出精确的6-DoF动作。\n    *   **演进**：`直接回归动作` -> `预测3D热力图/投票` -> `基于候选点排序` -> `扩散模型生成轨迹` -> `ActiveVLA的全局-局部特征融合`。趋势是动作预测越来越依赖于精细化的、基于注意力的空间概率分布。\n\n3.  **泛化与鲁棒性方向**：\n    *   **目标**：提升模型对未见过的物体、场景、指令的适应能力。\n    *   **演进**：依赖`大规模预训练数据` -> `利用3D结构不变性` -> `在仿真中引入系统扰动进行训练` -> `ActiveVLA通过主动感知应对实时遮挡和环境变化`。趋势是从数据驱动的泛化转向赋予模型主动应对不确定性的能力。\n\n4.  **感知-行动闭环方向**：\n    *   **目标**：让感知为行动服务，行动又影响感知，形成紧密闭环。\n    *   **演进**：`开环感知`（感知一次，执行到底）-> `基于固定策略的重感知` -> `ActiveVLA的闭环主动感知`。**ActiveVLA在这一方向实现了突破**，其视角选择和变焦本身就是基于当前任务状态和感知不确定性做出的决策，构成了一个内嵌的感知-规划闭环。\n\n### 四、 总结\n\n**ActiveVLA** 站在了前作（特别是BridgeVLA等3D VLA模型）的肩膀上，其核心贡献在于**首次在VLA框架中系统性地实现了主动感知**。它并非简单改进3D表征，而是引入了一个**动态的、任务驱动的感知策略**。相比于之前所有工作，它的改进在于：\n\n*   **相比于所有被动3D VLA**：解决了固定视角带来的信息不完整问题，尤其在长视野、高精度和强遮挡任务上优势明显。\n*   **相比于传统主动感知（非VLA）**：将主动感知与强大的视觉语言理解基础模型结合，使得视角选择和变焦能基于高级语义任务指令，而不仅仅是低级几何特征。\n\n因此，ActiveVLA代表了一个重要的发展方向：**使具身智能体不仅能够“理解”场景，还能学会如何“有策略地观察”场景**，这是实现其在复杂、动态真实世界中可靠操作的关键一步。论文在RLBench、COLOSSEUM、GemBench和真实机器人实验上的全面SOTA结果，强有力地验证了这一方向的价值。",

      "answer": "好的，作为一名专业的学术论文分析助手，我将为您深入分析这篇题为《ActiveVLA: Injecting Active Perception into Vision-Language-Action Models for Precise 3D Robotic Manipulation》的论文，并详细阐述其提出的关键技术方法。\n\n## 论文核心技术创新分析\n\n本文的核心贡献在于将**主动感知**能力注入到视觉-语言-动作模型中，以解决现有VLA模型因依赖静态、固定视角摄像头而导致的在长视野、细粒度操作任务中性能受限的问题。其技术框架采用**由粗到精**的两阶段范式。\n\n以下表格详细说明了其关键技术方法、数学原理和具体参数：\n\n| 技术模块 | 核心目标 | 技术细节与数学原理 | 具体参数/实现 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **1. 3D关键区域感知** | 从3D场景中定位出与任务最相关的核心区域，作为后续主动感知的焦点。 | **a. 多视角渲染：**<br>从RGB-D图像重建点云，并渲染三个正交投影视图（顶视、前视、右视）。每个视图渲染7通道图像：RGB (3通道)、深度 (1通道)、世界坐标系下的点坐标 (3通道)。坐标通道用于建立跨视图的像素对应关系。<br>渲染公式：<br>`I^(v)(u_x, u_y) = Σ_{i=1}^N c_i · δ( (u_x, u_y) - π^(v)(p_i) )`<br>其中，`π^(v)(·)` 是正交投影函数，`δ` 是狄拉克函数，颜色 `c_i` 取自投影到该像素的所有点中深度 `z_i^(v)` 最小的点，以正确处理遮挡。<br><br>**b. 关键区域提取：**<br>将渲染图像与语言指令输入预训练的VLM骨干网络（如PaliGemma）。为了从VLM的全局表征中恢复细粒度的空间注意力，引入**热图预测模块**。该模块将VLM输出的补丁令牌 `{t_i}_{i=1}^M` 根据空间位置重排为特征网格 `H_p × W_p`，然后通过一个**凸上采样块** `U(·)` 上采样至输入图像分辨率，生成热图 `H`。<br>`H = U( Rearrange( {t_i}_{i=1}^M ) )`<br>凸上采样块学习像素级权重，比固定插值方法能恢复更精细的空间细节。训练时使用交叉熵损失预测热图，最后将所有视图的热图反投影到3D空间，聚合得到关键3D区域（如目标物体的质心 `p_f ∈ R^3`）。 | - **渲染工具：** PyTorch3D。<br>- **视图数量：** 3个正交视图（顶、前、右）。<br>- **图像通道：** 7通道 (RGB + Depth + XYZ世界坐标)。<br>- **VLM骨干：** 基于PaliGemma (SigLIP编码器 + Gemma解码器)。<br>- **热图上采样：** 可学习的凸上采样块。 |\n| **2. 主动视角选择** | 在已定位的关键区域周围，动态选择最优的相机视角，以最大化信息获取、减少遮挡。 | 采用**假设检验策略**，在关键点 `p_f` 为中心的球面上生成一组候选相机位置 `C = {c_1, ..., c_M}`，并通过一个多目标评分函数选择最优的K个视角。<br><br>**a. 候选点生成：**<br>采用基于**正二十面体递归细分**的测地线采样策略，确保球面上的点分布均匀。细分k级后的总点数公式为：<br>`V(k) = 12 + 30k + (20/3)(4^k - 1)`<br><br>**b. 评分函数：**<br>每个候选位置 `c_i` 的得分 `s_i` 是以下三个标准化分数的加权和：<br>`s_i = w_vis · s_vis + w_dis · s_dis + w_div · s_div`<br>其中 `w_vis + w_dis + w_div = 1`。<br>1. **可见性分数 `s_vis`:** 判断视线 `c_i -> p_f` 是否被遮挡。沿射线均匀采样N个点 `{q_k}`，计算每个点到观测点云 `S` 的最近表面距离：`d_k = min_{s∈S} ||q_k - s||`。若所有 `d_k ≥ r` (阈值)，则 `v(c_i, p_f)=1` (无遮挡)，否则为0。<br>2. **距离分数 `s_dis`:** 偏好适中的观察距离。对 `||c_i - p_f||` 进行归一化和标准化。<br>3. **多样性分数 `s_div`:** 鼓励视角在几何上分散。计算候选 `c_i` 的观察方向向量 `v_i` 与其他所有候选方向向量的总角度差：<br>`S_div(c_i) = Σ_{j≠i} arccos(v_i · v_j)` | - **采样策略：** 正二十面体递归细分。<br>- **评分权重：** `w_vis`, `w_dis`, `w_div` (论文中未给出具体值，需调优)。<br>- **可见性阈值 `r`:** 根据点云密度设定。<br>- **选择视角数 K:** 根据图4分析，**最优值为3**。超过3个性能饱和，计算成本增加。 |\n| **3. 主动3D放大** | 在选定的最优视角上，通过虚拟渲染进行“光学变焦”，提高关键区域的图像分辨率，以支持细粒度操作。 | 在选定视角 `c_i` 上，通过缩小渲染的**视场角(FoV)** 来模拟放大效果，而不改变像素分辨率，从而在图像中赋予关键区域更多像素。<br><br>**数学原理：**<br>设原始FoV为 `α` (弧度)，放大因子为 `z > 1`，相机到兴趣区域的距离为 `d`。则渲染图像垂直于视线方向的**空间覆盖宽度** `W(z)` 为：<br>`W(z) = 2d · tan(α/(2z))`<br>随着 `z` 增大，`W(z)` 减小。**像素分辨率** `R` (像素/米) 得以保持：<br>`R = (图像宽度(像素)) / W(z)`<br>因此，放大后的图像中，兴趣区域占据了更多像素，提供了更丰富的细节。 | - **放大因子 `z`:** 根据图4分析，**最优值为4**。过大的 `z` 会损失上下文信息。<br>- **实现方式：** 在3D渲染器中直接调整虚拟相机的FoV参数。 |\n| **4. 3D动作预测** | 基于主动感知获取的优化视图，预测精确的6自由度末端执行器动作。 | **a. 平移预测：**<br>将主动选择和放大后视图的2D热图反投影到3D离散化网格 `G` 上，形成多视角得分体素：<br>`S(g) = Σ_{v=1}^3 w_v · h_v( π_v(g) )`<br>其中 `h_v` 是视图v的热图，`π_v(g)` 是网格点 `g` 在视图v上的2D投影，`w_v` 是视图权重。平移目标为：`t* = argmax_{g∈G} S(g)`。<br><br>**b. 旋转及其他动作预测：**<br>使用**层次化特征融合模块**。<br>1. **全局上下文编码：** 对每个正交投影的视觉编码器输出进行最大池化，得到捕获整体场景语义的全局令牌。<br>2. **局部上下文编码：** 使用ROI感知采样器提取局部令牌，编码细节外观和几何。<br>3. **预测：** 将所有令牌拼接后，通过一个MLP头来预测离散化的欧拉角 `(φ, θ, ψ)` (每轴72个bins)、夹爪状态 `g ∈ {0,1}` 和碰撞标志 `c ∈ {0,1}`。 | - **旋转表示：** 欧拉角，每轴离散化为**72个bins**。<br>- **特征融合：** 全局（最大池化）+ 局部（ROI采样）令牌拼接。<br>- **预测头：** MLP。 |\n\n## 总结与评价\n\n**技术创新价值：**\n1.  **范式创新：** 首次在VLA框架中系统性地集成了“**定位-选择-放大**”的主动感知闭环，将机器人感知从被动接收转变为主动探索。\n2.  **方法务实：** 提出的两项核心技术（**主动视角选择**和**主动3D放大**）均有清晰的数学建模和可操作的算法实现，不是空洞的概念。\n3.",

      "question": "论文的主要局限性有哪些？未来可能的改进方向是什么？",
      "answer": "## 论文主要局限性分析\n\n基于对论文《ActiveVLA: Injecting Active Perception into Vision-Language-Action Models for Precise 3D Robotic Manipulation》的深入分析，其核心局限性及未来改进方向如下：\n\n### 主要局限性\n\n- **计算开销与实时性**：论文指出，引入主动感知（如动态视角选择和3D放大）会增加推理时间。例如，在RLBench基准测试中，完整ActiveVLA的推理时间（0.53秒）显著高于固定视角基线（0.26秒）。这**可能限制其在需要高频控制或实时响应的动态环境中的应用**。\n\n- **对极端复杂场景的泛化能力有限**：尽管在多个基准测试中表现优异，但在最具挑战性的任务（如GemBench的L4级别任务）上，成功率仅为1.2%。这表明模型**在处理极其复杂、长视野或需要高度组合推理的任务时仍面临困难**。\n\n- **依赖仿真的3D数据与渲染**：核心的“主动3D放大”机制依赖于从点云进行高质量的多视角渲染和虚拟变焦。这**在现实世界中可能面临挑战**，例如传感器噪声、点云稀疏或不完整、以及动态物体导致的几何重建误差，可能影响变焦后视图的质量和动作预测的精度。\n\n- **主动感知策略的优化与可解释性**：视角选择和变焦策略基于一组手工设计的评分函数（可见性、距离、多样性）和权重。**这些启发式规则可能不是最优的，且缺乏从任务目标端到端学习感知策略的能力**。模型的决策过程（为何选择某个特定视角）的可解释性也有待加强。\n\n- **训练数据与计算资源需求**：模型基于大规模预训练的VLM（PaliGemma）并在多个大型仿真数据集（RLBench, COLOSSEUM, GemBench）上进行微调，**需要海量的示范数据和昂贵的GPU计算资源（如NVIDIA H100）**，这限制了其可访问性和快速迭代的可能性。\n\n### 未来可能的改进方向\n\n- **提升计算效率与实时性能**：\n    - 开发更轻量级的视角评估网络，替代耗时的基于几何的可见性计算（如KDTree搜索）。\n    - 研究模型蒸馏或架构搜索技术，在保持性能的同时减少VLM主干网络的计算量。\n    - 实现**异步感知-动作管道**，让主动感知模块在机器人执行当前动作时并行规划下一个最佳视角。\n\n- **增强对复杂与未知任务的泛化**：\n    - 结合**世界模型或动力学模型**进行更长远的前瞻性规划，以应对长视野任务。\n    - 引入**元学习或在线适应机制**，使机器人能在少量新任务示范或交互中快速调整其感知策略。\n    - 探索**基于LLM/VLM的零样本任务分解与规划**，将复杂指令自动分解为模型已掌握的动作基元序列。\n\n- **改进现实世界的鲁棒性**：\n    - 开发对**不完美点云和传感器噪声更具鲁棒性的3D表示与渲染方法**，例如使用神经辐射场（NeRF）或3D高斯溅射进行更逼真的视图合成。\n    - 在更大量且多样化的**真实机器人数据**上进行训练或域适应，以缩小仿真到现实的差距。\n    - 研究**多模态融合**（如结合触觉反馈），在视觉严重遮挡时提供补充信息。\n\n- **优化与学习主动感知策略**：\n    - 用**强化学习或基于梯度的学习方法**替代手工设计的评分函数，端到端地学习视角选择策略，以直接最大化任务成功率。\n    - 引入**信息论目标**（如最大化互信息、减少不确定性），让主动感知更直接地服务于减少状态估计的不确定性。\n    - 提高模型的**可解释性**，例如通过注意力可视化或生成自然语言解释，说明为何选择某个视角或变焦区域。\n\n- **降低数据与训练门槛**：\n    - 研究更高效的**数据利用方法**，如基于模型的增强、示范数据重放或从互联网视频中学习。\n    - 探索**参数高效的微调技术**（如LoRA），在适应新任务时仅更新少量参数，减少对计算资源的需求。\n    - 构建**开源、标准化的仿真与真实数据集**，促进社区共同改进。\n\n**总结**：ActiveVLA的核心创新在于将**主动感知**机制注入VLA模型，显著提升了在遮挡和精细操作任务上的性能。其当前局限性主要体现在**计算效率、对极端复杂任务的泛化、以及仿真到现实的迁移**上。未来的工作将围绕**算法效率、策略学习、多模态融合和降低数据依赖**等方向展开，以推动其走向更实用、更通用的机器人智能体。",
