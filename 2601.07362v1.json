Between 2010 and 2022, volcanic eruptions took the lives of more than a thousand people\n[\n11\n]\n.\nScientists have been focusing on protecting affected populations through monitoring and analysis that enable timely warnings and evacuation.\nMonitoring is often conducted through the deployment of sensor networks that track ground deformation, seismic activity, and volcanic gas emissions. Eruptions are often preceded by changes in these signals on timescales from years to minutes, enabling forecasts of eruption timing\n[\n1\n]\n.\nThese signals can be acquired remotely or in situ, where these different data collection schemes are complementary to each other\n[\n1\n]\n.\nThis work focuses on autonomous in situ gas measurements, which enable the real-time estimation of volatile concentration and composition relevant to magmatic processes\n[\n6\n,\n7\n]\n.\nConducting in situ gas measurements requires bringing instruments to fumaroles – small openings and fractures that emit volcanic gases and steam and typically cluster near active vents. As a consequence, these sites are often hazardous due to unstable terrain, toxic gases (e.g.,\nSO\n2\n\\text{SO}{\\vphantom{\\text{X}}}_{\\smash[t]{\\text{2}}}\n,\nH\n2\n​\nS\n\\text{H}{\\vphantom{\\text{X}}}_{\\smash[t]{\\text{2}}}\\text{S}\n), and sudden explosive phreatic or pyroclastic eruptions, making human-assisted sampling particularly dangerous. Mobile robotic systems enable event-driven sampling in demanding and evolving volcanic environments. They can simultaneously acquire gas, thermal, and topographic data, providing essential context for interpretation\n[\n9\n,\n10\n,\n17\n]\n. Mobility offers four key advantages: (i)\nadaptability\nin a highly dynamic environment: fixed sensors can be destroyed by eruptions, overrun by lava or buried by tephra, or become irrelevant when degassing migrates, whereas a robot can reposition, search for new fumaroles, and track a shifting plume; (ii)\nevent-driven sampling\n: the system can be dispatched rapidly to emergent activity (e.g., sudden degassing or eruptive phases) without redeploying personnel; (iii)\ncontextual sensing\n: robots can co-acquire gas data with visual/spectral imagery, thermal measurements, and LiDAR-based topography, providing essential spatial and temporal context for interpreting fluxes and composition; and (iv)\nspatial coverage\n: a mobile sensor can survey large areas with a single instrument, making it feasible to deploy expensive, high-performance devices.\nPrior work has leveraged unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for plume sampling\n[\n10\n,\n9\n,\n20\n]\n. UAVs are effective for vent-level plumes because they can approach vent airspace while maintaining a safe standoff. Near-surface degassing, however, occurs at fumaroles distributed across the volcano with variable flux and composition (one example shown in Figure\n6\n). Rapid dilution means that accurate sampling requires proximity to the source\n[\n6\n]\n, which is particularly challenging for UAVs in complex terrain and unstable winds.\nDifferent research groups have developed specialized unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) to address the challenges of source-proximal plume measurements\n[\n17\n,\n3\n]\n.\nHowever, this also introduces locomotion and terrain hazards, such as loose tephra, steep slopes, lava ridges, and boulder fields\n[\n17\n]\n.\nCurrent wheeled and wheeled-legged rovers for volcanic monitoring have limited adaptability to uneven ground, compromising their stability. To protect sensitive instruments and avoid rollover, they must move slowly, which reduces operational efficiency and limits their practicality as in situ measurement platforms. Additionally, although several robotic systems have been developed for volcanic gas measurement, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, none have conducted successful in situ measurements on an active volcano. The primary obstacle lies in the inaccessibility of fumaroles, which demand advanced locomotion capabilities and sufficient efficiency to reach remote sites.\nMoreover, current ground systems are primarily teleoperated; however, radio links can become intermittent during eruptions or in rugged terrain, making continuous teleoperation impractical and motivating the development of autonomous mission capabilities\n[\n22\n]\n.\nIn recent years, legged robots have emerged as a new class of ground platforms capable of traversing diverse terrains. Their feasibility for in-the-wild applications has been demonstrated in missions ranging from teleoperated to partially autonomous operation.\nTeleoperated deployments are common in wildlife observation\n[\n14\n]\nor soil sampling\n[\n24\n]\n, whereas some initial approaches use partial autonomy, e.g., for planetary analog exploration\n[\n2\n]\nor forest inventory\n[\n12\n]\n. In many systems, the mission design remains human-in-the-loop: an operator specifies dense goals, such as a set of waypoints or a route, which defines sampling locations. The robot then navigates along these goals with local obstacle avoidance under safety supervision\n[\n2\n,\n12\n,\n24\n]\n.\nFigure 1:\nOverview of the robotic system equipped with the gas-sensing payload and perception sensors.\n(a) Robot with labeled sensor components.\n(b) Gas-sensing payload with rollcage.\n(c) Transpector\n®\nMPH quadrupole mass spectrometer subsystem.\nIn this article, we present a legged robotic system for autonomous volcanic gas monitoring that integrates a mobile mass spectrometer with a high-level autonomy stack.\nWe describe the hardware and software integration of the mass spectrometer, enabling precise in situ gas analysis during field operation.\nWe introduce the methods developed for\nterrain-aware\nnavigation in extreme outdoor environments, allowing extended autonomous missions with minimal operator input.\nThe proposed approach is validated through three autonomous field missions on Mount Etna, representing the first successful volcanic gas measurements performed by a ground robot in an active volcanic area.\nWe further discuss key lessons learned from these real-world deployments, highlighting practical challenges and their implications for future autonomous systems for gas sensing and long-range navigation in natural environments.\nUltimately, this work aims to support volcanologists in both regular and event-driven monitoring of active areas by enabling source-proximal gas measurements beyond the reach of human operators.\nThe rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section\nII\ndescribes the hardware and software architecture with its components. Section\nIII\npresents the three autonomous missions we conducted at Mount Etna, while Section\nIV\nshows the results of the plume measurements we conducted. We discuss lessons learned in Section\nV\nand draw a conclusion in Section\nVI\n.\nII\nSYSTEM DESCRIPTION\nII-A\nRobotic Platform\nOur robotic system consists of two parts, namely, the locomotion platform ANYmal, an off-the-shelf quadruped produced by ANYbotics AG, and a gas-sensing payload.\nEach leg of the ANYmal has three actuated joints, enabling hip abduction/adduction, hip flexion/extension, and knee flexion/extension. The robot weighs\n50\nkg\n50\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{kg}\nand has a payload capacity of\n12\nkg\n12\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{kg}\n. It is powered by a\n907\nW\nh\n907\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{W}\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{h}\nlithium-ion battery and has, at maximum payload, a runtime of about\n1\nh\n1\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{h}\n.\nAs shown in Figure\n1\na, the robot is equipped with various sensors. It has six RealSense D435i depth cameras for close-range depth perception and a Velodyne VLP-16 LiDAR for long-range distance measurements, complemented by an IMU.\nThe robot is further equipped with two wide-angle FLIR Blackfly RGB cameras. Additionally, we integrate a TIER IV C1 camera with a 198° field of view and High Dynamic Range (HDR) capabilities for enhanced visibility under variable lighting conditions.\nMoreover, the robot is equipped with a\nGlobal Navigation Satellite System\n(\nGNSS\n) receiver, specifically a Swift Navigation Piksi Multi, operating without Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) corrections.\nThe onboard computation is handled by two internal Intel Core i7 processors, complemented by an NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX for additional GPU-accelerated processing, used, for example, in the Elevation Mapping module, explained in Section\nII-C\n3\n.\nFigure 2:\nOverview of software architecture.\nThe architecture is organized into two main parts: the\nblue\nnavigation modules, responsible for global and local path planning and locomotion control, and the\ngreen\nperception modules, which handle state estimation and elevation mapping.\nInformation flows from high-level mission planning (top left) to low-level actuation (bottom left), while feedback from perception enables autonomous operation and live supervision of mapping and gas measurements.\nThe numbers in\npink\ncorrespond to the sections of this paper in which the respective modules are described.\nII-B\nScientific Gas-Sensing Payload\nTo analyze volcanic gases in situ, the sensing system must provide precise, selective, and robust measurements under harsh environmental conditions.\nConventional approaches typically employ non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) sensors (e.g., for\nCO\n2\n\\text{CO}{\\vphantom{\\text{X}}}_{\\smash[t]{\\text{2}}}\n,\nCO\n,\nH\n2\n​\nO\n\\text{H}{\\vphantom{\\text{X}}}_{\\smash[t]{\\text{2}}}\\text{O}\n), electrochemical sensors (e.g., for\nSO\n2\n\\text{SO}{\\vphantom{\\text{X}}}_{\\smash[t]{\\text{2}}}\n,\nH\n2\n​\nS\n\\text{H}{\\vphantom{\\text{X}}}_{\\smash[t]{\\text{2}}}\\text{S}\n,\nHCl\n,\nHF\n), and semiconductor sensors (e.g., for\nH\n2\n\\text{H}{\\vphantom{\\text{X}}}_{\\smash[t]{\\text{2}}}\n)\n[\n6\n]\n.\nWhile effective for targeted gas components, these sensors have a limited dynamic range, are prone to cross-sensitivity and degradation in acidic volcanic environments\n[\n6\n]\n.\nTo address these limitations, we employ a compact mass spectrometer as the primary sensing instrument, which has been previously validated in volcanic environments\n[\n8\n]\n.\nThis analytical instrument identifies compounds based on their mass-to-charge ratio, providing high selectivity and accuracy across a wide range of gas components\n[\n7\n]\n.\nIn practice, it can resolve characteristic atomic mass units (amu) of various compounds, such as Hydrogen (\nH\n2\n\\text{H}{\\vphantom{\\text{X}}}_{\\smash[t]{\\text{2}}}\n, 2 amu), Helium (\nHe\n, 4 amu), Carbon Dioxide (\nCO\n2\n\\text{CO}{\\vphantom{\\text{X}}}_{\\smash[t]{\\text{2}}}\n, 44 amu), and Sulfur Dioxide (\nSO\n2\n\\text{SO}{\\vphantom{\\text{X}}}_{\\smash[t]{\\text{2}}}\n, 64 amu), along with many other gases, isotopes, and molecular fragments.\nMoreover, its six-order-of-magnitude dynamic range prevents saturation at high concentrations, enabling reliable measurements both within dense fumarolic plumes and in downwind regions with sub-ppm (parts per million) concentrations.\nThe instrument we employ is an INFICON Transpector\n®\nMPH quadrupole mass spectrometer.\nTo operate, it requires a high-vacuum environment, which is provided by a compact two-stage pumping setup consisting of a miniature diaphragm pump and a very small turbomolecular pump (Figure\n1\nc).\nAmbient air enters the system through a stainless-steel capillary with a fixed flow restriction, which controls the gas flow into the measurement chamber.\nThe diaphragm pump first lowers the pressure from atmospheric conditions to the medium-vacuum range (\n1\n×\n10\n−\n3\nbar\n1\\text{\\times}{10}^{-3}\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{b}\\mathrm{a}\\mathrm{r}\n), after which the turbomolecular pump further reduces it to approximately\n1\n×\n10\n−\n7\nbar\n1\\text{\\times}{10}^{-7}\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{b}\\mathrm{a}\\mathrm{r}\n.\nAt this pressure, the incoming gas is ionized by an electron beam, and the resulting ions are separated by their mass-to-charge ratio in the quadrupole analyzer, producing a spectrum that reveals the gas composition.\nThe used sensor has a mass range of\n1\n−\n200\namu\n1-200\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{a}\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{u}\nwith a detection limit of\n<\n1\nppm\n<1\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{ppm}\nin controlled environments and an acquisition time of\n1.8\nms\n1.8\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{ms}\nper mass data point.\nThe response time is approximately\n3\ns\n3\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{s}\n, primarily determined by the inlet system, which consists of a\n1\nm\n1\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{m}\ncapillary that reduces the difference between atmospheric and vacuum pressure levels.\nThe complete mass spectrometer subsystem weighs\n8.7\nkg\n8.7\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{kg}\n.\nAs shown in Figure\n1\nb, we constructed an aluminium rollcage weighing approximately\n3\nkg\n3\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{kg}\nto protect the instrument from fall damage.\nThe mass spectrometer is powered through the robot’s output port, with an average power consumption of\n36\nW\n36\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{W}\n, and communicates via TCP/IP through its native API.\nII-C\nSoftware Architecture\nThe software architecture, shown in Figure\n2\n, follows a modular design structured into two main categories.\nBlue\ndenotes the navigation modules, responsible for global and local path planning and for executing velocity commands through the locomotion controller.\nGreen\nindicates the perception modules, which process data from multiple onboard sensors to perform state estimation and elevation mapping.\nTogether, these components enable the hierarchical planning and control pipeline described below, which orchestrates the robot’s autonomous behavior from high-level mission specification down to low-level actuation.\nAt the highest level, a\nMission Planning\nGraphical User Interface\n(\nGUI\n) allows the\nOperator\nto define mission\ntargets\n, which serve as targets for the\nGlobal Planner\nto generate a global\npath\n.\nSince this path is represented in geographic coordinates (longitude, latitude, and altitude), it is transformed into the robot’s local reference frame through sensor fusion of global\nGNSS\ndata with point-cloud\nSimultaneous Localization and Mapping\n(\nSLAM\n) and kinematic measurements.\nFrom the transformed\npath\n, a\nlookahead waypoint\nis sampled and passed to the\nLocal Planner\n.\nThe\nLocal Planner\nthen computes a feasible local trajectory toward the\nlookahead waypoint\nbased on the height and traversability information provided by the\nElevation Mapping\nmodule.\nFinally, the resulting base velocity commands are executed by a\nreinforcement-learning\n(\nRL\n)\nLocomotion\ncontroller that drives the individual leg actuators to achieve the desired body motion.\nDuring the mission, the operator can monitor the system through the\nMission Supervision\ninterface, which provides access to the assembled SLAM map, live camera feeds, and real-time gas measurement data.\nII-C\n1\nMission Planning\nThe mission planning\nGUI\ndisplays globally referenced satellite data in longitude-latitude coordinates, enabling intuitive image-based target selection.\nThe purpose of the image is to provide the operator with sufficient environmental context for planning, ideally based on high-resolution satellite imagery.\nSince this data is not universally available, we base the visualization on the Tracestrack Topo layer of OpenStreetMap\n1\n1\n1\nhttps://www.openstreetmap.org/#layers=P\n, which includes path networks, types, and dense contour lines that allow recognizing topographic features such as craters.\nThe data are retrieved via the OpenStreetMap API, and an example is shown in Figure\n2\n(\nGlobal Planner\n).\nFor deployments where this visualization is insufficient, the interface also allows importing aerial imagery captured by a drone as a substitute for high-resolution satellite data.\nGlobal missions are planned interactively by placing targets on the\nGUI\naccording to the mission objectives.\nThe global planner then interpolates a path between these targets.\nSpecifically, we employ an A* planner operating on a road network graph generated offline using the OpenStreetMap Python wrapper OSMnx\n[\n4\n]\n, visualized in\nblue\nin Figure\n2\n(\nGlobal Planner\n).\nTargets located outside the graph are linearly connected to their nearest projection point.\nThe A* cost between two connected nodes is defined as the Euclidean distance. Although slope and surface characteristics naturally influence traversal cost, publicly available digital elevation models have coarse resolutions (\n10\n−\n30\nm\n10-30\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{m}\n), making it difficult to estimate these factors a priori.\nAs shown in Figure\n2\n, the mission planning\nGUI\nis operated directly by the user and outputs a global path in longitude-latitude-altitude coordinates, which is transformed into the Cartesian robot frame based on the state estimation described in the following section.\nII-C\n2\nState Estimation\nAccurate state estimation, including a reliable world-referenced robot pose, is a prerequisite for executing long-range and large-scale navigation tasks.\nWe build on the optimization-based multi-sensor fusion framework\nHolistic Fusion\n(\nHF\n)\n[\n18\n]\nand adapt it to better handle the challenges of long-range deployments, such as numerical ill-conditioning, intermittent and sometimes unreliable\nGNSS\n, and inconsistent estimates that drift over time.\nIt fuses three complementary sources:\ni)\nglobally referenced but noisy non-RTK\nGNSS\nmeasurements,\nii)\nglobally consistent but drifting\nLight Detection and Ranging\n(\nLiDAR\n)-SLAM poses, and\niii)\nshort-term stable inertial-kinematic odometry from ANYbotics’ internal kinematic-inertial estimator.\nFor\nLiDAR\n-SLAM poses, we employ the field-tested degeneracy-aware X-ICP\n[\n21\n]\nLiDAR\n-based SLAM framework. This module provides smooth, temporally consistent\nSE\n​\n(\n3\n)\n\\mathrm{SE}(3)\npose estimates (i.e., full 6-DoF position and orientation) of the robot within the evolving\nLiDAR\nmap.\nWhile\nLiDAR\n-SLAM solutions are designed for temporally consistent performance, their accuracy ultimately depends on the quality of the incoming\nLiDAR\ndata. Under nominal conditions, the sensor provides sufficient geometric structure for reliable scan matching. In environments with loose soil, however, foot slip induces high dynamics in the robot, which in turn introduces motion distortions into the\nLiDAR\nobservations. Combined with the already sparse geometric structure typical of volcanic terrain, these distortions can cause\nLiDAR\n-SLAM to drift over long distances.\nTherefore, in order to achieve globally consistent localization, the\nLiDAR\n-SLAM estimates must be fused with\nGNSS\nsignals.\nThe resulting estimator remains stable during\nGNSS\noutages, and quickly re-anchors to the global frame once absolute information is restored.\nHF\nformulates estimation as a factor-graph\nMaximum a Posteriori\n(\nMAP\n)

couple local mapping with the global reference frame.\nWe make two central design choices in order to enhance\nHF\nand make it more robust for long-distance deployment.\nFirst, instead of treating the\nLiDAR\n-SLAM output as incremental odometry, we introduce\nabsolute\nLiDAR\n-SLAM pose factors into the graph.\nSecond, we explicitly estimate the alignment between the evolving\nLiDAR\n-SLAM map and the world frame as part of the optimization.\nConcretely, the alignment state in\n𝒳\nN\nR\nR\n{}^{R}\\mathcal{X}_{N_{R}}\nat time\nk\nk\nbetween the world frame\n𝚆\n\\mathtt{W}\nand the Open3D map

the global estimate on the fly, enabling the fusion to (a) maintain smooth, globally consistent trajectories across\nGNSS\ndropouts, (b) query the robot state directly in the map frame at any time, and (c) model uncertainty growth according to the assumed drift characteristics of the mapping back end (rather than just local registration noise).\nTogether, the degeneracy-aware\nLiDAR\nSLAM and the alignment-aware\nHF\nfusion yield accurate global localization and reliable local consistency across long, geometry-poor traverses.\nFigure\n2\nillustrates how the\nState Estimation\nmodule interfaces with the navigation stack.\nIts main task is to localize the robot in the world frame\n𝚆\n\\mathtt{W}\nand provide a transform to the global path, defined in the geographic frame\n𝙻𝙻𝙰\n\\mathtt{LLA}\n, into a local Cartesian representation usable by the\nLocal Planner\n.\nFor this, we construct a Cartesian East-North-Up (\n𝙴𝙽𝚄\n\\mathtt{ENU}\n) frame anchored at the robot’s initial geographic position, and compute\n𝙻𝙻𝙰\n→\n𝙴𝙽𝚄\n\\mathtt{LLA}\\!\\to\\!\\mathtt{ENU}\non the WGS-84 ellipsoid.\nWe additionally employ a geoid undulation model (EGM2008) to convert the ellipsoidal heights to orthometric heights referenced to mean sea level, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the transformation.\nThe global Cartesian frame\n𝙴𝙽𝚄\n\\mathtt{ENU}\nhas a fixed transform to the earlier introduced world frame\n𝚆\n\\mathtt{W}\n, ensuring consistent alignment between global coordinates and local navigation tasks.\nII-C\n3\nElevation Mapping and Traversability Estimation\nNavigating in unstructured environments requires a reliable spatial representation of the surrounding terrain.\n2.5D elevation maps provide a memory-efficient solution for ground robots, supporting multimodal sensor fusion and compatibility with various downstream tasks.\nIn this representation, each grid cell encodes the local terrain height, and additional layers can store complementary information such as traversability.\nSuch maps are essential for both perceptive locomotion, by identifying safe foothold regions, and navigation planning, by enabling the computation of feasible paths that avoid high-risk areas.\nWe employ\nElevation Mapping CuPy\n[\n16\n]\n, an elevation mapping framework accelerated on the GPU for fast and efficient fusion of multi-modal sensory inputs.\nAs shown in Figure\n2\n, it integrates depth data from six RGB-D cameras with measurements from the LiDAR to construct an ego-centric elevation map of size\n12\nm\n12\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{m}\n×\n\\times\n12\nm\n12\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{m}\nat a resolution of\n0.06\nm\n0.06\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{m}\n.\nFor geometric traversability estimation, we follow the approach of\n[\n23\n]\nand use a lightweight convolutional neural network trained on a small set of manually annotated terrain samples to predict a traversability score between 0 and 1.\nTo improve the spatial consistency of the predictions and increase safety margins in rough terrain, we further refine the traversability layer through\ninpainting\nand\ndilation\noperations with a kernel size of\n0.24\nm\n0.24\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{m}\n.\nExamples of the resulting maps are shown in Figure\n2\n(\nElevation Mapping\n).\nThe two generated layers,\nHeight\nand\nTraversability\n, are subsequently used by the\nLocal Planner\n, described in the following section.\nII-C\n4\nLocal Navigation\nWhile the global planner computes a feasible high-level path, local uncertainties, such as\nGNSS\ndrift or previously unseen obstacles, increase the demand for a reactive local planner to follow this path safely.\nSince local planners optimize paths primarily within the robot’s field of view, we introduce an intermediate\nlookahead waypoint\n,\nvisualised\nin Figure\n2\n(\nPath Manager\n), which is updated at\n0.5\nHz\n0.5\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{Hz}\n, to guide the robot along the global path.\nThe choice of lookahead distance critically influences how well the robot anticipates upcoming path geometry: if it is too large, especially around corners, the robot may deviate prematurely and enter local minima; if it is too small, the robot becomes overly sensitive to minor irregularities of the global path, such as local artifacts or offsets.\nTo balance these effects, we dynamically adjust the lookahead distance according to the curvature of the global path: using a longer lookahead in straight, open areas to ensure stability, and a shorter lookahead in tight turns to maintain adherence to the intended route.\nThe path curvature at the robot’s current position is obtained through the calculation outlined below and visualized in Figure\n3\n.\nWe first project the robot’s position\n𝐱\nr\n​\no\n​\nb\n​\no\n​\nt\n\\mathbf{x}_{robot}\nonto the path to obtain the closest anchor point\n𝐱\ni\n\\mathbf{x}_{i}\nat index\ni\ni\n.\nTwo secant

arc-length distance from the anchor. This places stronger emphasis on the nearby path geometry while accounting for the structure of the upcoming trajectory. Figure\n3\nillustrates two examples of this procedure.\nTo follow this lookahead waypoint, we employ the\nField Local Planner\nintroduced by\n[\n13\n]\n, which combines multiple vector fields using Riemannian Motion Policies (RMPs) for continuous obstacle avoidance and goal attraction.\nFor obstacle avoidance, a Signed Distance Field (SDF) is used, which generates a repulsive field that drives the robot away from obstacles.\nIt is constructed from the traversability map by thresholding it at\n0.2\n0.2\nto mark obstacles, followed by computing and normalizing the Euclidean distance of each cell to the nearest obstacle.\nThe goal attraction is implemented as a Geodesic Distance Field (GDF), which produces an attractive field that guides the local planner toward the goal.\nIt is defined as a smooth scalar field over the traversable region, where each cell encodes the shortest-cost distance to the goal such that gradient descent over the field yields efficient local trajectories.\nExamples of both fields are shown in Figure\n2\n(\nLocal Planner\n).\nFigure 3:\nComputation of curvature-based adaptive lookahead.\nThe robot’s position

component of the autonomy framework, ensuring that high-level planning and sensing objectives can be executed reliably in rough volcanic terrain.\nOur\nRL\n-based controller receives base velocity commands from the\nLocal Planner\nand integrates elevation-map information for perceptive locomotion, generating coordinated leg motions that maintain stability and energy efficiency on uneven terrain.Following the methodology of\n[\n15\n]\n, the controller is trained entirely in simulation using a teacher-student distillation pipeline to enhance robustness in unstructured environments.\nA\nteacher\npolicy is first trained with access to privileged information such as ground-truth terrain friction, additional payload mass, and external forces.\nSubsequently, a\nstudent\npolicy learns to mimic the teacher’s behavior without access to these privileged inputs.\nThis setup encourages the student to implicitly estimate hidden physical parameters, yielding strong adaptability to variations in terrain and robot dynamics, such as changes in base mass or contact properties.\nWhile a general policy trained with standard domain randomization can tolerate moderate payload changes, it exhibits less efficient gaits under significantly increased weight and shifted center of mass.\nTo improve stability and efficiency, we trained an extended policy using payload-specific domain randomization.\nDuring training, the simulated robot’s base mass was augmented to include the payload, and its center of mass was randomly varied within a plausible range to account for the uncertainty of the real instrument and rollcage.\nThis payload information was provided to the teacher policy as a privileged input, enabling it to develop locomotion strategies specifically adapted to the altered dynamics.\nThe resulting student policy retained this robustness while remaining fully deployable without privileged sensing.\nIn practice, this approach produced a stable, terrain-adaptive gait that maintained reliable performance throughout the field campaign.\nAlthough the learned policy supports walking speeds of up to\n1.5\nm\ns\n−\n1\n1.5\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{m}\\text{\\,}{\\mathrm{s}}^{-1}\nand slope climbing up to\n25\n°\n25\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{\\SIUnitSymbolDegree}\n, a conservative limit of\n0.8\nm\ns\n−\n1\n0.8\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{m}\\text{\\,}{\\mathrm{s}}^{-1}\nwas imposed during field operation for safety.\nII-C\n6\nGas Sensing and Data Processing\nWe developed a dedicated ROS package to interface directly with the mass spectrometer via its native API, enabling full control and real-time data acquisition on board the robot.\nThe instrument\nsupports two\nmeasurement modes: a\nbin\nscan, which repeatedly measures a predefined set of selected atomic mass values (e.g., [2, 4, 8, 44] amu), and an\nanalog\nscan, which continuously records spectra over a specified range (e.g., 1-50\namu\n).\nWe employ the\nbin\nmode for its higher sampling rate, which enables temporal mapping of gas concentrations during motion.\nThrough the ROS integration, all spectrometer measurements are automatically time-synchronized with the robot.\nThis allows each gas sample to be globally and locally referenced, and visualized in the mission planning interface as colored markers along the robot’s trajectory (Figure\n4\nGas\n).\nThe concentration levels are also plotted in real-time, providing the operator with immediate feedback for situational awareness and plume analysis.\nIII\nAUTONOMOUS MISSIONS\nTABLE I:\nPerformance metrics for three autonomous missions.\nLength\nDuration\nGas sources detected\nInterventions\nTotal intervention

(d-g) Representative images illustrating the robot’s operation in varying terrain conditions.\nIII-A\nTesting Setup\nTo evaluate the performance of the proposed system, field experiments were conducted on Mount Etna, Sicily, Italy.\nMount Etna is one of the most active volcanoes in the world, offering diverse terrains that range from solidified lava flows to loose volcanic deserts.\nIts frequent degassing activity and well-developed road network enable safe yet realistic testing of robotic systems in a volcanic environment.\nSeveral potential test sites were assessed on the mountain, prioritizing locations with a high likelihood of degassing activity.\nThe main craters were excluded because they required a\n2.5\nkm\n2.5\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{km}\nhike with an altitude gain of about\n400\nm\n400\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{m}\nfrom the nearest parking area, making access logistically infeasible.\nThe next accessible location, the Barbagallo craters, was also unsuitable due to heavy tourist activity along a narrow path, which posed safety risks.\nOf the remaining accessible sites, the one where we observed active degassing during our campaign was the Laghetto crater, reachable via an unpaved road followed by a short walk and a steep ascent.\nHowever, the path leading to the fumaroles was narrow, steep, and covered in loose sand, as shown in Figure\n6\n.\nGiven these challenging conditions, the corresponding gas-measurement mission was conducted in teleoperated mode to ensure safety, with results discussed in Section\nIV\n.\nThe autonomy tests were instead performed at locations that provided safe conditions for autonomous navigation, where artificial gas sources were deployed to evaluate sensing performance.\nWe designed three representative scenarios that reflect typical challenges for autonomous operation on a volcano, distributed across different regions of Mount Etna, as shown in the region overview in Figure\nLABEL:fig:conceptual_scenario\n.\nMission 1 (Figure\n4\n-M1) followed the rim of the Silvestri crater, featuring a long traverse with few visual landmarks for localization.\nMission 2 (Figure\n4\n-M2) descended into the same crater, posing locomotion challenges due to steep slopes and a floor covered in rocks of different sizes.\nMission 3 (Figure\n4\n-M3) took place in a volcanic desert near the Laghetto crater, where fine sand and degraded\nGNSS\nreception made both locomotion and localization difficult.\nNavigation was further challenged by numerous rocks, irregular and loose terrain with slopes, and visually uniform but mechanically inconsistent sand, which made traversability difficult to predict during planning.\nDuring operation, data were streamed to the operator’s computer for monitoring (Figure\n2\nMission Supervision\n), while the operator remained at a safe distance to allow for safety-critical intervention.\nTo demonstrate the gas-sensing capability in a controlled yet representative way, we placed helium bottles along the planned trajectories.\nHelium was selected because it is non-toxic, non-flammable, chemically inert, poses no environmental risk, and is easily detectable due to its negligible natural background concentration in the atmosphere.\nResults of the autonomous missions are presented below.\nIII-B\nAutonomous Mission Results\nThe three autonomous missions were analyzed with respect to both gas-sensing performance and autonomous navigation reliability.\nTable\nI\nsummarizes the deployment results.\nTwo categories of performance measures were considered.\nFirst, gas-source detection was assessed by verifying, through post-mission analysis, whether the deployed sources were successfully identified in the recorded concentration data.\nSecond, autonomy was quantified using two complementary metrics.\nThe Robot Attention Demand (\nR\n​\nA\n​\nD\nRAD\n)\n[\n19\n]\nwas computed as\nR\n​\nA\n​\nD\n=\nI\n​\nE\nI\n​\nE\n+\nN\n​\nT\n,\nRAD=\\frac{IE}{IE+NT},\n(5)\nwhere the interaction effort (\nI\n​\nE\nIE\n) denotes the average duration of operator interventions and the neglect tolerance (\nN\n​\nT\nNT\n) represents the time intervals between them.\nThe Autonomy Rate (\nA\n​\nR\nAR\n) expresses the fraction of the total mission time during which the robot operated without human input, calculated as\nA\n​\nR\n=\n100\n×\n(\n1\n−\nT\nintervention\nT\ntotal\n)\n.\nAR=100\\times\\left(1-\\frac{T_{\\text{intervention}}}{T_{\\text{total}}}\\right).\n(6)\nAll three missions were completed successfully, achieving RAD values below 0.1 and autonomy rates above 90%.\nMission 2 was executed entirely autonomously, requiring no operator intervention, whereas Missions 1 and 3 involved short interventions to ensure equipment safety.\nThe gas-source detection performance was affected by environmental conditions, resulting in five successful detections out of the eight deployed sources.\nIn particular, average winds of\n5\nkm\nh\n−\n1\n5\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{km}\\text{\\,}{\\mathrm{h}}^{-1}\nand gusts up to\n39\nkm\nh\n−\n1\n39\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{km}\\text{\\,}{\\mathrm{h}}^{-1}\n, according to meteorological reports for the test days, led to plume dispersion and increased sensitivity to source placement.\nMission 1 – Crater Rim:\nThe first experiment was conducted along the rim of the Silvestri crater.\nAs shown in Figure\n4\n(M1d-M1g), the path had low-gradient slopes at the edges and several larger boulders distributed along the route (M1d, M1f).\nFigure\n4\n(M1b) shows the full trajectory projected onto a high-resolution mesh that we independently recorded using a Leica Geosystems RTC360 stationary scanner for visualization purposes.\nThe corresponding time series is presented in Figure\n4\n(M1c).\nOut of the five helium sources deployed, the robot detected three at the correct locations, visible as clear peaks in the recorded signal. Due to the wind along the crater rim, the remaining two sources were not detected, as the gas plumes were blown away from the robot.\nFor the identified detections, the time series in Figure\n4\n(M1c) shows a steep rising edge and a slower decay, which is typical for mass spectrometers due to residual gas remaining in the vacuum chamber after exposure.\nFour operator interventions were required during this mission, as indicated in Figure\n4\n(M1e-M1g).\nOne occurred when the local planner overestimated the space between two obstacles (M1f), two were caused by incorrect traversability estimation on fine ash (M1e), and one happened when the robot took a wrong turn toward unsafe terrain (M1g) due to subtle misalignment of the robot heading in the world frame.\nThese interventions occurred in sections where the transformed global path deviated several meters from the real trail, as illustrated in two examples in Figure\n5\n.\nThe offset was caused by a combination of two factors.\nFirst, the limited positional accuracy of the OpenStreetMap data used for global path generation resulted in the planned path being shifted relative to its actual location.\nSecond, the terrain of the crater rim contains weakly structured areas, in which point-cloud SLAM intermittently drifted since scan matching became poorly constrained and small registration errors accumulated.\nThis effect was further amplified by GNSS position uncertainty of approximately\n±\n2\n−\n3\nm\n\\pm$2-3\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{m}$\n.\nBecause global orientation observability relies on both reliable SLAM geometry and an accurate GNSS position anchor, the simultaneous degradation of these two sources caused the fusion system to misinterpret small positional inconsistencies as changes in orientation, producing a rotational offset in the projected global path.\nAs a result of these two factors, the lookahead waypoints were physically unreachable, leading the local planner to generate commands that steered the robot into local minima or low-traversability regions.\nFigure 5:\nExample of global-local path misalignment during an autonomous mission.\n(a,b) Mission GUI showing the\nglobal path\n, the traversable trail (\nblue\nregions in the elevation map), and the robot’s\npast trajectory\n.\n(c,d) Corresponding camera view of the same scenes.\nMission 2 – Crater Descent:\nThe second experiment started from approximately the same location as Mission 1, but this time the robot descended into the crater and returned to the rim, as shown in Figure\n4\n(M2b).\nThe path was moderately steep with partially loose ground, and the crater floor consisted of a boulder field with small to medium-sized rocks (Figure\n4\n(M2f)), both posing notable locomotion challenges.\nThe robot successfully descended into and exited the crater without any human intervention.\nThe executed trajectory is shown in Figure\n4\n(M2a).\nAs expected, the main challenge arose from the rocks on the crater floor.\nThe elevation map struggled to capture these smaller obstacles, so the perceptive controller could not account for them.\nConsequently, the robot occasionally stepped on loose rocks that shifted under its weight, but the locomotion controller proved sufficiently robust to recover.\nA single helium source was placed at the center of the crater.\nTo illustrate a case where gas measurements are taken only in regions of expected degassing, the mass spectrometer was only activated once the target area was reached. The resulting gas concentrations measured during the exit from the crater are shown in the concentration map in Figure\n4\n(M2b).\nThe time series data in Figure\n4\n(M2c) show a clear concentration peak, indicating that the robot successfully detected the gas source.\nMission 3 – Volcanic Desert:\nFor this experiment, the robot traversed a volcanic desert near the Laghetto crater.\nAs shown in Figure\n4\n(M3d-M3g), the terrain was hilly, with slopes of varying steepness and regions of differing sand density.\nScattered throughout the area were sharp volcanic boulders of various sizes.\nA particular challenge in this mission was the traversal of a narrow valley (Figure\n4\n(M3e)).\nThe mission was planned from a road to a target location in the center of the field and back, as shown in Figure\n4\n(M3a) in\ngreen\nand\nblue\n, respectively.\nA long hill between the start and goal required the global path to be routed around it, as the local planner could not account for an obstacle of that scale.\nThree operator interventions were required during the mission.\nThe first intervention occurred when the locomotion controller failed to recognize a small hole next to a rock and did not lift its foot high enough to clear it, causing repeated collisions with the obstacle.\nFor the other two interventions, the operator had to manually steer the robot because the local\nplanner’s\nvelocity\ncommands, although correctly oriented, did not generate enough forward velocity to overcome slipping in fine sand uphill. One example is shown in Figure\n4\n(M3g).\nFigure\n4\n(M3f) shows another incident, where the robot failed to climb on the left side of a rock but succeeded on the right during the second attempt, highlighting how identical slopes and appearances can mask different soil behaviors.\nOne challenge for localization occurred in the narrow valley, where the surrounding terrain further degraded GNSS reception and increased the uncertainty to approximately\n±\n6\nm\n\\pm 6\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{m}\nfrom the nominal\n±\n2\n−\n3\nm\n\\pm 2-3\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{m}\n.\nDespite the reduced signal quality, the consistent local frame provided by the SLAM system helped the fusion-based localization maintain a stable global pose estimate and prevent deviation with respect to the target global robot position. While the synergetic effect of GNSS and point-cloud SLAM mitigated the issue, more reliable and environment-invariant sensing modalities should be investigated to prevent such cases.\nA helium source was placed inside the valley, shown as a star in Figure\n4\n(M3a).\nThe robot did not detect the gas on its first pass, likely because the plume was dispersed by the wind away from the inlet, but it successfully measured it during the return traversal, as shown in the time series in Figure\n4\n(M3c).\nIn this plot, the grey line indicates a measurement pause, during which the operator temporarily halted data collection and repositioned the robot to better analyze the surroundings.\nOverall, these field trials show that fully autonomous volcanic exploration with integrated gas sensing is feasible and effective, with robust system performance across diverse terrains.\nHowever, the performance is strongly coupled to environmental conditions.\nThe experiments demonstrated how wind-driven plume dispersion significantly impacts gas detection reliability, underscoring the importance of perception and planning modules that actively consider wind dynamics and plume movement.\nAt the same time, the operator interventions revealed key limitations in autonomy: imperfect global-to-local path alignment, uncertainty in terrain traversability, and partial observability in visually uniform landscapes.\nThese aspects are discussed in more detail in Section\nV\n.\nIV\nVOLCANIC PLUME MEASURING\nFigure 6:\nOverview of the fumarole measurement on Mount Etna.\n(a-c) Close-up views of

relative\nSO\n2\n\\text{SO}{\\vphantom{\\text{X}}}_{\\smash[t]{\\text{2}}}\nconcentration.\nWe conducted one teleoperated test near active fumaroles inside the Laghetto crater on Mount Etna.\nThese fumaroles were located on a side slope with very loose ground, as shown in Figure\n6\na-f.\nThe path leading to the plumes was narrow and ran nearly parallel to the contour lines with a subtle inclination with respect to the horizontal ground.\nWhile the central foot trail consisted of compacted soil, the surrounding areas were covered with loose, deep sand.\nAutonomous operation was infeasible, as even small lateral steps caused the robot’s feet to sink deeply into the substrate (Figure\n6\nf).\nThe teleoperated mission took place under moderate wind conditions, which caused plume dilution and made gas measurements challenging, as the plume shifted rapidly around the robot.\nWe monitored water vapor (\nH\n2\n​\nO\n\\text{H}{\\vphantom{\\text{X}}}_{\\smash[t]{\\text{2}}}\\text{O}\n,\n18\namu\n18\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{a}\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{u}\n), hydrogen sulfide (\nH\n2\n​\nS\n\\text{H}{\\vphantom{\\text{X}}}_{\\smash[t]{\\text{2}}}\\text{S}\n,\n34\namu\n34\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{a}\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{u}\n), carbon dioxide (\nCO\n2\n\\text{CO}{\\vphantom{\\text{X}}}_{\\smash[t]{\\text{2}}}\n,\n44\namu\n44\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{a}\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{u}\n), and sulfur dioxide (\nSO\n2\n\\text{SO}{\\vphantom{\\text{X}}}_{\\smash[t]{\\text{2}}}\n,\n64\namu\n64\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{a}\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{u}\n) as key volcanic volatiles, and nitrogen (\nN\n2\n\\text{N}{\\vphantom{\\text{X}}}_{\\smash[t]{\\text{2}}}\n,\n28\namu\n28\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{a}\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{u}\n) as a background reference.\nThe robot was commanded to move along the slope, occasionally stopping in areas where water vapor was visible.\nFigure\n6\nk visualizes the measurement site and the robot’s trajectory, while Figure\n6\nh shows the recorded gas concentrations over time.\nA distinct peak in sulfur dioxide is visible, corresponding to the time when the robot was directly adjacent to the fumarole.\nA smaller rise in sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide was detected when the robot turned around and started its return.\nIn contrast, no clear increase in water vapor concentration was observed, likely because of the already high ambient humidity levels, which made plume-related variations difficult to distinguish.\nTo validate the gas measurements obtained with the onboard mass spectrometer, we collected measurements manually using a miniGAS instrument (INFICON Hapsite\n®\nScout), which combines\nGNSS\ndata, temperature, pressure, and relative humidity with multiple electrochemical sensors, including those for\nCO\n2\n\\text{CO}{\\vphantom{\\text{X}}}_{\\smash[t]{\\text{2}}}\nand\nSO\n2\n\\text{SO}{\\vphantom{\\text{X}}}_{\\smash[t]{\\text{2}}}\n.\nThe handheld instrument was carried along the same path and positioned in visible plumes to obtain reference readings.\nFigure\n6\ni shows the corresponding\nCO\n2\n\\text{CO}{\\vphantom{\\text{X}}}_{\\smash[t]{\\text{2}}}\nmeasurements plotted at the recorded locations, confirming the same fumarole positions as observed in Figure\n6\nk.\nWhile the miniGAS\nSO\n2\n\\text{SO}{\\vphantom{\\text{X}}}_{\\smash[t]{\\text{2}}}\nsensor did not register a clear signal, the robot-mounted mass spectrometer successfully detected a pronounced sulfur dioxide peak from approximately\n0.5\nm\n0.5\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{m}\naway.\nConversely, the stronger\nCO\n2\n\\text{CO}{\\vphantom{\\text{X}}}_{\\smash[t]{\\text{2}}}\nresponse of the handheld sensor can be attributed to its direct proximity to the emission source.\nTogether, these results confirm the consistency between both sensing methods and support the reliability of the robot-mounted mass spectrometer for in situ volcanic gas analysis.\nV\nLESSONS LEARNED\nV-A\nVolcanic Gas Analysis\nThe robot successfully traversed the volcanic terrain in order to reach active fumaroles and conducted gas measurements, detecting distinct gas compositions from different plumes.\nHowever, the real-world deployment also revealed several practical challenges that are important to consider for the future.\nFirst, volcanic gas plumes are highly transient, particularly under strong wind conditions.\nEven with a fast and sensitive instrument such as the mass spectrometer, plume dispersion occasionally prevented accurate detection.\nThis highlights the need for measurement strategies that better account for environmental conditions, such as incorporating visual gas-source detection or wind sensing for plume prediction.\nSecond, for ground-level gases at low concentrations, the current inlet setup, mounted approximately\n0.75\nm\n0.75\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{m}\nabove the ground, may be too high to effectively sample the plume.\nFuture solutions would benefit from a deployable inlet mechanism capable of positioning the sampling point directly at or near the emission source.\nV-B\nAutonomy and Mobility\nThe autonomous missions demonstrated that reliable navigation on volcanic terrain is feasible, with autonomy rates exceeding 90%.\nAcross three distinct environments – crater rim, crater descent, and volcanic desert – the robot consistently executed complex paths with minimal operator intervention, confirming the robustness of the navigation stack.\nNevertheless, the few required interventions provided valuable insights into the remaining limitations of the system and highlighted directions for future development.\nPlanning\nbased on global satellite data remains challenging due to its coarse resolution and limited positional accuracy.\nWhen following existing trails, the global path accuracy was occasionally affected by misalignments between the OpenStreetMap data and the actual ground path.\nWhen planning across open terrain, the operator relied on prior knowledge of large obstacles, such as the untraversable hill in the volcanic desert, that were not visible in satellite imagery.\nAlthough such offsets are expected, they can result in infeasible goals for the local planner.\nAn exploration planner could mitigate this issue by finding alternative paths around obstacles; however, for large obstacles such as an extended wall of rocks encountered in Mission 3 (Volcanic Desert), this approach can result in unnecessarily long or inefficient detours, thereby reducing the robot’s overall operational range during long missions.\nTo overcome these limitations, future systems should reduce the information gap between global and local planning.\nRather than propagating only discrete waypoints, we propose continuously integrating local observations and feeding them back into the global map to update the current path.\nThis process could be complemented by active perception, where the robot scans its surroundings to evaluate multiple feasible route options before proceeding.\nPerception and Localization\nproved challenging in the volcanic environment.\nThe robot’s motion stirred up dust and fine sand, which intermittently degraded both depth camera and LiDAR data.\nLiDAR-based localization also suffered: scan matching frequently became underconstrained on planar, self-similar slopes, and transient dust returns introduced noise points that increased alignment error and drift.\nGNSS offered limited support, as satellite coverage was often poor near crater rims and steep walls, leading to a low-quality signal with high variance and occasional dropouts.\nMoreover, visual appearance often did not reflect the true soil stability, leading to errors in traversability estimation.\nA promising solution is adaptive traversability estimation, where the robot refines its terrain model online using feedback from physical interaction.\nLocomotion\nperformance during the field tests demonstrated robust operation on volcanic terrain.\nOver five days of testing across diverse surface types, the robot experienced no falls, highlighting the maturity of current quadruped locomotion policies.\nNevertheless, when confronted with even more demanding conditions, such as those encountered during the teleoperated tests, limitations became apparent.\nAchieving full autonomy capable of reaching fumaroles will likely require reliable traversal of very fine sand on steep slopes – conditions that remain challenging for existing foot designs and locomotion strategies.\nImproved foot geometries and adaptive contact mechanisms represent a promising approach to increasing stability and traction under these conditions.\nVI\nCONCLUSION\nIn this work, we present a robotic system for autonomous measurement of volcanic gases in challenging terrain.\nThe design integrates a mass spectrometer for fast and accurate in situ gas analysis with an autonomy stack that enables long-range traverses across unstructured terrain.\nThrough a series of field trials on Mount Etna, we demonstrated robust navigation across complex volcanic terrain and performed the first successful in situ gas measurements by a ground-based mobile robot on an active volcano, serving as a proof-of-concept.\nThese results establish the proposed system as a viable solution for autonomous volcanic gas analysis, highlighting its potential for advancing field volcanology.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank Simona Scollo, Fabrizia Buongiorno, Gaetano Giudice, Roberto Maugeri, Emilio Pecora, and

    "preview_text": "Volcanic gas emissions are key precursors of eruptive activity. Yet, obtaining accurate near-surface measurements remains hazardous and logistically challenging, motivating the need for autonomous solutions. Limited mobility in rough volcanic terrain has prevented wheeled systems from performing reliable in situ gas measurements, reducing their usefulness as sensing platforms. We present a legged robotic system for autonomous volcanic gas analysis, utilizing the quadruped ANYmal, equipped with a quadrupole mass spectrometer system. Our modular autonomy stack integrates a mission planning interface, global planner, localization framework, and terrain-aware local navigation. We evaluated the system on Mount Etna across three autonomous missions in varied terrain, achieving successful gas-source detections with autonomy rates of 93-100%. In addition, we conducted a teleoperated mission in which the robot measured natural fumaroles, detecting sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide. We discuss lessons learned from the gas-analysis and autonomy perspectives, emphasizing the need for adaptive sensing strategies, tighter integration of global and local planning, and improved hardware design.\n\nAI\nArtificial Intelligence\nLLM\nLarge Language Model\nVLA\nVision Language Action\nVLM\nVision Language Model\nRT\nReal-Time\nGT\nGround Truth\nGNSS\nGlobal Navigation Satellite System\nRTK\nReal-time Kinematic Positioning\nLiDAR\nLight Detection and Ranging\nIMU\nInertial Measurement Unit\nRPE\nRelative Position Error\nRRE\nRelative Rotation Error\nAPE\nAbsolute Position Error\nARE\nRelative Rotation Error\nRL\nreinforcement-learning\nHF\nHolistic Fusion\nMAP\nMaximum a Posteriori\nSLAM\nSimultaneous Localization and Mapping\nGUI\nGraphical User Interface\nLarge-Scale Autonomous Gas Monitoring for Volcanic Environments:\nA Legged Robot on Mount Etna\nJulia Richter\n1\n,\nTurcan Tuna\n1\n,\nManthan Patel\n1\n,\nTakahiro Miki\n1\n,\nDevon Higgins\n2\n,\nJames Fox\n2\n,\nCesar Cadena\n1\n,\nAndres Diaz\n2\n,\nand Marco Hutter\n1\n1\nRobotic Systems Lab (RS",
